00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
just to remind folks where we were
 
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
when you look back
 
00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 align:start position:0%
at the house DNA committee that met in
 
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
February we had a recommendation that
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
came out of the ENA committee for
 
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
interim study and that vote
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
um did come out of the house unanimously
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
and then it did go on the house floor as
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote for interim study
 
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
um and we did feel that
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
it was important for us to take another
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
look here at it ask some questions and
 
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
hear from folks who had
 
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
and hear from folks who had uh
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input thank you
 
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
um so with that I will look to either
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
one of my two colleagues here to
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
um also ask any questions should they
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
great so um for the author of the The
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
Bill representative partial if you
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind uh coming up and for the
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
yes I have partial representing marble
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative I have had the chance to
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
take a look at uh pieces of legislation
 
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
um that are germane that have that have
 
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.270 align:start position:0%
um that are germane that have that have
um

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
that are either in the process or are
 
00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
continuing to work through the
 
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
legislatures in other neighboring states
 
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 align:start position:0%
and I am curious to know
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
um sort of how
 
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
the formation of of the charge of the
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
commission was formed
 
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
and so if you could speak to that I
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
noticed that you have two members of the
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
House a member of the Senate
 
00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
and a member of Des one member of North
 
00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
East resource recovery Association a
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
member of the New Hampshire
 
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and a member of
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
Northeast Recycling council do do you
 
00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:37.139 align:start position:0%
have any other thoughts about the
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
composition of that proposed Commission
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
not necessarily although I think that we
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
should have all interested stakeholders
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
present and if there were
 
00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 align:start position:0%
advocates for other systems Beyond uh
 
00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:53.450 align:start position:0%
advocates for other systems Beyond uh
um

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
Beyond uh extended producer
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility and perhaps their voices
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
questions that um
 
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
do or do not um include producer
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders so that's one one entity
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
that I was noticing that was perhaps not
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
named directly in the charge of the
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
commission and I didn't know if that was
 
00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:21.539 align:start position:0%
intentional or if that is
 
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
um if you had thoughts as to why why
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
that was the way it was I will I'll
 
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220 align:start position:0%
quickly admit that was not intentional I
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
think that it's important to have a
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
broad swath of Representatives
 
00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:34.909 align:start position:0%
broad swath of Representatives
um

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
I just could not find a
 
00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:40.979 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist group I guess you'd say that
 
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
would advocate for
 
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
um or against
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much
 
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
the question I had was what what was the
 
00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.220 align:start position:0%
impetus for you to feel like that that
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
we should be looking towards our waste
 
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
reduction goals right now for extended
 
00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:05.210 align:start position:0%
reduction goals right now for extended
producer

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
producer
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
UH responsibilities just what how do you
 
00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:10.019 align:start position:0%
feel at this point not how do you feel
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
but what is your information on
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
um our waste reduction
 
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
abilities now my information uh beyond
 
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
what uh our 1990 study was in waste
 
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.150 align:start position:0%
what uh our 1990 study was in waste
reduction

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
was that speaking with my local uh
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal board and with the local
 
00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
transfer station
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
and they are both very deeply concerned
 
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
about this issue I imagine met very many
 
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
Municipal boards are
 
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.889 align:start position:0%
Municipal boards are
um

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
China we have we no longer have a source
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
for our for much of our disposables
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
um and you know there's two aspects of
 
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
this one is the packaging and the other
 
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.530 align:start position:0%
this one is the packaging and the other
is

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
the actual products that we dispose of
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
and speaking of the packaging
 
00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:54.590 align:start position:0%
and speaking of the packaging
um

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
we have mandatory recycling in Marlboro
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
but once we collect it it really does
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
not get uh there's no place to put it
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
about nine bottles on average just say
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
these soda bottles example about nine
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
bottles out of 100 actually get recycled
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
the rest end up in our landfill
 
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's just um
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
so it was so the impetus for this to
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
answer your question I think would be
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
uh in in the bill in for the study
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
committee you
 
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540 align:start position:0%
um discussed RSA 149 Dash M with you
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
know emphasis on Improvement of
 
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
Municipal recycling what are those goals
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
what are the goals in that RSA
 
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:44.700 align:start position:0%
I don't have that right okay so all
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
right let me look it up real quick and
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
I'll uh
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
let's see here
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like the goals it says here are
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
by the year 2000 is to achieve a 40
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
minimum weight diversion of solid waste
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
landfill or incineration per on per
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
capita basis that was in 1999. do you
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
have any do you have any actual data on
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
from 1999 to
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
you know this was in a year so this is
 
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
effective 1999 in the
 
00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:14.579 align:start position:0%
looks like the the RSA said in a year
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to achieve a 40 we have
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
fallen far short of that well I I guess
 
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
I don't understand that the gold you
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
know the impetus of how that goal was
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
even made because I'm not sure anybody
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
could make a one-year goal of reducing
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
something by 40 percent
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
do you know how this has been taken
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
seriously in any way RSA 149 colon m
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
M oh I do not okay
 
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:40.019 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
question uh just a point of
 
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.490 align:start position:0%
question uh just a point of
clarification

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify I I have
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
participated myself in solid waste
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
recycling study committee
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
um in the year 2019 where four members
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
sat on that committee and there is
 
00:11:59.569 --> 00:11:59.579 align:start position:0%
currently the solid waste working group
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
that is underway so I did have some
 
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899 align:start position:0%
questions with regard to some of the
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
charges within this bill and I was
 
00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:08.899 align:start position:0%
curious to know about whether or not
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
starting on line 20 to 22.
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
um the charges
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
um here talk about the emphasis of
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
improving Municipal recycling solid
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
waste flow and the reduction of taxpayer
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
costs and the support of transfer
 
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
stations throughout extended producing
 
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.750 align:start position:0%
stations throughout extended producing
responsibility

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and while while that
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
um is certainly germane to this I'm
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
curious to know if there are additional
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
things that you might include in the
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
charge of something that was solely
 
00:12:46.129 --> 00:12:46.139 align:start position:0%
focused on extended producer
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
responsibility well my personal opinion
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
is that a project of this magnitude
 
00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:55.740 align:start position:0%
is sufficient to itself and while I
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
think solved waste reduction group
 
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.629 align:start position:0%
think solved waste reduction group
programs

00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
need to be part of this and I think that
 
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
we need to use every approach every tool
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
that is available to us
 
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
I do see this particular bill as
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
something that is attacking a
 
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.129 align:start position:0%
something that is attacking a
individual

00:13:12.129 --> 00:13:12.139 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
unique situation that we can make
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
progress with therefore I recommend the
 
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
scope of a study group to be limited to
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
follow up if I'm going to recognize
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
myself for a follow-up so so with that
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
you're really looking at the packaging
 
00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:35.459 align:start position:0%
the way materials are packaged in the
 
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire or and the reason
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
I asked sorry the reason I do ask is
 
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
um that extended producer responsibility
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
generally speaking has a very unique
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
lens and it looks at pretty specific
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
portions of how we manage our solid
 
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.370 align:start position:0%
portions of how we manage our solid
waste

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
waste
 
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.970 align:start position:0%
waste
um

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
um yes I I'm not looking at this as a
 
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
packaging Bill although I think that can
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
have a significant impact but I also
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
um we have tipping fees on many of our
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
electronic products and the like uh
 
00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
tires there was a bill this passed a
 
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
bionum to uh uh build in cost of solar
 
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
panel um disposal
 
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:21.829 align:start position:0%
panel um disposal
um

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
I think these are all valid concerns and
 
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
while my particular emphasis is on
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
the waste that's being produced I cannot
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
turn a blind eye to uh those other very
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
significant factors in our landfills as
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
well some are very toxic in fact and
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
they do need this attention
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I do notice that there's
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department of
 
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services here so um you're
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
welcome to sort of
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to recognize the department
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
for a moment if that's that's okay
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to come sit at this other
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
chair so that you have a microphone we
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
can learn to be
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
Mr wimsat uh if you wouldn't mind for
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
the record just stating your name and
 
00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:23.180 align:start position:0%
my name is
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
service director underway Community
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
provision for the New Hampshire
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I would like to
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
sort of discuss and hear your thoughts
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
um is uh about the formation of a
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
commission such as this and as we know
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
that the difference in a commission is
 
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.060 align:start position:0%
obviously that there is generally
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input and I did notice the
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
original version did not have producer
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders involved in the
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
conversation and we were just briefly
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
commenting that that is probably an
 
00:16:10.129 --> 00:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
important part of the conversation
 
00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:13.139 align:start position:0%
um to include but my thoughts are
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
on the larger sort of scope of this uh
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the charge that we saw
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
below do you feel that there are any
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
redundancies or overlaps and what is
 
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
going on currently with the solid waste
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
working group
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
um well that that that's a fair question
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
if I if I may uh just as a point of
 
00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
clarification before we talk about that
 
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
the representative looked online to look
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
at the reduction goal in the statute and
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
I think things are a little behind on
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
that because the there was a reduction
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
goal that was it was completely changed
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
more recently within the last couple of
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
years and that's at RSA 149 M2 and it
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
basically has been updated and I'll just
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
if I may describe it briefly to
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
establish a goal to reduce disposable
 
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
Municipal solid waste and construction
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
demolition debris by 25 by 2030 and 45
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
by 2050. so the
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
um the the goal that the representative
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
was doing was an older one that has been
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
supplanted now so okay great
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
um so so those are very relevant and
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
current and I and I I think this this
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
particular uh work session is timely in
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
the sense that we just issued an updated
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management plan last Friday
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
um September 30th uh which should which
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
uh has a lot of language which which
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
basically sets out broad
 
00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
um uh goals strategies and actions that
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
we intend to take over the next 10 years
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
to try to as among many things but
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
really as a focus to try to achieve that
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
reduction goal that's been established
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
that waste reduction goal and um
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
part of that will certainly be and
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the in the text of the
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
plan our interest in exploring
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
legislation on many things including
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility and
 
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
other methods of improving diversion
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
trying to get more certainly emphasizing
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
getting more infrastructure in the state
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
that's focused on non-disposal options
 
00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
for Waste such as a materials recovery
 
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
facility for recyclables
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
more construction demolition debris
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
recycling facilities than we currently
 
00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:26.710 align:start position:0%
recycling facilities than we currently
have

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
compost and other technologies that we
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
really don't have right now such as
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
anaerobic digestion we do have some
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
composting facilities in the state for
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
food waste and organic waste but we need
 
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
many more so this is a very timely
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
discussion I think and certainly during
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
this session
 
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.049 align:start position:0%
this session
um

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Des didn't necessarily
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
take a position on this bill but we were
 
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
tracking it and um but I think that with
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
the uh published the publication of the
 
00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
solid race management plan very recently
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
uh the idea of the legislature
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
assembling a commission to look at these
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
issues and I'll get to your question I
 
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.529 align:start position:0%
issues and I'll get to your question I
promise

00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
promise
 
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
um is is appropriate um and that perhaps
 
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility having
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
a commission that focuses on that is is
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
helpful because that's a really big even
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
though it's it's one sort of approach it
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
has very broad potential application for
 
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
a variety of products not just packaging
 
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
but other materials as well so I think
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
it in and of itself it's a it's a worthy
 
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
issue of study as far as uh whether the
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
how that overlaps potentially with the
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
current work of the solid waste working
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
group I I might defer to representative
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
evil who also chairs the solid waste
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
working group and I think with with her
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
in the room I might be inclined to to
 
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
allow her to address that question if
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair of the solid waste
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
working group yep uh good morning for
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Karen Ebel and I
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
represent Merrimack District Five New
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
London and Newbury and I am in fact the
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
chair of the solid waste working group
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
so I I think if I understood your
 
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
question correctly what you were trying
 
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
to get at is whether a commission that
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
was established to focus on
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
epr would be duplicative of work that
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group was going
 
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
to be doing
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a challenging question
 
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
because I really have to go back to the
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group and ask them
 
00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:45.500 align:start position:0%
where they want to focus next
 
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself I think epr is way
 
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:54.980 align:start position:0%
up on the priority scale for analysis
 
00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
we definitely want to focus on as they
 
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
say the front end of the pipe instead of
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
the back end of the pipe I was really
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
struck at a conference I attended
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
recently that
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
someone from a recycling
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
non-profit was talking about how for so
 
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.370 align:start position:0%
non-profit was talking about how for so
long

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
um consumers have been expected to be
 
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
the ones to have to deal with uh with
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
packaging that was produced and it was
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
sort of their problem and I think more
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
and more
 
00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
manufacturers should be looked at to try
 
00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
to help the situation with solid waste
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
by decreasing
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
decreasing the packaging that they're
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
producing focusing more on the
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
recyclability of it if it does go
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
through the pipe and and so I think
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at epr but from a
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
timing standpoint I don't I'm not sure
 
00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:56.299 align:start position:0%
exactly when that will happen
 
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
I do have one other comment I I did
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
share the hb61 seven recycling installed
 
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
waste study committee that was a
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
legislator only study committee not a
 
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.430 align:start position:0%
legislator only study committee not a
commission

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody could say that
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
that was an unsuccessful
 
00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:20.110 align:start position:0%
that was an unsuccessful
Endeavor

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
Endeavor
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
and honestly everybody who was
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
interested in the issue of solid waste
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
was given ample time to testify and
 
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.210 align:start position:0%
was given ample time to testify and
um

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
and they followed the situation all the
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
time so although it's important on the
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
one hand when you have a commission to
 
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
have various voices on the table it's
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
not like people can't participate on an
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis and
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
I thought the way we handled it was
 
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
really successful the only other thing
 
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
I'll say about commissions is that
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
whereas a legislative committee can come
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
together really quickly if you have a
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
commission that requires a lot of
 
00:23:08.049 --> 00:23:08.059 align:start position:0%
appointments by different people it can
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
delay the the startup time so that's
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
just a consideration I appreciate the
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
perspective thank you one of the other
 
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
things that I was curious about is sort
 
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I know that the New Hampshire
 
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association was named as a
 
00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group here and I think there
 
00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.780 align:start position:0%
might be somebody
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
nope there isn't actually
 
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
um and so but
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
um to which
 
00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
to which to your point I think I I have
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
a question of of the impact that
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility has on
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as the consumer
 
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
and I think that that relationship of
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
what happens uh to the refuse at the
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
municipal level is probably also an
 
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
important aspect to look into I don't
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
know if you would agree or not
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I definitely uh agree I have to say
 
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
when I first came at this issue
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
um in 2019 my overriding concern was the
 
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
effect of the um
 
00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:18.299 align:start position:0%
the decision of China not to take a lot
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
of our Plastics and mixed paper and so I
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
mean I think the impact of all of this
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
is really really
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
um tough for for municipalities and if
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
they were able to deal with less refuse
 
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they would appreciate it
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to make sure that I'm
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding everything we're doing
 
00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
today we're discussing whether we're
 
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
going to have a
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
we're studying if we're going to have a
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
study commission right just to make sure
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
we understand that that I understand
 
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:57.649 align:start position:0%
we understand that that I understand
that

00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:00.049 --> 00:25:00.059 align:start position:0%
what I what I'd like to know is that
 
00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
I'm we have goals on the books of what
 
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
our goals are that you all have goals
 
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
that you're working towards as well on
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
our behalf
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
the commission is looking at these at
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
waste reduction right now the committee
 
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
do we need a commission on top of that
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
or is that something since this as it's
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
been communicated that this is a
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
priority and this is something of Des
 
00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:24.409 align:start position:0%
priority and this is something of Des
interest

00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
why can't we have that conversation
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
and put it in the right priority without
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
an additional study Commission
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
because I the only reason I'm asking
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not to critique anything
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's just that I mean like say for
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
instance today we can't get a quorum
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
together because people are you know
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
time time time time is time
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
so isn't this something that can already
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
be discussed an important issue that can
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
be discussed under our current framework
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
of what we have right now
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
so I I don't want to speak for the solid
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
waste work group I'm a member of the
 
00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group um that is an
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
August group it's 20 I think people that
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
represent all uh that was both
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
legislative representation and solid
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
waste industry environmental groups it
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
has a really broad
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
um broad spectrum of representation they
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot of work to do they have a lot
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
of topics and as representative has
 
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
indicated epr is definitely one of the
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
things that is high on the list I think
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
is what she said so I I don't think it's
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
des's place to say whether an extra
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
commission or the working group but from
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
my perspective as a member of the
 
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
working group
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
um I think it's certainly something that
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
that group could have a very informed
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
discussion on and could help to develop
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
some recommendations so I I think it can
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
certainly work within the context of the
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
and again all I'm asking really and I
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate answering that all I'm trying
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
to get at is do we already have the
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
capability and and people in the room
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
that can have this discussion and put it
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the right priority because
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
even if we have a study commission that
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
handles this then whatever comes out of
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
that study commission is going right
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
back into the same pipeline that you all
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
are doing for implementation so it's
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like the talk can't keep up
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
with the action you know what I mean
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
um yes ma'am
 
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
um I actually think that this is going
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
to come up many times over the over the
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
next term because the the issue of solid
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
waste is really one that um
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased to say is getting a lot of
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
attention and I think
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
um people in the legislature are going
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
to have to decide whether they want to
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
have study committees that are going
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
forward while the solid waste working
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
group is working while Des is working on
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
its implementation plans
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
I I have I'm going to be honest I have
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat mixed feelings about it except
 
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.490 align:start position:0%
somewhat mixed feelings about it except
that

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group you know
 
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
we had so many responsibilities anyway
 
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit my fault because I
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
wrote the Bill but
 
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
um uh we have accomplished one though we
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
have the long range plan out we have a
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
lot of responsibilities but we gained
 
00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
even more responsibilities when
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
legislation was amended to create study
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
committees instead of going for you know
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
for us meaning for us to study more
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
um things so we just we're not going to
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
be able to do everything in the year
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
I mean I can't say that I think it would
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
be a bad idea for the legislature to
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
just sort of zero in on this issue and
 
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
and talk about it I mean I've I've had
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
another concept if you didn't want to
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
just go straight to us if you didn't
 
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:48.539 align:start position:0%
want to do a study committee you could
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
start with a bill and start working
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
um working in that direction I think epr
 
00:28:57.529 --> 00:28:57.539 align:start position:0%
is a really really
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
important discussion for the state to
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
have because I feel like it should
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
appeal to
 
00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:06.299 align:start position:0%
all parties
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
meaning political parties and views of
 
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
of you know and perspectives because
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a Yankee tradition that you
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for what you're
 
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.269 align:start position:0%
take responsibility for what you're
producing

00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
producing
 
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
um and I think it would be great to
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
focus at the front end of the pipe and
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
our and you know we can talk to people
 
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:28.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
if I may really quickly and then I I
 
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
will recognize you next So speaking of
 
00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:34.909 align:start position:0%
will recognize you next So speaking of
Maine

00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
um I have taken the time to look at um
 
00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
with with
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
good intention uh and the extended
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
producer Responsibility program that
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
they have and it looks like parts of it
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
are being implemented currently it may
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
take almost the better part of seven to
 
00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
ten years to fully Implement their
 
00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:55.970 align:start position:0%
ten years to fully Implement their
program

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
um and so what that tells me is that
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
there is a significant amount of
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
material that would need to be covered
 
00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.070 align:start position:0%
material that would need to be covered
in

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.029 align:start position:0%
in
um

00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
the concept of extended producer
 
00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure that we are
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
truly getting the full scope of what it
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
may entail and when I was asking some of
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
those questions that is
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
um to representative partial it is sort
 
00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
of with that in mind and understanding
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
that this is not just necessarily about
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
packaging it involves many different
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and and too much to that
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
end I wanted to make sure that
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
if it went in the way of a commission
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
that that would not be duplicative but
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
also give folks the appropriate amount
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
of time to sort of
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.409 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
00:30:57.169 --> 00:30:57.179 align:start position:0%
um I I would also advocate for a
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
commission because this is a very
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
rapidly changing landscape we are
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
dealing with right now recently
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
California is a who is a very big player
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
thus came in with their own version of
 
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
the EPA epr
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
and Amazon has recently uh started uh
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
putting teeth into their requirement
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
that products being shipped to Germany
 
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:21.059 align:start position:0%
into France and some other places carry
 
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
the registration I I think that there's
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
a lot of moving Parts here and uh I will
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
be honest I do not understand all of
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
them I know this Solid Waste work has a
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
much deeper understanding than I do over
 
00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
these uh various parts but I think a
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
study commission could address that on a
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
long term basis and get all the players
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
into one place and one other thing I
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
would like to add at some point is we
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
have today uh Bonnie Christie here and I
 
00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
think she might be able to answer some
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
of your questions on the municipal
 
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
impact of uh
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
well that's what we're currently doing
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I'd like to
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
oh sure thank you
 
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:03.049 align:start position:0%
oh sure thank you
um

00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:03.059 --> 00:32:05.029 align:start position:0%
um
representative

00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
um partial had suggested that you might
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
have some input on the municipal sort of
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
aspect of things and so with that I'll
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
call you
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm Bonnie Christie I'm from
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton and I am the chair of the
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton waste reduction committee and
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
I'm also on the Joint Committee with the
 
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:33.419 align:start position:0%
town of Webster we share a transfer
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
station and we have a overarching
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
committee that runs the operations of
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
the transfer station and I submitted
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
testimony in January on representative
 
00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
partials bill 1111.
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
um from from the perspective of not not
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
having an opinion about
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
well an opinion that we could really
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
benefit in municipalities from epr
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
and I don't have an opinion on what form
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
because I know Maine has their own epr
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
and I believe Oregon has theirs I think
 
00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:13.940 align:start position:0%
maybe Colorado past epr and it's pretty
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
individualized by the state
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
but what we're experiencing in Hopkinton
 
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm sure is the same in all
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities our waste load is growing
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
and growing
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
and we do our best
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
with our staff to recycle we do
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
diversion recycle and we're working on
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
composting now we don't have that in
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
place yet but we're trying to divert
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
but even with all our efforts excuse me
 
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
our best efforts we can't keep up with
 
00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:48.419 align:start position:0%
it and it's becoming more and more
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
expensive and until 2021 we paid 72
 
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
dollars a ton to dispose of our refuse
 
00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:57.779 align:start position:0%
in the landfill or incinerator
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
and then it jumped ten dollars a ton in
 
00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:03.539 align:start position:0%
the first year and every year it's going
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
up and up and up with our new contract
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll be paying about a hundred
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
dollars a ton in 2025.
 
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
so our waste is growing the cost of
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
disposing of the waste is growing we're
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
doing the best we can with the staff and
 
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:21.500 align:start position:0%
the tools we have in place but we can't
 
00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
manage this on our own we're going to
 
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
have to rebuild our entire recycling
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
facility in a couple of years and we had
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted 112 000 in the capital
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
Improvement plan A couple of years ago
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
we all know now that there's no way
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
we're going to rebuild that facility
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
with the way costs have changed in 2025
 
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
for a hundred and twelve thousand so we
 
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
are really interested in these top goals
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
from the new Solid Waste Management plan
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
which has Source reduction at the top
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's always been at the top it just
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
and we would be very excited and and
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
happy to participate in discussions
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
about how that Source reduction can
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
happen in the best way for New Hampshire
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that we're not advocating
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
duplicating what Maine did or Oregon or
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
any other state but
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
please help us
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
um we can't do it on our own and yeah
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's a consumer problem but it's also a
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
town problem
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that perspective thank you
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
representative Contour
 
00:35:30.359 --> 00:35:32.270 align:start position:0%
representative Contour
foreign

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of observations based
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
on the discussions
 
00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
um one is
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
if we start this commission I'm assuming
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to go for
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
probably a decade at least based on what
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
because we're talking you know several
 
00:35:56.099 --> 00:35:57.310 align:start position:0%
because we're talking you know several
years

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
the commission won't probably get
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
started until 2023 late 2023 sometime
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
and so part of my concern is and I do
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
sit on another commission so I'm well
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
aware of how they operate
 
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.010 align:start position:0%
aware of how they operate
um

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
and basically
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
the commission looks at everything but
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
then it's another year before
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislation even becomes introduced if
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
there's anything that needs to be done
 
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:30.230 align:start position:0%
there's anything that needs to be done
um

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
so although I'm not opposed to a
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
commission I do have some mixed feelings
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
about that that is that if this is such
 
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:40.140 align:start position:0%
an important issue that needs to be
 
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.270 align:start position:0%
an important issue that needs to be
addressed

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
say immediately sooner rather than later
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
um that the legislative approach
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
um might be more viable and getting
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
things done quicker from a legislative
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
perspective and I just wanted to make
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:04.619 align:start position:0%
I would I would like to hear sort of
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
the time frame that a commission might
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
um take and if if representative evil
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to speak to that again I
 
00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:19.370 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to speak to that again I
I

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
though the program itself might take a
 
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
decade to implement I I am hopeful that
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
a commission would not go for 10 years
 
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
but let's I would love to hear your
 
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
thoughts okay I have I have many
 
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:31.849 align:start position:0%
thoughts okay I have I have many
thoughts

00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
um one thing I just want to say is you
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
know whether the whether the ENA
 
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
recommends this for further uh
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group will be
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
meeting I believe on the 28th and we're
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about some of the
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
things that we're going to be focusing
 
00:37:55.079 --> 00:37:56.569 align:start position:0%
things that we're going to be focusing
on

00:37:56.569 --> 00:37:56.579 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and so if more legislation is
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
introduced in November and then you
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
start talking about it in January you're
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to have a pretty good idea at that
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
point what we're focusing on I'm sorry I
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
I can't be
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
better about the timing of all of this
 
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.870 align:start position:0%
better about the timing of all of this
but

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
um representative comtwa is right I mean
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
I I was Deputy speaker a couple of years
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
ago I know how long appointments take I
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
will say that commissions just take a
 
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
lot longer to get going because when you
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
have individuals from all different
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
walks of life you've got to identify
 
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.930 align:start position:0%
walks of life you've got to identify
them

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.010 align:start position:0%
them
um

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:36.660 align:start position:0%
and legislative study committees just
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
get going a lot faster and you can have
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
you can have everybody there you can
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
request I mean people will believe me if
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
they're interested they will be there
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
and you can
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I I did this once before actually in
 
00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:53.220 align:start position:0%
the dyslexia context where we kind of
 
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
created a working group around our
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
legislative study committee the only
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
other thing I'm going to say is that
 
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.069 align:start position:0%
other thing I'm going to say is that
every

00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
study committee or commission that you
 
00:39:06.849 --> 00:39:06.859 align:start position:0%
create on this issue you're getting Des
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
involved and Des is already short
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
staffed and it's pretty much always the
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
same people that have to be sitting here
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
that are working on legislation that are
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
doing the implementation plans that are
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know advising the solid waste
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
working group and then just doing the
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
basic work of of running the solid waste
 
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
Bureau so you know it's hard as I say I
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
had a lot of thoughts but I don't know
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
if that's helpful or not but
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
anyway that's what I would have to say
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
no I appreciate that representative and
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
then I will
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you uh for
 
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
um would you would a possibility be is
 
00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
to do like another working group like us
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
on or like underneath the solid waste
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
working group to you know establish like
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
take so many people and put it under
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
that to focus on different aspects
 
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:05.339 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to starting a commission
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
where you could just focus on the epr
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
side of things
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm thanks for mentioning
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
that I hadn't actually thought about
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
that but when we were kind of breaking
 
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.270 align:start position:0%
that but when we were kind of breaking
down

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
um how we were going to tackle advising
 
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
Des on the solid waste um plan we did
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
break down into subcommittees so that's
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's one one way that we could go
 
00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.849 align:start position:0%
that's one one way that we could go
um

00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's just
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
I wish I could be more definitive on
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
what the working group is going to do
 
00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
but we have to meet and we have to
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
discuss this um the other thing is that
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
under the terms of the statute the
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
working group has to introduce or
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
present an interim report by November
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
30th I don't know how detailed that's
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
going to be because the bulk of our work
 
00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579 align:start position:0%
really had to do with helping out with
 
00:41:01.569 --> 00:41:01.579 align:start position:0%
the long-range plan
 
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
but we might reflect some of our
 
00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
priorities in that report so there's a
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
lot of there's a lot of things going on
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
but of course you have to make your
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation by
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
November 1st good luck
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative thank you the question I
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
had is in Maine Oregon does anybody
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
anybody who knows this please shout out
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
but um shout out to it but did they
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
start with a
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.250 align:start position:0%
okay
sure

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
and the reason I'm wondering is it would
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be useful to find out who
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
may have started with a study Commission
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be a report
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
from that study commission I'm just
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
looking at instead of everybody
 
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:55.859 align:start position:0%
Reinventing the wheel Perhaps Perhaps
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
there's some really Germaine data in
 
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
their study commission report that that
 
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
sort of can answer some of the basic
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions that that we might be looking
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
at in a commission so then at that point
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
maybe that the looking at the problem
 
00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
gets a lot smaller and we could do that
 
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
within the context that we have or not
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
maybe there's still a need for a study
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
commission but I'm looking at how do we
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
not reinvent the Wheel from from process
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
one look at what somebody else possibly
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
I did speak with a senator from Maine
 
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
that sponsored this legislation and I
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
not 100 positive because this was a
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
conversation quite long ago when I have
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
to dig through my notes I believe they
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
did start with the study commission
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
however and it was a long process which
 
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
is why she said the sooner we get
 
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
started here
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
the sooner we can start actually
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
tackling this problem
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
and and I guess I know she'd be open to
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
further conversation sure sure and I
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
wondered is that something that is a is
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
that something that is a viable
 
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
possibility is starting with their
 
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
before we ask for a study commission
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe we start by asking is there
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
is there data in in somebody else's
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
commission report that basically covers
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
covers we're talking things outside of
 
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire here so these will some of
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
these answers will all be very Universal
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
together that states share yes sir yes I
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think that that we don't want to read
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
about the wheel I totally agreement on
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
that however I think that the solutions
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire needs are probably
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
different than the one maybe not so
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
different than Maine but definitely
 
00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:38.339 align:start position:0%
different than California and Oregon I
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
think that we could
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
probably benefit from getting
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
stakeholder interest from the people who
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
are here in New Hampshire
 
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
so that's why I mean I think that
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
looking other study commissions would be
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
of Paramount importance at the same time
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think we have to ask who's looking at
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
them and I think a study commission
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
would be the most appropriate venue for
 
00:44:01.809 --> 00:44:01.819 align:start position:0%
that because then you have all the
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's my personal opinion do you uh
 
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
does anybody think that
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
that some of this information if you
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
start at a point of like say this much
 
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
knowledge don't you think at that point
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
then the structures that we have and
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
again I'm not trying to debate whether a
 
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
study commission or not I'm not trying
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
to throw shade on that I'm just trying
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
to ask this question
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
do you think that if we got a leg up by
 
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the data that's out
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
there already that it would give the
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
existing resources that we have the
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
existing agency in the existing Solid
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
Waste Management Group
 
00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:37.940 align:start position:0%
the ability they need then to call in
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire stakeholders and get
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
their information I mean we could be
 
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
instead of starting from a position of
 
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
down here could that help us start from
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
a position of middle
 
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair yes okay absolutely thank
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
you sorry
 
00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
um you know as as part of our uh kind of
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
getting going with the solid waste
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
working group I actually invited in
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
folks from uh uh like the Des
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
counterparts in Vermont Massachusetts
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
and Maine and
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
um there is a discussion that was
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
recorded with the head of the solid
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
waste group I think her name is Pamela
 
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
Clark in Maine on what they've been
 
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:22.609 align:start position:0%
Clark in Maine on what they've been
doing

00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:23.210 align:start position:0%
doing
um

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
on epr among other things so that's
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
already there
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember if I asked
 
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
I wanted to put a link to what Maine had
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
done on our website on the waste working
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
group website I don't know if we did my
 
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.010 align:start position:0%
group website I don't know if we did my
recollection

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
recollection
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
is that there was a a study commission
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
at the legislative level they made
 
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
certain recommendations but I
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
I thought that what they did was they
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
turned it over kind of to the Des in
 
00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
Maine to make legislative
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations that that I'm looking at
 
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
the chair she's nodding I don't know
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative that's
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
correct and there's a certain amount of
 
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.030 align:start position:0%
correct and there's a certain amount of
of

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
post the
 
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
um study commission that did happen in
 
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine a lot of what was
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
hashed out was set forth in rule making
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
right so I I am aware that there there
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
was a commission in Maine there are
 
00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
other programs moving forward and there
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
are other pieces of legislation working
 
00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:26.579 align:start position:0%
through legislatures in Massachusetts
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
and New York respectively currently on
 
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
this subject
 
00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:32.089 align:start position:0%
this subject
um

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
so with that you know I do I to your
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
point it is a very it looks like there
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
are several different ways we can think
 
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.109 align:start position:0%
are several different ways we can think
about

00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
how best to move forward with the time
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
given but at the same point I do think
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
that this is a very complex issue that
 
00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
would require a dedicated set of eyes
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
and stakeholders involved in the
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
conversation now how we do that and how
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
we arrive at that might be different
 
00:46:58.970 --> 00:46:58.980 align:start position:0%
whether it's a committee a piece of
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
legislation or a commission that Still
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
Remains to be seen I
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
and if there is anybody else sitting
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
here I know there's people watching
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
intently over here so if you have other
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts you're welcome to contribute as
 
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:20.150 align:start position:0%
thoughts you're welcome to contribute as
well

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
director wimsat is there anything else
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
that you have that you would like to
 
00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:28.460 align:start position:0%
sort of communicate with us regarding
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
the ability for the Department to be
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
involved in such a commission would you
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
feel that the department would have
 
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:45.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you it's a very fair question
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
and the reality is that that every study
 
00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
commission or committee that we either
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
sit on and in a way it doesn't matter
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
this particular bill doesn't put the es
 
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
on the committee commission it puts a
 
00:48:01.970 --> 00:48:01.980 align:start position:0%
waste management council member on the
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
commission but it doesn't really matter
 
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
because we're always we always have to
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
be there and whether we sit on the
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
commission or we actually just come and
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
testify and provide information it is a
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
and and all of those are valuable and
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
valid and important but as
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
representative evil indicated
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
um we do get stretched then sometimes on
 
00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:23.099 align:start position:0%
you know particularly when there are
 
00:48:26.329 --> 00:48:26.339 align:start position:0%
multiple commissions so um as I said I'm
 
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
not sure it's Des role to say whether
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
the right way to do this is with a
 
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
commission or to try to have the solid
 
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:34.940 align:start position:0%
waste working group um handle it as well
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
what I will tell you is that you know
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
we've got a brand new Solid Waste
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
Management plan that absolutely
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
identifies extended producer
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility as something that we need
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
to explore through legislation I do
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
think that it's a topic that it isn't
 
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
you know at some level it's sort of
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
obvious yeah if you if you do that
 
00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's going to help right it's going to
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to mean that the producers
 
00:48:59.569 --> 00:48:59.579 align:start position:0%
are going to have some kind of and takes
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
different shapes and forms but the
 
00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
producers will have some kind of
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility to take pressure off of
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities which end up managing a
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
lot of the waste so in in a general
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
sense yes it it makes sense that you say
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
why do we need a commission but the
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
reality is that it differs for different
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
products and materials and it's
 
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:20.220 align:start position:0%
complicated there's and there's a lot of
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
moving parts right now a lot of States
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire has in a general
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
sense not been a leader on extended
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility although I will
 
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
correct that
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
um with one thing that we were actually
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
significant leaders on going way back to
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
the to the turn of the Millennium
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
um the interstate Mercury education
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
reduction Clearinghouse New Hampshire
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
was instrumental in working with the
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
other northeast states and in the
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
Canadian provinces to identify um
 
00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
ways to get Mercury out of products
 
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
Mercury added products and that has been
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
an amazing success story with that I the
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
the interstate uh Mercury and education
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
reduction Clearinghouse which is known
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
as imerc
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
um is run currently by the Northeast
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
Waste Management officials Association
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
which is an association of the eight uh
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
six New England states and and two in
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
New York and New Jersey
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
um that gets I I sit on their board as a
 
00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
represented for New Hampshire and uh
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
numoa is a small But Mighty organization
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
that that actually implements that that
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
program and it and it provides for
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
um using the laws that have been passed
 
00:50:32.089 --> 00:50:32.099 align:start position:0%
across the States including in New
 
00:50:34.609 --> 00:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for folks to producers to
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
identify Mercury content in their
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
products and and make sure that they're
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
working to get it out and when they
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
don't to have collection programs such
 
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
as for mercury thermostats so there's a
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
lot of history there and New Hampshire
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
was a leader on that in more recent
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
years other New England States in
 
00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
northeastern in States across the
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
country have been a lot more active than
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has on other extended
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility activities you
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
know in some respects in New Hampshire
 
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
we've really benefited from uh others
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
being the Laboratories for that and then
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
when it gets a little more mature and
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
it's working pretty well uh we we try to
 
00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
jump on that and I think that can happen
 
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
certainly for epr I think there's a lot
 
00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
going on a lot of states are learning
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
things right now but at the very least
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
even if we don't have a particular new
 
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
product that we impose an extended
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility law for we
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
should at least be educating both our
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
legislators and the communities in Des
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
on how it works how it can work and as
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
we move forward throughout the
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
implementation of our 10-year plan we
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
would certainly hope and expect that
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:44.099 align:start position:0%
legislation that will provide for
 
00:51:45.849 --> 00:51:45.859 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
programs where appropriate for various
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
products and we think that that is
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
absolutely going to be a important
 
00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
component of our overall attack on this
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.470 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
director

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
one is it possible for you to send us
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
that update a report that was just done
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
on the waste reduction or is there a
 
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
spot we can find that you mean the solid
 
00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.030 align:start position:0%
spot we can find that you mean the solid
waste

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
waste
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
absolutely as a matter of fact it's on
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
our website and we did I believe it was
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
sent to the chair of your committee by
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
memo probably probably with a link
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
rather that we're trying not to do as
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
much paper so it was probably a link but
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to you if I can tell you
 
00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:35.220 align:start position:0%
the quickest way to do it is is just to
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
go to our website and click on the solid
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
we go to the solid waste page and
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
there's the link there to that entire
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
report okay um we'll make sure that this
 
00:52:43.859 --> 00:52:44.990 align:start position:0%
report okay um we'll make sure that this
committee

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
um has all that information well thank
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
you for that and one other thing um is
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
there an epr association you had
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned about an association about
 
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
something else and is there an epr
 
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
association that is working together in
 
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
the New England states on how to go
 
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
forward with a lot of these issues
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
yes there so so I mentioned new MOA and
 
00:53:08.809 --> 00:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
then there's also an organization called
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
nerc or other uh Northeast uh recycling
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
Council which we in nemoa Works closely
 
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
we have an agreement to work closely on
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
these kinds of issues as a matter of
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
fact this is one of the issues we're
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
working on with them and there's also a
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
and the name is going to escape me at
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
it's a broader Association that is
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
includes a lot of Industry groups and
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
Scott Castle do you know the name
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
no it's a it's it's actually focused
 
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
specifically on producer responsibility
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
I just can't remember the name of it so
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes there are a few
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
organizations in that category and I'll
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
also note just because I think it's it's
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
relevant you know obviously pfas is
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
something that is on the minds of a lot
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
of people right now and um I recently I
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
attended in September our quarterly
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
board meeting for numoa and the board at
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
that meeting agreed to authorize numoa
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the Moa staff to begin working on a
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
Model legislation for pfas epr and and
 
00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
so that's something that
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
um you know it's going to take some time
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
but that's the kind of thing that really
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
can be helpful one of the one of the
 
00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
problems that is a problem for States
 
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
because it you know if every state
 
00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:29.579 align:start position:0%
develops a somewhat unique epr law for a
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
particular material
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
um and then they have to go and
 
00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:35.579 align:start position:0%
Implement that it can be pretty
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
um just in terms of on on the agency
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
when it comes time to launch something
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
like that it can have an impact you need
 
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
staff to do that you need it could be a
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
lot of work up front to set up something
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
like that and one of the things that has
 
00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
happened over the years and it's true
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
with that mercury example I gave you is
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
that when the northeast states agree on
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
model legislation that's going to be
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
implemented across the region or in some
 
00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
cases across the country then you can
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
start to get
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
um sort of economies of scale you don't
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
you don't have to each state doesn't
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
have to invent their own program and a
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
lot of these epr programs require some
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
kind of notification and record keeping
 
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
that can be very costly and time
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
consuming for individual states and one
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the things that is likely to happen
 
00:55:22.569 --> 00:55:22.579 align:start position:0%
they're going to look at models such as
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
there's another organization I hate to
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
keep hitting you with acronyms but
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
called ic2 which is the Interstate
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
Chemicals Clearinghouse and that is a
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
National Organization doesn't have full
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
membership across the states but has a
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
number of northeast states and States
 
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
across the country that have extended
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility and toxics and
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
packaging laws associated with
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
particular containments in packaging or
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
in products and the idea is that this
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
model legislation that pneumo will work
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
on along with the Northeast Recycling
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
Council that we're going to be working
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
in tandem went down will actually try to
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
be modeled after what we did with the
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
Mercury program and it would ideally set
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
up a system where the ic2 the Interstate
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
Chemicals Clearinghouse which has a lot
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
of infrastructure for collecting
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
information and receiving reports from
 
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:17.829 align:start position:0%
information and receiving reports from
manufacturers

00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
that could set up you know that I can
 
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
Envision and what we're expecting is
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
that legislation would set up a system
 
00:56:24.599 --> 00:56:25.849 align:start position:0%
that legislation would set up a system
where

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire and other states adopt
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
a law that that provides for pfas and
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
packaging or P fast and products uh
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility all the
 
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
manufacturers could report directly to
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
the ic2 group and they would cover their
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements for all the
 
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:43.380 align:start position:0%
states that were members instead of
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
having to report to each individual
 
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:47.339 align:start position:0%
State and having to develop a separate
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
reporting format so instead of having
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
this Mosaic of laws that become very
 
00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
difficult for uh industry and and
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
business to comply with which also makes
 
00:56:59.870 --> 00:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
it hard to pass those laws in the
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislature you have a system that's
 
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
much more attractive if you talk to any
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
member of Industry that's facing some
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a law that will require them to
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
either get something out of their
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
product or report about it they'll
 
00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
always tell you the first and foremost
 
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
thing they're most concerned about is
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
having a 50-state mosaic of laws they
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
have to comply with and if they've got
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
something that's uniform across at least
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
a region or the nation it's much more
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
attractive it's much easier easier to
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
get industry on board with that and then
 
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:31.380 align:start position:0%
Caesar to pass those laws and get them
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
implemented and once you do pass them
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
it's much easier on the individual
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
states for implementation because
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
they're not all individually standing up
 
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
these individual infrastructures for
 
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
managing the reporting and the
 
00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:45.710 align:start position:0%
managing the reporting and the
regulation

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
thing that we might be able to have some
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
discussions among ourselves so go ahead
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
I was just going to comment based off
 
00:57:58.970 --> 00:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
what you're saying that that's kind of
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
to the point where I was trying to go
 
00:58:02.569 --> 00:58:02.579 align:start position:0%
with if we do have some things to look
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
at in Maine right now doesn't that give
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
us a leg up on a lot of our
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
our our Research into this absolutely I
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
will say that anything that New
 
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des has ever done successfully
 
00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
when it comes to a new initiative we've
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
always learned a lot from other states
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
that have unless we're doing it unless
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
we're the first ones there's almost
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
always somebody who's done what you're
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
trying to do we always go to that and
 
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
so with
 
00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
with it we have I I think you sort of
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
helped clarify some things for me with
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
the um with mentioning namoa and ic2 I
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
think that there are
 
00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
a broad range of scenarios that need to
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
be looked at with regard to epr and I
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
think that it is important that we get
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
it right we're hearing from many
 
00:58:57.530 --> 00:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
stakeholders who are here today as well
 
00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:00.299 align:start position:0%
as in the previous in previous uh with
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative partials
 
00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.589 align:start position:0%
representative partials
um

00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
initial presentation of the bill with to
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
our committee that perhaps we we need to
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
continue to have this conversation and
 
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
though we can't make a recommendation
 
00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
today because there is not a quorum I
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
would like to schedule we have a
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
deadline for the committee I know we're
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
meeting again October 25th as a full
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
committee so I can certainly schedule
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
something between now and then to make a
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee and
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
I would like to do that I think it's
 
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
important that we have that opportunity
 
00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.390 align:start position:0%
important that we have that opportunity
to

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.410 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
through the appropriate venue do that so
 
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
there there will be no recommendation
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
made today and with that
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I thank you for your time and your
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
attention and I think
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
um that we can all agree that there's a
