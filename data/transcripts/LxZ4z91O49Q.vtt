say we also all represent people all
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
across the granite state because um uh
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
because the issues that come before this
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
committee have statewide impact on uh on
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
all Granite Staters and uh and I know
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
we're always trying to do the best thing
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
for um uh for for everybody together so
 
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
so um anyway I'm here this morning to
 
00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 402 with which is
 
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
relative to liability um as taxable
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
income of Education Freedom account
 
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
payments so uh we've talked a lot about
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
putting guard rails on the state's
 
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
relatively new uh education Freedom
 
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
account uh program the governor even
 
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned support for things that would
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
strengthen the program during her
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
inaugural address and that's what we've
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
been talking about too things like fraud
 
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
prevention things like eligibility
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
requirements things like Criminal
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
history background checks for service
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
providers things like accountability how
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
well do we know um how do we know how
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
well the kids are doing we just don't
 
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
know things like being subject to a
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
state performance audit how do we know
 
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
whether the program is performing
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
according to the law we just don't know
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
but unlike these guard rails to
 
00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
strengthen the program House Bill 402 is
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
more about being truthful honest to
 
00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who are
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
taxed to pay for the voucher program and
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
honest to families who participate in
 
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
the voucher program it's simple it
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
repeals the one line in RSA 194 Fon 2
 
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
Roman 6 that reads quote funds deposited
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
in an EFA shall not constitute taxable
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
income to the parent or the EFA
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
student so let's hold on for a second is
 
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently saying in state
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
law that EFA funds are not subject to
 
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
federal taxes
 
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
so let's be clear I'm not here to say
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
that EFA payments are subject to federal
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
tax or exempt from federal tax I'll say
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
it again I'm not saying that EFA
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
payments are or aren't considered to be
 
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
taxable income by the IRS in fact the
 
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
IRS has a web page titled do I include
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
my scholarship fellowship or education
 
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
grant as income on my tax return they've
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
got a website on this and it includes a
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
tool to determine whether these EFA
 
00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 align:start position:0%
payments are taxable in any case it's
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
not our role at the state level to
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
determine what is or isn't taxable under
 
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
federal law and more to the point we
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
should not provide bad information to
 
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
our constituents when it comes to
 
00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
federal tax liabilities that's both
 
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
misleading and
 
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
deceptive so what what's going on at the
 
00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
federal level so Senator Ted Cruz of
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
Texas actually filed legislation in past
 
00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
sessions of Congress to amend the
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
federal tax code to make education
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts free of federal tax
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
liability to the student and to the
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
family so straight from that uh Senator
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
Cruz's bill it reads quote not treated
 
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
as income the amount of any such
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship shall not be treated as
 
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
income to the student or their parents
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
for purpos of federal tax laws or for
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
determining eligibility for any other
 
00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 align:start position:0%
Federal program and you can actually
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
find this on page nine of Senator Cruz's
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
bill but that legislation failed so
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
what's this all mean
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
well maybe it means that EA EFA payments
 
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
are taxable at the federal level I mean
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
why else would Senator Cruz have filed
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
legislation so tax law is really
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
complicated I I know you guys know that
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
I don't have to say that in the ways of
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
Means Committee I'm on the education
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
committee um but as an engineer I I can
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
I can attest to that
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
too uh I don't have an llm in tax and I
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
don't have the tax chops to get into the
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
weeds of the federal tax code but as a
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I know that some income is
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
taxable and I know that some expenses
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
can be deducted from certain income for
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
example a 529 distribution used for
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
tuition has no tax liability but a 529
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
distribution used to buy a laptop might
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
be subject to federal
 
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
tax so what's this all mean it means we
 
00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
should recommend this bill isad to pass
 
00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:25.879 align:start position:0%
so that we're not providing misleading
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
or deceiving um information to uh EFA
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
families when it comes to the tax
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
liability that may be incurred or maybe
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
we should amend this and recommend it
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended so it's not
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
misleading and at least let these
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
families understand their federal tax
 
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
liabilities and let taxpayers know how
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
efficiently their money is being used
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
for a public benefit program like our
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
school Voucher Program passing this bill
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
is honest transparent and responsible to
 
00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:55.959 align:start position:0%
voucher families and to taxpayers and
 
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we should do I'm happy to
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
take some questions uh I I know there's
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
some experts um uh sitting behind me
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
that can can take very technical
 
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
y thank you representative for taking my
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
question uh regarding this particular
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm sing you like like I received
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
1099s corre
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
before however the money my
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of the current EFA
 
00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
situation is that's already
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
been accounted for as either taxable
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
income or tax exempt income is that your
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
understanding as well my yeah my my
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
understanding um and this this is is
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
only based on the uh the technical
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
advisory that uh that the IRS has
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
prepared the one that I that I talked
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
about that that some things uh some
 
00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
scholarhip um money is would not be
 
00:09:59.590 --> 00:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
subject to federal income tax if you Us
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
in certain ways but other scholarship
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
money um would be subject to federal
 
00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
income tax if used for certain things so
 
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
so it's just it's it's it's different
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
all understood and if there's subtleties
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
as to where the revenue is
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
originated uh can may I use the analogy
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
that this appears to be a 10 pound pound
 
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.870 align:start position:0%
that this appears to be a 10 pound pound
Sledge

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
Sledge
 
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
when a finish Hammer may be necessary um
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
and and and I I appreciate that um that
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
that that point representative vior and
 
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
and um and like like I said I I I I
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
think you know this committee could
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
certainly um you know see to it to make
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
our laws not misleading or deceptive to
 
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
to families um so that they can consider
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not their pay whether or not
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
payments Direct Ed by them um through
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship fund to
 
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
service providers are or are not subject
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
to uh federal income tax the um there
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
there is a section in the in the
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that um that that calls for
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
1099s uh when uh when I I started a tech
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
company many years ago and I know there
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
was a period of time where uh where
 
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680 align:start position:0%
where where our company needed to
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
provide 1099s to uh to various Supply
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
suppliers that were over a certain
 
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
amount I'm not sure where that law
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
stands today uh but but certainly that
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
could be something that could be pulled
 
00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:40.839 align:start position:0%
out of this this bill and and make it
 
00:11:43.949 --> 00:11:43.959 align:start position:0%
really just uh just clear to um uh to
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
families that uh that they need to work
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
with with their advisors in terms of
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
what's taxable and what's
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
not thank you you're welcome
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
question can you or maybe somebody else
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
give us an example of what you would
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
describe as
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
misleading in in something an example of
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
what uh this might be to help sure um
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
where where the where the misleading
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
part is in
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
is in the in our current
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
law and our current statute for efas in
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
194f there is
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
a there is a a a
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
sentence and I referenced it yeah in
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
194f Colon 2 uh Roman 6 that reads quote
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
funds deposited in an EFA shall not
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
constitute taxable income to the parent
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
or the EFA student my understanding is
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
is that I mean clearly New Hampshire
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an income tax so and New
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could set its own tax policy
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
with respect to New Hampshire taxes but
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
this doesn't talk about whether it's a
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
state tax or federal tax taxable income
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
well we certainly don't have that in New
 
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I'm assuming this would
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
mean this would lead me to believe it's
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
talking about federal tax liability and
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and as a state I don't think we're in
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
a position to determine what what
 
00:13:30.269 --> 00:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
constitutes federal tax Li ability so
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's that that's really the subject of
 
00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
of this bill um is uh is eliminating
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative so just to be clear
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
representative um as some people have
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
asked me about this legislation this is
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
not an attempt to impose a tax on
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
efas this is simply to say that under
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
federal tax law
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
which I'm certainly not qualified to
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
describe at the moment either but under
 
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
federal tax law certain kinds of
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures from the EFA fund could be
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
potentially taxable is that that's
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's correct and and and you know
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
there was there was some uh
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
very poor um uh journalism uh uh maybe a
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
couple months ago that that sort of
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
alleged that that this was the state of
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire looking to impose a tax on
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
voucher payments no this is not about
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
that at all I mean it was a um uh
 
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
obviously it it it it contained that
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
that story um contained some really
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
really wild wildly incorrect uh uh
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
statements including statements from the
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education that suggested
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
that the state maybe should tax you know
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
the per pupil amount that get sent to
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
public school districts so so uh should
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
tax students for that which which you
 
00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:17.759 align:start position:0%
know it just it it just clearly showed
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
that uh that the the people who were
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
making these statements hadn't even read
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
the bill so um so but thank thank you
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
very much for thank you thank you Mr
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.629 align:start position:0%
I guess I have one question

state has no jurisdiction over has there
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
been any court cases regarding this as
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
of serving on the house education
 
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
committee and was immersed in uh a lot
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
of the education funding bills and I'm
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
happy to report that 20 plus years later
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
we target money to communities we use an
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant to do it and we
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
meet our constitutional obligation uh by
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
funding the cost of
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
adequacy um House Bill 40 402 should be
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
voted inexpedient to
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
legislate uh or amend it to include
 
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
taxation on all students who receive an
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant for attendance
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
in a government run school program the
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
equal protection Clause of the 14th
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the US Constitution states
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
that all people in similar situations
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
must be treated equally by the law this
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
bill is a violation of that by
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
separating out students who receive the
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
Constitutional obligation of adequacy
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%

program students in government run
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
schools receive the same Financial
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
benefit as the state pays directly for
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
the adequate education cost to
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
government run schools providing that
 
00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:18.069 align:start position:0%
government run schools providing that
Educational

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
Educational
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
Service this bill is a solution looking
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
problem we need to cut spending and find
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh resources for paying for
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
the cost of education we should not be
 
00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039 align:start position:0%
taxing spending programs that we are
 
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required to provide for
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
the cost of the opportunity for an
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
adequate education that's what our state
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
law says does anyone think taxing the
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
education trust fund will help pay for
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
the cost of providing for an adequate
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
education I that really concludes my my
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
statement but I I think there was I I I
 
00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.470 align:start position:0%
statement but I I think there was I I I
obviously

00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
think that this is a tax would create a
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
tax for taxpayers in New Hampshire um
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
just because we don't have an income tax
 
00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:08.919 align:start position:0%
I'm a self-employed businessman so I pay
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise and the business
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
profit tax and anyone situated like me
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
that receives this EFA program to their
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
students would then have to pay add that
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
to their state income which is an income
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
tax on llc's so this is clearly a tax on
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
anyone who owns their own small business
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a regressive tax uh
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
specifically targeting a program that
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
has wonderful benefits um I think this
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
is a great program it should continue to
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
be exempt from New Hampshire uh small
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
business taxes that are a form of income
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
tax and I hate to admit that in my no
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
income tax state of New Hampshire and my
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die beliefs but the reality
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
is if you change this legis this
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
language in this bill that anyone who's
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
self-employed would have to declare this
 
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
income on their state tax return and
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
they would be eligible to add that to
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
whatever their business Enterprise and
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
business profit tax obligations are I
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that we should tax education
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
funds I know there's some great
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
philosophical divides and I respect
 
00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
those in the the validity of the program
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
the the program I obviously believe in
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
it um but that that the idea of taxing
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
money from the education Trust fun I
 
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:31.240 align:start position:0%
hope no one in the Ways and Means
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
Committee would think that that's even
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
remotely a good idea this is a foolish
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
legislation and you should vote it itl
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
and I thank the committee for their
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
time thank you uh do we have any
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
you okay up next I have Stephen
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%

education Freedom accounts uh and uh uh
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
many of are assisting in in getting this
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
off the ground uh right for back from
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
2011 or 12 when Tom deblo and the state
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
senate first uh proposed this type of a
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
thing um we've uh looked at this uh and
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
and we basically feel that this
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
particular bill is a is a bill in search
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
of a problem that doesn't exist uh first
 
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
of all uh representative uh was it Luna
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
Luna uh didn't didn't mention Pub 970 uh
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
IRS Pub 970 which basically exempts uh
 
00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to just read you the
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
specific language uh the value of you
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
know a fellowship Grant or scholarship
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
that is provided to an individual uh is
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
excluded from income the value of
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
contributed services and accommodations
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
this includes services and
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
accommodations such as room lodging
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
boards meals uh that are received by an
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
individual as part of a scholarship or
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
Fellowship Grant the amount of tuition
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
matriculation and other fees that are
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
paid for remitted to the student to Aid
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
the student in pursuing the study or
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
research and any amount uh received in
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
the nature of a family allowance as part
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
of a scholarship or Fellowship Grant
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's all right out of Pub five uh Pub
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
970 IRS uh nobody I don't know any
 
00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
accountant across the country that would
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
ever assume this to be taxable income uh
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
the the Ted Cruz bill was merely to make
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely certain that nobody tried to
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
tax these things because there are
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
people out there that would read into
 
00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:00.039 align:start position:0%
things things that don't exist and and
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's just absolutely for clarification
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
second point I would make is does
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
anybody here know what the annual gift
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
tax exclusion is in in the for Federal
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
gift tax purposes this year it's
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
$199,000 all right in addition to that
 
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
you can make what are called exempt
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
gifts so a grandparent for example can
 
00:22:23.789 --> 00:22:23.799 align:start position:0%
pay tuition education fees uh cost room
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
and board for a student going to any
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
private or non-public institution and
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
that is an exempt gift so it could be
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
$57,000 to go to Union College it could
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
be uh to go to a high school all right
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
well basically the rich can do
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
this but if what we're doing is we're
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
setting it up a potential for taxation
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
for the rank and file for for low low
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
income or moderate income people why
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
would we do that you're hurting the very
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
people that need this the most it makes
 
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:02.600 align:start position:0%
no sense and so my point is don't even
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
consider this leave it let the Sleeping
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
Dog lie this is as far as the federal
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
government Pub 970 is concerned as far
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
as us as tax preparers who have been
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with clients you know we we have
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
1,200 in our tax business uh we've never
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
ever uh you know included any of this as
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
as taxable income so that's my point
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%

to prepare and send out for each one of
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
the individuals who receives uh an
 
00:24:34.679 --> 00:24:37.149 align:start position:0%
the individuals who receives uh an
EFA

00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
EFA
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
form 1099 form well if they all of a
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
sudden have to start doing a tax return
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
because of this particular
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
income whatever you know whoever does
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
their tax returns if they did it on
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
Turbo Tax it' be one thing if they did
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
it uh through an accounting firm like
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
ours our minimum fee is 250 but yeah
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
that's not exactly what I'm asking to
 
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
prepare and send out the 1099 oh that's
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
a another uh thing on behalf of the
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh dispersing agent would would it's
 
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
going to cost them typically you know
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
for us to send out 1099s for some of our
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
client business owners it we're charging
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
$100 because a 1096 has got to go to the
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
IRS and then another $35 per $199 that
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
we have to send out so it depends on how
 
00:25:31.389 --> 00:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
many they're sending out so if you have
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
an organization like here in New
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have children's scholarship
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
fund and I don't know how many
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
recipients they have be 2,000 figure the
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
cost the time the postage of getting all
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
all of those out could be substantial
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
and it significantly adds to their
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
administrative cost thank you sir I
 
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.789 align:start position:0%

in my role as uh in my personal role um
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
I had the pleasure of serving on this
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
Committee in 1980 to 82 when I was a
 
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
student at University of New Hampshire
 
00:27:03.389 --> 00:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
um that started my love of tax policy
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
and tax law I went to Washington for a
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
few years and then came home to New
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where I raised my family and
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
I've worked as a tax lawyer since that
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
original introduction to tax law on this
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh in in 1980 um I also
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
recently had the pleasure of being
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
appointed by Governor sonunu to the 2020
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
education funding study committee and I
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to serve with
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative luno representative Ames
 
00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
and many other folks representative lad
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
on that committee during that effort we
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the entire scope of New
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public school funding system
 
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
not only the traditional system for
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
150,000 plus students but also um uh
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account which is up to
 
00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
around 5700 students now so I would like
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
to comment in support of the key part of
 
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill 402 which would repeal the
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
section that representative luno said
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
which says that the education funding
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
account payments are not taxable income
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
to the parent or the families I believe
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
that is inaccurate as a matter of
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
federal tax law and I'll walk you
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
through why uh here in a minute and I
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire should not
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
put what could be viewed as tax advice
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
into a statute and that tax advice could
 
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.430 align:start position:0%
into a statute and that tax advice could
be

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
wrong and someone could rely on it and
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
suffer consequences so if I could please
 
00:28:51.789 --> 00:28:51.799 align:start position:0%
just uh I do have on page three of the
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
report before you a a brief summary of
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire EFA program I'm not
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
going to focus on that but what it does
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
do is it has the state funding payments
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
oh uh uh to the scholarship organization
 
00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:09.799 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship fund which is
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
the administrator and they provide
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
payments to the education service
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
providers who are uh previously
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
registered for the benefit of specific
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
students eligible students who are
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
designated by the state of New Hampshire
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
that's our program on page four uh I
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
Focus exactly on the statutory section
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
in the bill the 194 F2 funds deposited
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
in an EFA shall not constitute taxable
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
income to the parent or the EFA student
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
that statement is incorrect and state
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
law has no power to change the effect of
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
federal tax law I would like to turn
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
next on page five to the actual section
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
of the Internal Revenue code that
 
00:29:58.269 --> 00:29:58.279 align:start position:0%
governs the taxability for f federal
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
income tax purposes of scholarship
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
payments that section is section
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
117 of the Internal Revenue code that
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
section says that if you receive certain
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
payments qualified scholarships and the
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
amount is used for qualified tuition and
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
related expenses that that payment is
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
exempt from federal income tax so there
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
are payments that are scholar ship that
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
are not taxable under federal law what
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
are those well first tuition and
 
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
fees um that are uh for the purpose of
 
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
the Stu enrollment or attendance of a
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
student at an educational organization
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's a defined term and fees books
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
supplies and equipment required by
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
courses at that educational institution
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
an educational organization is defined
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
as as an entity
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
um that is normally maintains a regular
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
facility and curriculum normally has a
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
regularly enrolled body of pupils or
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
students at the place where its
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
educational activities are regularly
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
carried on this is what you would think
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
of as the traditional Paradigm of a
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship payment it's something that
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
has gone to help people attend you know
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire or or or
 
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
something like that that's the
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
traditional it is this is a longstanding
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
section of the code and it is well
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
established on page six um our my my
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
prior colleague who testified talked
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
about a general publication 970 which
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
applies to all income the IRS has issued
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
a publication uh specifically on
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
scholarships fellowships and other
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
grants and they say exactly what's
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
tax-free and exactly what's taxable
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
amounts used for incidental expenses
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
such as room and board travel optional
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
equipment payments receed for teaching
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
research and other services as a
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
condition for the grant these other
 
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
expenses are taxable but a pure uh
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for tuition at a regular
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
school uh with a regular student body
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
and a regular curriculum those are
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
exempt uh from taxation under the
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
federal income tax law
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
um I we've noted some on page seven some
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
of the federal legislation this issue is
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
an issue in Washington there there are
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
several bills in addition to Senator
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
Cruz's bill there's other bills like
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
house uh uh HR uh
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
9462 that would seek to expand section
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
117 to include things like online
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
educational material costs college
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
application test costs educational
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
therapies for students with special
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
needs provided by accredited
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
practitioners and similar homeschool
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
costs importantly under current federal
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
income tax law costs associated with
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
homeschooling that you receive a payment
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
for those are not exempt from federal
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
income taxation as a scholarship payment
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
um if we get to the next section this is
 
00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
where the this is the clear example
 
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
representative ol and I I think
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy in RS in the EFA
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
statute there's a list of expenditures
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
that are covered that are eligible under
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
the EFA program those go through a
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph a through o on this one page
 
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
taking risks with how complicated the
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
federal income tax laws are I have made
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
an attempt to show the uh issues that
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
this bill supposed to address of the two
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
of the entire list a through o only two
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
paragraphs are likely not taxable and I
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
would say likely because the facts of
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
every case matter uh paragraph a tuition
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
and fees at a private school those
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
should be uh eligible for exemption
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
under Section 117 of the code in
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
addition if you go down to m m is the
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
traditional paradigm uh tuition and fees
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
and an institution of higher education
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
those should be exempt from federal
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
income tax law if you look at every
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
other item in the list of eligible
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
expenses for the EFA program there are
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
questions about whether those payments
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
would be taxable under the federal
 
00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
income tax law some of them that I
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
marked in red absolutely
 
00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
taxable and uh recipients who receive
 
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
for example tutoring Services provided
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
by an individual or a t tutoring
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
facility there are actual guidance out
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
there those are
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
not uh tax exempt um scholarship
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
payments they are not and if you look at
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
other ones for example educational
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
software and applications unless those
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
are mandated by a regular school with a
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
regular student body with a regular um
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh group of students
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
they they are not exempt from federal
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
income tax so of all of these payments
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
that are indicated under the EFA program
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
that are eligible there are significant
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
parts of that that are not eligible for
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship exemption treatment if we go
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
to uh the problem is page nine here's
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
the problem of
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
misleading I was not that worried about
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
this when this issue first came up with
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
the original EFA because the EFA Pro
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
program was limited to very very lwi
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
income people and in many cases you only
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
have to file if like married filing
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
jointly you you only have to file a tax
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
return if your gross income is over
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
around 30,000 so under the original
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
versions of the EFA program which were
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
focused on low income it was kind of
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
like a no harm no foul many of the
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
recipients aren't filing tax returns so
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
failure to declare these payments as
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
taxable income if they are wouldn't
 
00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:34.599 align:start position:0%
expose them to violating federal tax law
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
however uh it it there you know when if
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
you look at the next page 10 the federal
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
poverty level times
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
350% we're up to a family of four
 
00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:46.910 align:start position:0%
350% we're up to a family of four
earning

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
earning
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
109,000 that's guaranteed that family is
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
filing a federal income tax return if
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
that family of four receives $5,000 per
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
Stu per child and they do homeschooling
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
on an online program that isn't part of
 
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
it those amounts are taxable that would
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
be $220,000 that's roughly the average
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
that the based on New Hampshire doe
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's a problem for the State of New
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this committee and this
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
legislature to say in a statute that the
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
amounts received under this program
 
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
shall not constitute taxable income that
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
potentially misleads a recipient to
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
thinking well I don't have to report
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
this on my federal tax return that is
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
wrong if we come to conclusions last two
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
pages and be happy to take question EFA
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
payments may be taxable income 194 F2
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
Roman 6 is inaccurate it should be
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
repealed HB 4022 seeks to avoid
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
misleading EFA families it seeks to
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
protect the state from possible lawsuits
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the future that they gave incorrect
 
00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.270 align:start position:0%
in the future that they gave incorrect
tax

00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
advice and it definitely as
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
representative luno says repealing this
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
section does not impose any new tax
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's a ridiculous characterization
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
that was in that journal article and and
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
I I was I was stunned that someone would
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
say that and then finally the final page
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
is just a reminder I have had the
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity over my Years in New
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to structure many programs
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
including the business Finance Authority
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
back in 91 and many many more I love
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
this state and my my key in structuring
 
00:38:38.839 --> 00:38:40.430 align:start position:0%
this state and my my key in structuring
programs

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
always do it with due diligence and make
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
sure that you're not you know making
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
unintentional payments of a stream
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
that's designed to benefit citizens of
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
this state families of this state that
 
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
were taking slices out unintentionally
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
and so if you look at you know the
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
current traditional structure is well
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
established when a kids go to a regular
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
public school they don't have any income
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
they're receiving Services it is not
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
taxable but in this more creative
 
00:39:14.349 --> 00:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
alternative program this effort at
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
reform there is a risk that you're
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
taking slices so your dollar of spending
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
that goes through the EFA Pro through
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
the public school program gets you a
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
dollar of services but a dollar of of
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
through the EFA program is being charged
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
the you know up to 10% cost by the
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
administrator and also potentially for a
 
00:39:40.589 --> 00:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
family of four you know at 350% of
 
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
poverty potentially costing 20% you know
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
rough tax rate federal income tax rate
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
that would mean you're getting 70 cents
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
of service and is it possible to
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
structure this program so that it
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have this risk yes but you'd
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
have to limit it to the clear categories
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
that are taxfree under federal income
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
tax law I'd be happy to take any
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
questions and I thank this committee for
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
its work thank you representative
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
YY good to see you again thank
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
ones um
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
firstly I pay taxes for my local school
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
if I were to give money to private
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
school in town why can't I take that off
 
00:40:35.829 --> 00:40:35.839 align:start position:0%
as a expense as well the answer to that
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
is if the private school has gone
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
through the effort of qualifying as a
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
501c3 organization and many of them have
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
they would be a charitable organization
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
under 513 and under Section 170 your
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
contribution to that school would be uh
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
um tax deductible with one exception
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
representative over if you give the
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
money to the school and you say strings
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
attached I want that money I gave to the
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
school to benefit my kid on a
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship that would not be deductible
 
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
and that would um that they that would
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
not qualify there's clear law on that so
 
00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
designate the the charitable deduction
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
for a particular
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
student po thank you okay
 
00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
I understand that
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to synthesize you've
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
worked with the
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
legislature got to get this down to one
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
page yes got to get it down to one
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph correct New Hampshire cannot
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
set federal law requirements correct
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
easy easy that's exactly
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
right New Hampshire can is uh set limits
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
on what it considers taxable income
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely no we do not have an income
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
tax absolutely
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
right and the ruling I think your your
 
00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
key phrase in here this was an issue for
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
and from Washington to handle uh if the
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
federal income tax law has a question it
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
is for it only Congress and Washington
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
can fix
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
it but at the same time the current EFA
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be modified in certain
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
areas so it's not the terminology of
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
taxable income is not
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
misleading uh regarding the federal
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
obligation that may or may not
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
exist correct only each family that
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
receives the benefit of the EFA payment
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
can make the decision on their tax
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
return whether it is taxable or not it
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
would be kind of an easy thing if if I
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
believe this Paradigm case if an EFA
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
payment is made to to the scholarship
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
organization and then paid to a one a
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
501c3 uh religious school let's say like
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
a a traditional catholic school in town
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
here for example and that covers tuition
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
costs of attending that is exempt from
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
tax under Section 117 I can say that
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
with a with with a Clarity because it's
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what the law is in
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
Washington and the federal law is
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
intending to exempt but if it gets into
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
things like a payment where the family
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh purchases internet
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
connectivity or or uh uh SAT test prep
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
cost those things are taxable only the
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
so the caveat is caveat
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
empor well let let me just say this
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
caveat empor is not what this sentence
 
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
does the sentence that's in the law
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
right now has the situation where
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
someone goes hey uh I'm filing out like
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
uh doing it myself on on uh on turboxs
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to declare this 20,000 for
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
the four kids that are being home
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
schooled cuz the state statute says it
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to rely on that and then
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden let's say they get
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
audited not a common occurrence but
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
let's say they do and the auditor says
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
you should have reported this did you
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
intentionally not report it and all of a
 
00:44:43.549 --> 00:44:43.559 align:start position:0%
sudden that family is in a world of pain
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
they've got potential civil penalties
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
there's potential criminal penalties and
 
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden that family gets all up
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
in arms says I've had to hire a lawyer
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
stinking lawyer cost me a bunch of money
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to sue the state to reimburse
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
me for misleading me that's where it can
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
bite so Caveat Emptor is if you leave it
 
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
blank and you don't speak one way or
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
another I think the state has properly
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
left it in a caveat empor state but if
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
you have this sentence in the law you're
 
00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
tipping the balance where you're biting
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
on a risk which is potentially
 
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
misleading a family well you don't have
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
to the state doesn't have to speak on
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
the taxability federal taxability you
 
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.470 align:start position:0%
the taxability federal taxability you
can't

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
and just to the
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
merits both all the people who testified
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
are right this program is a program you
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
know has been around in places like
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
Milwaukee where the Public School
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
Systems have clearly failed in
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
Washington DC where they clearly failed
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
voucher programs are important uh
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
avenues for reform in the right place on
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
our education funding committee study
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee we found out that New
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public school system which
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
educates about over 150,000 students
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
every year is in the top 10 in terms of
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
quality of outcome and top 10 of
 
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
supporting Public Schools our public
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
school systems are working based on our
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
study and there is a real question to
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
get this program right don't make foot
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
faults you can make this program right
 
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
you just got to think about it and be
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
direct about your your knowledge on the
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
applicable law and risks representative
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
ducet thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
question excuse
 
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.829 align:start position:0%
question excuse
me

00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so in in your testimony can we
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
agree and I was a little confused with
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
something you said and maybe you can
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
just answer this for me the the
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
recipients or the benefactors of DFA
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
programs do they get those funds in hand
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
they do not get those funds in hand okay
 
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
so if they do it's a
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
violation exactly to my point um those
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
funds are distributed to Providers
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
correct so I guess my question to you is
 
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
how is it that a lowincome family that
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
derives a benefit from an
 
00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
EFA with a benefit that they've never
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
seen in hand comes up with the money to
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
pay what you believe is a taxable
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
component we you know they're applying
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
for and
 
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
benefiting with the efas but all of a
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
sudden they have to pay out of pocket
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
for a tax on a dollar that they didn't
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
put in their pocket representative I
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
think it's a great question so think of
 
00:47:43.839 --> 00:47:45.109 align:start position:0%
think it's a great question so think of
the

00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
traditional scholarship payment kid uh
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
goes to Claremont Stevens High School
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
like me and my wife we I met her there
 
00:47:57.549 --> 00:47:57.559 align:start position:0%
uh and the the uh
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
kid applies for scholarship the
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
organization grants a scholarship the
 
00:48:04.589 --> 00:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
organization pays the amount to the
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire for the
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
benefit of this child or this student at
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
that point and it it reduces the cost to
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
that student of the uh tuition for UNH
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
in that case the dollar has never hit
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
the student
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
pocket and the law says in that
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
situation that flow of benefit the
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
student clearly benefit didn't put cash
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
in the pocket and then transfer it to
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
the to the uh school but the the the kid
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
benefited in that case it says in
 
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
general all income is subject to tax and
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
that includes benefits like that but in
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
this specific case the IRS code the
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code says that
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship payment to UNH is not
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
reportable as taxable income by the kid
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
this situation if we had a situation at
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
the federal level where you had a
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
student apply for a scholarship and they
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
paid the money to a tutoring firm it was
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
not required by un and that tutoring
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
firm provided the service for the
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of that student that would be
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
taxable under Section 117 even though
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
the cash didn't hit the kids pocket when
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
then he paid to the student to to
 
00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
Tutoring company it in other words
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works for federal tax
 
00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
law follow up I I appreciate your your
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%
position on that but we're talking about
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh optional Post Post Elementary
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
education here to to apples and
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
oranges you know you you're giving me an
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
example about University components
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about through 12
 
00:49:59.789 --> 00:49:59.799 align:start position:0%
representative that is required I can I
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
used it because that's the Paradigm I
 
00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
can change it to uh a private school
 
00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:09.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship to a private k212 school
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
exact same
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
treatment no difference under federal
 
00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.349 align:start position:0%
treatment no difference under federal
tax

00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:16.839 align:start position:0%
law okay and and we can agree to
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
disagree and there's two two uh opinions
 
00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.030 align:start position:0%
disagree and there's two two uh opinions
on

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
this do you think that don't file a tax
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
return like that well no I just heard a
 
00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
tax attorney tell me that this is not
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
taxable and he would not file that so so
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
we have differing opinions I guess my
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
question to you is this can we excuse we
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
got have one person talking at a time
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
right now Sor should in your opinion the
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature get into
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
having voice in what is federal tax code
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
in our statute is that what you're
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting we should not say a thing
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
about federal tax law in our stat
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill does it's it
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
removes saying something about federal
 
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
tax law on our
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
statute and and how
 
00:51:10.349 --> 00:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
we no thank you okay U I've got a couple
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
more questions here but let me
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
um let me just ask
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
does the federal tax code uh or no does
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
federal law preempt state
 
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
law in
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
almost all
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
situations yes there is a supremacy
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
clause in our
 
00:51:39.549 --> 00:51:39.559 align:start position:0%
Constitution and they it so if Congress
 
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
enacts a law in a field of law like tax
 
00:51:48.349 --> 00:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
it it it is but in this case the tax
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
only sets the federal level of tax in
 
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:52.839 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
preemption the Congress has has passed
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
some laws that would preempt States from
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
imposing taxes on certain income uh so
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
they've done it there but it's it's a
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
complicated question yeah so um and is
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
ignorance of the law a a defense no it
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
is not okay so if somebody looks at this
 
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
and says oh I don't have to uh file but
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
they don't have the full picture they
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
didn't look at the federal law then
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
technically it does the state have
 
00:52:27.390 --> 00:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
liability because we all know federal
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
law preempts and you should have looked
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the federal law as well it it would
 
00:52:33.549 --> 00:52:33.559 align:start position:0%
be it it's kind of one I appreciate the
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
question uh Mr chairperson they the the
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
the question is the way I'm hearing you
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
frame it is hey we could leave this in
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
here because no one's going to actually
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
be able to ultimately sue us because we
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
weren't intentionally misleading them
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
and they were not they were making their
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
own decision but why would you have a
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
potentially incorrect statement in the
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
statute you could change it by saying
 
00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799 align:start position:0%
funds deposited in EFA shall not
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
constitute taxable income under any New
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh tax you could put that in
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
and that would be accurate because it's
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
definitely not income under the bet it's
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
that which I helped Governor
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
Merill write the BET back in 93 it it's
 
00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
definitely not taxable income under the
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
business profits act we don't have an
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
income tax of any other kind that would
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative duet um
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
actually I'm sorry let me well you kind
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
of a just along those lines you'd agree
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
with me that the the IRS has a
 
00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
robust uh compliance and auditing
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
system that they they follow so if
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's an
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
issue it's their horse to chase correct
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
they yeah absolutely thank you
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative om yeah thank you for
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
your uh summary of very complex tax laws
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
my question is has there been any
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
adjudication of the New Hampshire laws
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
either now that's been adjudicated or
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
pending representative moment it's great
 
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
to see you again uh no there has not to
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
my knowledge been any case addressing
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
remember what we see right now happening
 
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
across the country is the increasing
 
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
expansion of this
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
alternative uh Education Service
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
delivery regime vouchers or efas or
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you call them it's happening in
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
Arizona it's happening in Ohio happening
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
in Florida North Carolina and
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
potentially New Hampshire there have
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
been no cases representative home I
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
think principally because the scope of
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
the programs has been very narrow
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
limited to lowincome recipients who most
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
of the time are not required as you know
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
in in in in the United States 50% of the
 
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
you know filers don't pay any federal
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
income tax and and and so it's you know
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is I don't think it's
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
been a problem that has generated
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
litigation that's why the cases don't
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
exist however we're on the cusp of this
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
problem as the expand as my testimony
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
shows as the expansion is
 
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
happening representative Spar thank you
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um understand everything you've
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
done said so far uh the section that is
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
in the bill about uh issuing 1099 can
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
you just comment briefly on your
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
perspective of that yes I did read that
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not commenting on that my testimony
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
because I don't think that is quite
 
00:55:44.029 --> 00:55:44.039 align:start position:0%
correctly frame with due respect for the
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill uh the 1099 there is
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
no 1099 requirement right now for uh uh
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
the scholarship payments um and and and
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
the at at the federal level and we can't
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
say anything about as a state for the
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
same reason we can't say anything about
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
the taxability of these payments under
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
federal tax law we can't say anything
 
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
about the reportability of the amount
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
this issue has come up before in an
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
interesting Way section 529 of the
 
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code the college
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
Savings Plan account New Hampshire was
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
the first state in the country to
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
establish one of these plans the unique
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
plan Fidelity is the administrator I
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
represent Fidelity in that effort and we
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
got the first IRS letter ruling for any
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
state on that plan in that situation
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
Congress passed a law ordering the state
 
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
college Savings Plan programs to pay a
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
1099 to beneficiaries who receive
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
dispersements from the 5.9 plan without
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
that Federal enactment there would be a
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
no 1099 there is no 1099 requirement
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
under federal law so in my you've asked
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not focused on it I don't think that
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
section of this bill uh uh is is
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
accurately framed there may be something
 
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
about notice that's required that's a
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
decent discussion point but I'm not uh
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
commenting on
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Southworth and then
 
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
representative tney thank you Mr chair
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I part
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
one and part two on part one do New
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
eight page
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire CPA's uh do not do not
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
this page eight the first time it's seen
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
the light of day is to this committee
 
00:57:40.109 --> 00:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
okay so the New Hampshire CPAs however
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
have great access to the actual Internal
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue code all the regulations under
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
the Internal Revenue code and the
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
publication that directly applies to
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
scholarships and fellowship grants which
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
is the one that's cited in my t Okay
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
seems like again in the future maybe
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
they will need to um part two um I I
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
don't do it but are there sections on
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
turbo Cam that would lead someone to
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
know what qualified uh expenses were did
 
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:10.039 align:start position:0%
you mean Turbo Tax or Turbo Tax yeah I
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
have prepared my own personal tax return
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
on Turbo Tax I have never had to address
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
a scholarship payment and therefore I
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that so this is
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
very new basically for every I I think
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
these this the this type of question
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
coming up is new because this this
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
Pathway to Educational Service provision
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
is is is relatively new in New Hampshire
 
00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:39.079 align:start position:0%
we do 150,000 plus kids through the
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
traditional uh system of delivering
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
public education and only 5,000 plus
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
still uh representative tney thank you
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
question my grandson is in college yeah
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
and I know on his
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
taxes they're asking if he received any
 
00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
scholarships so some way shape or form
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
if that question is on his uh tax form
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
whether the individual be like that age
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
or a parent they'd have to answer it
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
correct yes if that and again sorry I
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
don't personally have experience with
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
that my grandchildren are seven and four
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
and one four of them so I have few years
 
00:59:39.069 --> 00:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
on you follow up follow up okay one
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
section in here under
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
194 talks about the parents of an EFA
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
student shall agree technically meaning
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
that they're getting the money if the
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
verbiage was changed to the student
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
receiving the money that would lower the
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
threshold of income tax that was
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
necessary unless the child was extremely
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
wealthy on its own correct it it's a
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
complicated question in this regard if
 
01:00:11.789 --> 01:00:11.799 align:start position:0%
this if the some kids were going to
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
college are still dependent on their
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
parents return and whether they're
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
filing their own individual return or
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
not depending on their income level but
 
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.710 align:start position:0%
not depending on their income level but
in

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
general if you could probably try and
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
structure it that way to reduce exposure
 
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
to having that child have to file a tax
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
return and and have the income be deemed
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
to be received by the child um it could
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
happen but that's complicated and and
 
01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
bottom line represent attorne it's based
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
on the facts of the particular case and
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire shouldn't say
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
anything about how they go to their Tax
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
Advisor and resolve these questions
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
their Tax Advisor should help them and
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
they should do it personally with look
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
at turbox thank
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
you um this is just maybe more your
 
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
personal opinion on um I I also use
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
Turbo Tax and um if if the example you
 
01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:11.039 align:start position:0%
gave where somebody goes and uses Turbo
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
Tax and they see this and they mess up
 
01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
and eventually they sue the state isn't
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
Turbo Tax the one that's
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
liable I I I again I think if Turbo Tax
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
gets something wrong
 
01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
they are potentially are negligent and
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
there could be potentially a claim
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
against them that's possibly true but if
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
the person says you know I read New
 
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's law it says it's not taxable
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
income I relied on that do I think that
 
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.039 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a large money risk to
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
the state like um the YDC cases or the
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
youth services cases that we're seeing
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
in the state right now no it's
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
definitely not there's 5,000 Plus
 
01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
uh families here
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I think representative luno
 
01:02:04.589 --> 01:02:04.599 align:start position:0%
deserves credit for raising a bill that
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
says why mislead potentially families
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
when we don't have to we're not
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
achieving anything with the sentence no
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
that that makes sense I guess my concern
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
is this has been in here for a long time
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
why is it in are we are we missing
 
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
something if we if we get rid of this
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
are we somehow creating some other
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
problem I think that's a fair question
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
let me say where I think this came from
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
I remember when the EFA thing came up
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
this sentence was in the statute at that
 
01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
point it was very very low income right
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
and and so I was kind of I just I love
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
the state I love this committee's work
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
and I pay attention right I I I've
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
always done that representative Aly
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
knows I've tortured this committee for
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
many many years and and um and and uh
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know I heard about this thing I said
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
well that's a crazy sentence what I
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
think happened is that in the Arizona
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
law there is a sentence like this in
 
01:03:08.829 --> 01:03:08.839 align:start position:0%
some of their
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
Publications I have I'm betting dollars
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
to Donuts I do not know this it's a
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
personal opinion represent G again that
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
someone who was drafting this just
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
simply copied it didn't really think
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
about it okay and and that is the source
 
01:03:28.349 --> 01:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
of it in that original hearing I heard
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
back from my wonderful colleagues that
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
um uh attorney uh Deputy assistant
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General an Edwards
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
who's now a judge on her Superior Court
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
she told the committee you can't do
 
01:03:46.029 --> 01:03:46.039 align:start position:0%
anything about federal tax law but it
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
still went in I I I don't believe
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
removing this is going to have any
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
adverse effect it's like a free one all
 
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
right thank you all right thank you very
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
much you very much okay that's all I
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
have for pink cards and uh we're only 32
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
minute all right representative AES okay
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
good good morning and uh I said put two
 
01:04:30.309 --> 01:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
minutes down on that card I think I can
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
keep it to one um I'm a co-sponsor of
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
this bill I
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
uh did I I co-sponsored because I think
 
01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
it's uh unwise for the state
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
to give advice as it's essentially doing
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
in this uh case on on federal tax law in
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
the absence
 
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
of clarity that simply does not exist in
 
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
this situation you've heard uh um Bill
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
aringer Mr aringer um who certainly
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
knows tax law tell you that uh there is
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh that this this statement that's in
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
our code is uh misleading I think it
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
should be either removed or
 
01:05:29.549 --> 01:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh amended revised so it's not
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
misleading anymore it's a simple matter
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
to do that either way and I encourage
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
you to do
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you all right and your idea
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
of amending it would be um not taxable
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire uh or not taxable in
 
01:05:45.039 --> 01:05:46.109 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire uh or not taxable in
New

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by New Hampshire by New
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
this bill is to improve the clarity and
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
relevance of financial reporting from
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit corporation that
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
administers the state's education tax
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
credit and education Freedom account
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
programs so the um uh the title of the
 
01:08:59.709 --> 01:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
bill cont only contains the um uh the
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
reference to the education tax credit
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
program and that's um that's
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
specifically because the administrator
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
of the program called the scholarship
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
organization is defined in RSA 77 colon
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
G1 uh which is actually the education
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
tax credit statute uh but that
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
organization also administers the
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account program and
 
01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
the IFA program statute in 194 uh- Fon
 
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
one uh defines the administration as
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
defined in 77g Back to the education tax
 
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
credit so that's sort of the Nexus of
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
how the the scholarship or a scholarship
 
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
organization administers both the
 
01:09:44.669 --> 01:09:44.679 align:start position:0%
education tax credit program it was
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
started there it was defined there and
 
01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
now also administers the education
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program um so when we
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
talk about this organization this is the
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
organization that's the contract ctor
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
that administers both the both the
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
programs I just talked about the ETC and
 
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
the EFA programs and retains up to 10%
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
of the funds uh used in these programs
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
including uh nearly $75 million of
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds appropriated in the state
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
budget over the first four years of the
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
um of the state's um um uh education
 
01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
Freedom account
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
program and while it's perfectly clear
 
01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
the money used uh for funding the
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
voucher program is taxpayer money there
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
is absolutely no doubt that the money
 
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
retained by the contractor for
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
administrative costs that 10% of the $75
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
million so far that money is taxpayer
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
money and part of the state contract
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
approved by the governor and executive
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
Council the children's scholarship fund
 
01:10:48.350 --> 01:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire posts the New York
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofits tax form 990 uh as its
 
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
audited financial report doesn't have
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
any independent audited financial report
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
or anything that's separated out from
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship fund uh
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
operating out of New York that um uh
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
that operates as a scholarship program
 
01:11:12.149 --> 01:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
for um uh for many other states so so
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
our um New Hampshire education Freedom
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
count program and education tax credit
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
program are buried in a national
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
organization's uh IRS form 990 which is
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
the uh uh tax form for um uh as you know
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
for organizations that are exempt from
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
income tax so the contractor that we're
 
01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:35.719 align:start position:0%
working with here in New Hampshire is
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
doing business as the children's
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund of New Hampshire but
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
it's actually not its own nonprofit
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
organization um and doing business as
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
instead doing business as part of a
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization based in New York
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
um uh that does work um uh in a bunch of
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
other states with 20 two uh partner
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
organizations who are also nonprofits
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
located in the I guess the 20 other
 
01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
states that they do business in and um
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
and and and what it does in those other
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
states or for those other states or with
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
those other states is very different
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
than what it does for uh for New
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through the ETC and EFA
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
programs so the way it's organized right
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
now raises a lot of questions why do all
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
the other states have their own
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
organizations nonprofit organizations
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in their states how do we
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
know if our taxpayer dollars are being
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
used to fund programs in other states
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
why is the New Hampshire Department of
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
Education so adamant to block the
 
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
state's audit of the voucher program
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
even when the contract itself between
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and the
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund is clear
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
that the state has ownership of all the
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
data that comes out a result of these
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
programs and so as a nonprofit
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
charitable organization it raises a lot
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
of questions too the children's
 
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund um New York is a
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization it receives
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
charitable contributions from people and
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
organizations all across the country and
 
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
identifies and selects applicants
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
students who are applying for
 
01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship from all around the country
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
scholarships from all around the country
 
01:13:16.639 --> 01:13:17.390 align:start position:0%
scholarships from all around the country
to

01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
receive this money the New Hampshire
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
voucher business is very different the
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
money comes from the state and the
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
recipients are defined by law and
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
administrative rules the recipients are
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
actually defined in RSA
 
01:13:35.229 --> 01:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
194f and the and the education rules
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
that correspond to that and they're not
 
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
subject to the discretion representative
 
01:13:42.189 --> 01:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
luno can I just ask you you put three
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
minutes down and you're at six minutes
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
how much more you have I'm really at the
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
end you're almost done yeah thank you
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair I'm sorry about that
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
so um so it's not subject to the
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
description of the contractor sounds
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
more like a service provider a
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
contractor that takes 10% off the top
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
for their administrative fee not a
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
charitable function simply
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
administrative so this bill would
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
require the contractor use to manage the
 
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
tax credit program and the voucher
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
program to be a New Hampshire company
 
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
and to file its own IRS forms um that
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
would clearly show how the taxpayer
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
money is being used it's about
 
01:14:16.629 --> 01:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
transparency it's about honesty and it's
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
about making sure our own nonprofits are
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations and not just
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
administrative service providers thank
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you and and if we weren't
 
01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:28.120 align:start position:0%
so far behind I would have let you keep
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
going just get no I I I I appreciate
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question did you
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
say we couldn't access an audit on this
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
so so there um there was state law that
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
was passed and signed by the
 
01:14:56.110 --> 01:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
governor two years ago maybe I don't I
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
don't have it in front of me that um
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
that that required the state actually
 
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
required the um the the the Auditors in
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget Assistance Office
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
to conduct a performance audit on the
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account program uh
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that uh is that the
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
the the audit scope uh has been uh
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
limited substantially to a point where
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
the information that the that the LBA
 
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
Auditors were looking for uh while the
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
information exists uh they were not
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
receiving access to that information and
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner of Education uh went
 
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
before the um the is it the joint
 
01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:39.159 align:start position:0%
committee on state audit is I think I'm
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
if that's not the title of the committee
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's close um and um and said
 
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that he would refuse to uh
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
information follow up I just thought
 
01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
your testimony was that I'm looking at
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
the annual audit on EFA accounts on
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
their website on the fact sheet so it it
 
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
is there for that that's not an LBA
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
performance audit that's um that that's
 
01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
simply the the um Department of
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
Education saying this number of students
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
received the these amounts of of um of
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
EFA um deposits and payments through
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
through those accounts and um and in
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
fact in a um in in what's called a
 
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
monitoring exercise that the Department
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
of Education conducted last summer on 50
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
efas 50 EFA accounts so that's 1% less
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
than 1% because I think there's north of
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
55200 EFA accounts but but in the in the
 
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring exercise on 50 EFA accounts
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
they found
 
01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
25% had um had had substantial um um
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies or non-compliances with
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
state law and state um regul on this
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
including students who were not eligible
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
to to receive these vouchers um uh
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
payments that that were not directed in
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
the in the right way and um and that the
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
um the children's scholarship fund did
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
make U restitution to uh to the state of
 
01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for um uh for the um the
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
the amounts of State money that were um
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
that were not approp that were
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
misappropriated but I have not heard
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
back from the I asked the department
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
whether whether they appli that to the
 
01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
the remaining
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
99% of the uh of the accounts but uh uh
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's no indication anything has
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
been done on that followup I guess my
 
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:39.560 align:start position:0%
question to you is I'm looking at it
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
right now you 50 applications were
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
viewed and two were
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
found ineligible how how does that
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
equate to
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
25% looks like the
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
$188,000 received were both were return
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
the if I'm reading this right but my
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
math isn't that good but two out of 50
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
is 25% so so so thank thank you for the
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
clarifying question uh what they what
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
they determined initially was that
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
25% and uh and then they drilled down
 
01:18:12.270 --> 01:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
into that and found that the children's
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund was not using the
 
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
proper information uh in determining
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
residents of the um of the um uh of the
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
students and um uh and and and once the
 
01:18:27.870 --> 01:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh once the proper information was used
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
they were able to address some of the
 
01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
non-compliances but other
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
non-compliances as the representative
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
outstanding represent
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
elme thank you um I don't know how many
 
01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
of us have seen charitable
 
01:18:51.629 --> 01:18:51.639 align:start position:0%
1099s um is it 1099 I 99 9.99 thank you
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
my my head is full of cold at this point
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
on on but they are available online
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
could we get a copy of the the new of
 
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
the New York State one that we are part
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
of see how it's
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
treated yeah yes you you can you can
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
online I guess as I read um the fiscal
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
note representative um the um it sounds
 
01:19:26.669 --> 01:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
to me like uh there's only one it looks
 
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
like there's only one chable
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
organization right now and if this bill
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
goes through it would be none would that
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
imply that that would effectively kill
 
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
the EFA program I'm sorry I'm I missed
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
oh the fiscal so in the fiscal note uh
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
when I read the first paragraph there
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
under methodology and it seems to imply
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
that there's only one charitable
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
organization that's uh valid in New
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's it is approved um and
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
your change to the bill where cross is
 
01:19:59.790 --> 01:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
out qualified to do business
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
um that would imply organization out of
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
state um it it sounds like that's the
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
only organization and if that goes away
 
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
then it would kill the EFA program and I
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly so um the
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is not to kill
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
the EFA program it's also not to kill
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
the children's scholarship fund of of
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
New York but it's simply that the
 
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund of New
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the the company that's doings
 
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
business as the children's scholarship
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
fund of New Hampshire should be
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the state of New
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a as a nonprofit um uh
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
entity just as um as these operating
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
entities exist in the 20 other states
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
that um that that provide these
 
01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
Services um I mean I I certainly
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind if it was incorporated in
 
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the problem would be
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
timing because if this bill goes through
 
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
it gets passed um the program is dead
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
until some somebody you know register so
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
I I guess yeah yeah I mean I think there
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
I think there is
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
um I think there is another uh nonprofit
 
01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
that uh that operates in New Hampshire
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
that that that does these I'm not sure
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
about the the name of that it's not the
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund but but if
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
the if the timing of this is the um is
 
01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
the problem then changing the uh the
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
effective date on this I think would uh
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
would make a lot of sense uh because it
 
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
does take some time right to to to apply
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
and get approved as a 501 that would be
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
my concern representative
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
duet would you agree would make sense
 
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
and it's my understanding um that the
 
01:21:37.149 --> 01:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund uses a
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
shared services model that keeps costs
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
down so why would why would it make a
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
difference where they're Incorporated if
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
they're delivering the service here and
 
01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
they're keeping the cost low if they're
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
in Maryland B you know based there what
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
what's the difference as long as they
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
complying with the statute and keeping
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
the cause now for us yeah I think it's
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
basically for transparency and when you
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
when you take a look at the um the 990
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
from the um from the children's
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund of New York you'll see
 
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
um uh that uh that the other states that
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
they do business with are very different
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
than how they're doing business in New
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in fact nearly 40% of their
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
program Revenue uh comes from the state
 
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire which is obviously not
 
01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
what they're doing
 
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
um in other states but but at the same
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
time they there's not that level of
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
detail in the in the 990 and um uh and
 
01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
and it's it's it's impossible to tell
 
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
from looking at the 990 that is working
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
with other partners in 20 other states
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
and working with New Hampshire uh how
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
they're you
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
know how how the the how New Hampshire's
 
01:22:55.149 --> 01:22:55.159 align:start position:0%
you know tax dollars are being used
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%

01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
Council in the Nights of Columbus each
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
one of them files their own
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
990 even though none of them right 501
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
C8 or threes 501
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
C8 within the state of New Hampshire as
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact they can't be because
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
of the franchise structure that was
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
alluded to by representative ducet
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
why would we treat this particular
 
01:24:02.189 --> 01:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
business any differently than already
 
01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
existing federal law
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
governing similar corporate
 
01:24:11.550 --> 01:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
structures and the amount of money that
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
the Knights of Columbus or the Masons or
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
handles it substantially larger than
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
anything that's the educational trust
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
fund is touching sure so so no I
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the the question and and
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
I think if the children's scholarship if
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
the company if the children's
 
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund of New Hampshire not
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
its own organization was filing their
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
own 990 as you've said the your your
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
organization the and the member
 
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state you said each
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
file their own
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
990 if the if children's scholarship
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
fund of New Hampshire was filing their
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
own 990 then then I think we'd have the
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh the visibility and transparency that
 
01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
we need but they're not filing their own
 
01:24:59.070 --> 01:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
990 unlike the 20 other states that that
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
are that are doing this so so um so
 
01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
potentially you've identified um you
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
know another way to to approach this
 
01:25:08.239 --> 01:25:10.510 align:start position:0%
know another way to to approach this
this

01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
problem representative
 
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
opal thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah I was reading a story that
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
admittedly was from September of of last
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
year in the conquered
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
monitor in which it said that um there
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
would finally be a performance audit of
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
the oversight of the education Freedom
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
account this coming
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
spring but then in the second paragraph
 
01:25:42.669 --> 01:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
it says but the audit will be missing
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
quote most documents pertaining to the
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
EFA program end quote due to the quote
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
lack of access to primary program data
 
01:25:52.950 --> 01:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
and information end quote according to
 
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
the office of the legislative budget
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
assistant which is responsible for
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
conducting the
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
audit um and you may not be able to
 
01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
answer this question but to your
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge has that statement changed has
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
there been a new finding from LBA that
 
01:26:13.109 --> 01:26:13.119 align:start position:0%
they will have access to that data um
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very very much for
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
the question um my understanding is is
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
goes right back to to to that and um and
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
that that access was being to to the LBA
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
felt they needed to properly conduct a
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
um a performance audit was they were not
 
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
being given access to the information
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
they felt that they needed that there
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
was a um uh a a revision made to what's
 
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
called audit scope so it was called
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
limiting the audit scope and that the
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
LBA will in fact conduct an audit
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
conduct an audit um uh corresponding to
 
01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
the new limited scope but uh but uh but
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
their answers to many questions that
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
come up in that audit will um will you
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
know basically have to say something to
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
the line of access to certain
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
information that's necessary for the you
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
know responsible um um you know
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
management of the program was uh was not
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
provided so so you know so I think you
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
know that that would lead someone to
 
01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:19.119 align:start position:0%
conclude that there were ineffective
 
01:27:19.119 --> 01:27:21.709 align:start position:0%
conclude that there were ineffective
management

01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
Campbell former
 
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
I'm thank you uh Packy Campbell former
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
rep and New Hampshire
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
businessman um I'm a I'm anque position
 
01:27:57.109 --> 01:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
in that um I've been able to through
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
some of my llc's actually donate to this
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
program and then uh due to my uh my uh
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
great business acun on some years was
 
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
not so great so I was actually eligible
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
for the program and I have one student
 
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
who's a senior in high school who is uh
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
receiving the EFA program and it helps
 
01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
my family tremendously to be able to
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
afford tuition in a private Catholic
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
School um that I I feel important um but
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
really I'm here today to ask you to find
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
this bill inexpedient to legislate um
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen this bill in years passed in
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
the policy committee um and I think it's
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's bad policy but it's also um the
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
bill is written is contrary to the
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
commers Clause that requires us to
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
recognize outof State organizations to
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
do business in New Hampshire we cannot
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
limit the rights of charitable
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
organizations to act as scholarship
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
organizations in New Hampshire would be
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
limiting the rights of them to register
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
which this this organization has done to
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
do business in New Hampshire and would
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
prevent them from preventing uh from
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
Distributing the education Freedom
 
01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
accounts this is just simply
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because it violates the
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause that we have to
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
recognize a New York charitable
 
01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
organization to do business in New
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we can't discriminate against
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
it we can't prevent them from the
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get this 10% funding fee
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's just simple Commerce and I agree
 
01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
with you they're being paid to do it and
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
then the Hampshire Branch does benefit
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
operationally from this 10% and um I
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
believe actually they run the
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
organization for less than the 10% of
 
01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
the 5800 students and they actually give
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh some of that 10% out as additional
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
scholarships which I think is amazing um
 
01:29:46.109 --> 01:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
the full faith in credit clause in the
 
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
US Constitution requires states to honor
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
the laws and judgments of other states
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
if another state set up a charitable
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
organization uh we need to recognize
 
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
that Char of organization when
 
01:29:57.550 --> 01:29:57.560 align:start position:0%
registered to do business in New
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to deny in any way the right
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
of a Char of organization because it was
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
formed in another state is a
 
01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.830 align:start position:0%
formed in another state is a
constitutional

01:30:06.830 --> 01:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
violation the equal protection Clause
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
again the 14th Amendment of the US
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution states that all people all
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
corporations similarly situated be
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
treated equally under the law any
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
nonprofit registered to do business in
 
01:30:24.109 --> 01:30:24.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can act as a scholarship
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
organization it doesn't matter if it was
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
set up originally decades ago in another
 
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
state it's set up in this state it's
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
registered of the Secretary of State
 
01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
website to do business in the state um
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
so given the tremendous constitutional
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the proposed Bill the
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
committee should vote itl on the
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
legislation better
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
yet due to the Constitutional violations
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
this proposal it is appropriate to send
 
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
this to Supreme Court to get an opinion
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
justices so we can get this repeat
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
poison pill proposal from continuing to
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
be a backdoor attack to hurt or
 
01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
eliminate the education Freedom account
 
01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
program in New Hampshire as a business
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
owner I appreciate being able to make
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
donations to a scholarship organization
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
registered to do business in New
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and the EFA is a brilliant
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
program because it allows to make a tax
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
deduction contribution federally
 
01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
lowering my federal tax obligation to a
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit and then that keeps the money
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for New Hampshire
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
students to use it this is you know if
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
you're on the ways of me many this is
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
the most wonderful thing we can do
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
instead of business owners sending money
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
to the federal government we're able to
 
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
send it to a nonprofit scholarship
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
organization so students in New
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can use it for educational
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
services so this is a very valid program
 
01:31:57.629 --> 01:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
that we should protect and Mr chairman
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
yes if you pass this legislation that's
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
rented it would effectively eliminate
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
the program I don't know if that's the
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
intent I'll take the representative at
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
his word but it is certainly the effect
 
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
if you pass this bill as written thank
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
you okay let U representative you
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
set thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
for your testimony in taking my question
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
I'm doing some digging as as we're
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony here uh and you
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
alluded to a 10% administrative cost
 
01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
would you believe and would you accept
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
7.9% administrative costs being a a
 
01:32:40.510 --> 01:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
pretty good deal I think that's an
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
excellent deal and I think it was
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
actually 7% in 2003 so I think it was a
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
little bit lower but I think they're
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
doing a tremendous job they're
 
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous organization the the fact
 
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
that they were formed in New York and
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that they run 22 other programs
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
that this was originally a program run
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire organization and they
 
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
merged with the children's scholarship
 
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
Network to get these efficiencies to
 
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
provide better services and they've done
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
that they're a well performing
 
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
organization to exclude them would be uh
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
travesty of
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
Justice repr
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
elmy thank you I find it extremely
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
difficult that New Hampshire has put
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
itself into the situation where it is
 
01:33:25.149 --> 01:33:25.159 align:start position:0%
the only one of
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
21 uh organizations under the New York
 
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
Group which um hides its own
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
information by leaving it only in New
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
York isn't there some kind of difficulty
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
with this and why would we be doing that
 
01:33:51.790 --> 01:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
when every other state organization
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
has has um as happens with all all other
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
sorts of nonprofit organizations every
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
other state has also put out
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
990s of its own representative I I
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
respectfully um do not buy the narrative
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
that this program is not very
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
transparent again as a a participant in
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
the program you're reimbursed up to the
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant so I know
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
there's 5,800 kids in the program I know
 
01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
the adate education grant amount so
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
therefore I can do simple math and know
 
01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
that this is approximately a $24 million
 
01:34:34.510 --> 01:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
State program I know clearly that 10% of
 
01:34:38.109 --> 01:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
that number is $2,436 th000 that there's
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
no Shenanigans there's no hidden stuff
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
here the the student receives a class
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
wallet that is managed by this their
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
stewards of the money the money doesn't
 
01:34:49.709 --> 01:34:49.719 align:start position:0%
go to the family it doesn't go to the
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
student it goes to the organization the
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
organization then Cruise expenditures
 
01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
out of the class wallet and most of the
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
time those expenditures are uh in the
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
form of a reimbursement so understanding
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
how the program works the narrative the
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
false narrative that you're hand hearing
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
about this program being anything other
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
than very transparent it's just not true
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
I I agree that if you want to look at
 
01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
the New York tax returns of this
 
01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
charitable organization you could get
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
some some stuff I don't think that the
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Branch I can't speak from
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
them would be happy to provide you any
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
information as one of the
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
representatives is is showing their
 
01:35:30.590 --> 01:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
website is a plethora of information for
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
how much money they spent of the 10%
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
what their actual operating costs were
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
that the respectfully this is just a a
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
trojan horse to be a backdoor attack on
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
this program I respect that some some
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders don't like the program some
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders like the program this if
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
you want to destroy the program I would
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
ask you to file legislation to just
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
revoke the program but don't do it in a
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
way that you try to be cute with saying
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
oh you were formed out of state and it's
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
not transparent so now we don't want the
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
program I'm asking you to be be
 
01:36:10.189 --> 01:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
transparent and and I think this program
 
01:36:10.199 --> 01:36:11.510 align:start position:0%
transparent and and I think this program
is

01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
transparent follow up yes Mr Campbell I
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
am not talking about being cute I am
 
01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
talking about obeying the
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
general uh method of transparency that
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
is done by 20 other states in the same
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
Pro program and
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
on and it is easily solved by
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
extending the I
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
believe uh automatic uh
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
legislative uh expiration date on the um
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
um sorry my head is full of
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
cold at this point but on the the
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
effective date enough that they can in
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
fact incorporate in New Hampshire the
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
way all of their colleagues have done
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the country I I I apologize
 
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative I did not mean to call
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
you or the sponsors of the bill anything
 
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
derogatory and I retract my statement
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
about cute I just I just I do think it's
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's important for the commune to
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
understand that this this bill um would
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
have a negative effect on the program
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
and I think that um it's not necessary
 
01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
for this for transparency for the for
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
this organization to have to be reformed
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
and be a a uh a nonprofit that was
 
01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:45.159 align:start position:0%
formed in New Hampshire um I just I just
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
I just disagree with that uh statement
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
um but I didn't mean to be disrespectful
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
to you or to the sponsors and I
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
apologize to the committee
 
01:37:57.910 --> 01:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Malloy thank
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:38:06.109 --> 01:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
question I appreciate your uh uh talk
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
about constitutional questions and so
 
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.229 align:start position:0%
about constitutional questions and so
on

01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:38:11.239 --> 01:38:14.070 align:start position:0%
on
uh

01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
however I
 
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
think I'm still working toward the
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
transparency of this and we as a group
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
here are responsible for taxpayer
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
money here in New Hampshire and I think
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
in my view would you agree
 
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
that more
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
clarity more uh information should be
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
made available to us as we spend
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money as laid out by the
 
01:38:48.310 --> 01:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
presenters of the Bill thank you I I
 
01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
think transparency is is absolutely
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
important with with taxpayer dollars and
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
I want to thank this Committee in the
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire for the taxpayer
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
dollars that they've allowed me to spend
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
to help offset the cost that me and my
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
family have born for decades to send you
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
know my five children to private schools
 
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't take lightly that that right
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
to receive a Catholic
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
Education um was always dependent upon
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
the size of your wallet and this program
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
was the first program in full
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
transparency that allowed lower inome
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
and middle inome people and even you
 
01:39:27.589 --> 01:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
know really I think higher income people
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
I don't believe in the income limit um
 
01:39:29.679 --> 01:39:30.790 align:start position:0%
I don't believe in the income limit um
the

01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity um to put their kids in an
 
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
educational environment of their choice
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
and to not be fiscally discriminated by
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
that so I think that the transparency
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
given that we know the amount of the
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
money we know the number of kids that
 
01:39:47.229 --> 01:39:47.239 align:start position:0%
receive it any other question that this
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee has I'd be happy to get you
 
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
that information I think it's readily
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
available on simple Google searches I
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
think that the the organization is
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
incredibly transparent we have nothing
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
to hide we have nothing up Our Sleeve
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
this is a wonderful program that someone
 
01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
has to manage these State dollars like I
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
don't think you can just send the money
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
to the parent and not know where it goes
 
01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
so this this class wallet this this
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofit managing the funds is very
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
similar to the the government uh schools
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
the public schools um receive state
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
funds four times throughout the years
 
01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:28.840 align:start position:0%
and they're the stewards of the money
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
that you send from the state we have to
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
have someone be the steward uh for this
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
money I would be in support of um you
 
01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:39.159 align:start position:0%
know work working with representative
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
luno to do a compromise that if you
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
wanted the EFA money to go directly to
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
an educational institution where a
 
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
student attended the school i' I'd be
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
open to to some kind of uh compromise
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
that perhaps would alleviate your trans
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
transparency or alleviate your concerns
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
about this nonprofit receiving 10% and
 
01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I'd rather the 10% go to
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
the school that's providing the
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
educational service so I think there's
 
01:41:08.589 --> 01:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
some room for discussion here and I
 
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
think there's room for compromise if the
 
01:41:13.629 --> 01:41:13.639 align:start position:0%
concern is the 10% and the transparency
 
01:41:15.550 --> 01:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
of where the 10% is being spent or how
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
it's being spent and I think that's a
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
legitimate question I do think it's
 
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
available on on public documents but the
 
01:41:25.750 --> 01:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
the money itself the grant amount and
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
where it goes to the student and the
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
fact that it's so well regulated by the
 
01:41:32.189 --> 01:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
program itself through the class wallet
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
and through the nonprofit and how funds
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
are dispersed or reimbursed is very
 
01:41:40.350 --> 01:41:40.360 align:start position:0%
transparent um but if you would rather
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
the money go directly to you know my
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
local Catholic school that operates in
 
01:41:46.950 --> 01:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
the basement of my church I would
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
welcome that because that would put
 
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
another 10% into that institution that's
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
providing the Educational Service hope I
 
01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
hope that answers the question all right
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
one more question uh representative
 
01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you chairman and thank
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I think you
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
had a lot of good facts I agree with a
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
lot of you what you said glad your
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
business and other things um uh have
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
been working out my question is would
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
you agree that it raises many red flags
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
when an organization blocks a normal uh
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
audit because that was part of the bill
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
that was how we were going to know if it
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
was doing well and successful and the
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
audit the normal one that the lbas do
 
01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
blocked um I I obviously I can't speak
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
to State agencies blocking Audits and
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
and but I uh I do respect that everybody
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
has you know different opinions on every
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
object and Regional people can disagree
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
I again would just say I don't think
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
we're blocking very
 
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
transparent uh disclosure on how the
 
01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
state funds are being spent and that's
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
where I think this committee needs to
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
focus like this committee has readily
 
01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
available whether this is uh non the
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
bill itself is about whether or not a
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that was formed decades ago in
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
another state can do business in New
 
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this bill is not about the the
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
transparency the the language that is
 
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
being changed is simply preventing the
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
one scholarship organization from being
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
able to continue to do its job so
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
although I respect the conversation
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
about transparency and I think it's a
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
very correlated when you're talking
 
01:43:31.629 --> 01:43:31.639 align:start position:0%
about the subject matter it's Germain
 
01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
but it's really not the matter before
 
01:43:34.589 --> 01:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
the committee the matter before the
 
01:43:38.350 --> 01:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
committee is are you going to violate
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
the constitution and three different
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
Clauses of it and say that a
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
organization a charitable organization
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
that was founded decades ago in another
 
01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
state can't do business in New Hampshire
 
01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
can't participate in this program and I
 
01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
I disagree that we should just comply
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
and form a new uh nonprofit because a
 
01:44:01.589 --> 01:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
representative wants you to no we should
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
respect the Constitution of the United
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
States of America the laws of the State
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and the Commerce Clause
 
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
and not go down this road it would be it
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
would be very poor precedent for any
 
01:44:18.109 --> 01:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee to
 
01:44:20.189 --> 01:44:20.199 align:start position:0%
follow what's really happening here in
 
01:44:24.589 --> 01:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Campbell
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I said no more questions all right
 
01:44:34.589 --> 01:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
y the supremacy clause applies however
 
01:44:40.189 --> 01:44:40.199 align:start position:0%
the Interstate Commerce Act also applies
 
01:44:42.030 --> 01:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
Corporation can't do business in New
 
01:44:44.189 --> 01:44:44.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unless it's registered in New
 
01:44:48.589 --> 01:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would disregard your
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional argument because I think
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
you're maybe Mis uh representing or
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
conflating it with
 
01:45:01.149 --> 01:45:01.159 align:start position:0%
uh other types of activities I'm just
 
01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
make that as a as a general comment
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
because you're crossing state lines so
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Clause is actually the
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
governing clause in this action as
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to the supremacy
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
clause um supremacy clause did apply for
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
example on U gay marriage that's once
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're married that's State you're
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
married in every other state except now
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
the other states recognized it so I I I
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the gay marriage comment I
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
think that's a great analogy in 2003
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
when Massachusetts made gay marriage uh
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
legal uh it was a big controversy here
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's a State Rep and and as a Republican
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
state rep I voted to recognize what the
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts did and I'm glad
 
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
I was on the right side of history on
 
01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:49.719 align:start position:0%
that because it was the right thing to
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
do this is a very similar thing you have
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
to recognize that New York has a right
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
to form a nonprofit and that that
 
01:46:01.709 --> 01:46:01.719 align:start position:0%
nonprofit has a right to do business in
 
01:46:04.270 --> 01:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and to your question that
 
01:46:06.189 --> 01:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
nonprofit did take the step of
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
registering at the Secretary of State
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
and they're registered to do business in
 
01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire what this bill does is it
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
it takes out the clause or registered in
 
01:46:17.589 --> 01:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it basically takes away
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
their right to Simply register in New
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like every other Corporation
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
or nonprofit can do and because it does
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
that it does it does in my limited
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional opinion they gave me one
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
when I became a state rep um and I and I
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
read it and these three Clauses apply
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
because that nonprofit corporation has a
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
right to the business of getting that
 
01:46:43.589 --> 01:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
10% fee and that's why it's a violation
 
01:46:45.550 --> 01:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
of the Commerce Clause because they're
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
doing interest rate interest rate
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
business and you're limiting their
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
ability to do interest rate business so
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
again I think I've i' I've had more than
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
an opportunity here thank you all very
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
much I hope you'll just find this bill
 
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate as we did in
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
the last legislative session and I I
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
would give serious consideration to to
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
doing the opinion of the justices
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
because we're doing the same thing over
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
and over again we're filing the same
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
bill over and over again let's let's
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
find out if it's constitutional let's
 
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
just put it to bed and then if it's
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional we can come back and have
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
a real talk about how we might want to
 
01:47:25.950 --> 01:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
okay uh the last pin card I have is um
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:40.669 --> 01:47:40.679 align:start position:0%
Matthew good morning again and uh I just
 
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on the last speaker's
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
commentary uh and just give you some
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
examples um my wife and I have been very
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
much involved in establish ing uh
 
01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%
charitable endowments and charitable
 
01:47:55.639 --> 01:47:56.709 align:start position:0%
charitable endowments and charitable
endowment

01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
endowment
 
01:47:58.750 --> 01:47:58.760 align:start position:0%
foundations uh we have set up Donor
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
advised foundations uh give you an
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
example we've got a Fidelity donor advis
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
Foundation we've got a an American
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
endowment Foundation American endowment
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
Foundation is headquartered out of uh
 
01:48:15.149 --> 01:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
Ohio and Fidelity charitable is I'm not
 
01:48:17.229 --> 01:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
sure if they're in Massachusetts or New
 
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
York or Delaware or wherever but they
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
are registered to do business in New
 
01:48:22.239 --> 01:48:23.589 align:start position:0%
are registered to do business in New
Hampshire

01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:48:26.430 --> 01:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
just as children's scholarship fund is
 
01:48:28.149 --> 01:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
registered to do business in New
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if you look at the way
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation is written the way this
 
01:48:36.669 --> 01:48:36.679 align:start position:0%
legislation is written where do we stop
 
01:48:38.910 --> 01:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
with that because in essence you can
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
stop and say okay Fidelity charitable
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
can no longer do business in New
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or American endowment
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
Foundation can no longer do business in
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh children's scholarship
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
fund if we go back when the original
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
bill was passed allowing something of
 
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
this nature back in 2 I think it was
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
between 2010 and 2012 sometimes uh they
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
were one of the first organizations that
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
Incorporated their business they they
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
did uh register in New Hampshire and
 
01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
then ultimately for purposes of of uh
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
economies of scale uh they were acquired
 
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
by and merged into children's
 
01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
scholarship New York uh the net result
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
of that was they were able to keep their
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
administrative costs down dramatically
 
01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
now as a an accountant a tax preparer uh
 
01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with this a lot and we
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
deal with a lot of nonprofits and uh one
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
of their biggest headaches is having to
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
file this kind of paperwork 990s what
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
have you so if you look at the uh the
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
fund itself children's scholarship fund
 
01:49:42.669 --> 01:49:42.679 align:start position:0%
and by the way my wife and I contribute
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
to that uh each year uh for purposes for
 
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
tax purposes for our two businesses
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
Legacy Financial Solutions and lfs Tax
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
Group so we can take it advantage of
 
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
what we think is a really good program
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh but the the fact of the matter is
 
01:50:01.149 --> 01:50:01.159 align:start position:0%
that uh an an organization that's giving
 
01:50:04.870 --> 01:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
out uh roughly 92% or a little more than
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
92% of every dollar collected and only
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
88% is hung up an administrative fee
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's terrific by charitable
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
standards and so what we're trying to do
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
here is to uh continue to minimize the
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
cost minimize the exposure and uh to the
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
other gentleman point the fact of the
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
matter is that if you do want the
 
01:50:28.510 --> 01:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
financial information you can get it uh
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
the the gentleman who introduced the
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
bill indicated that roughly 40% of the
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
New York money comes from State of New
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well if that's the case he was
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
able to get that information we also
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
know what's going out the door and and
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
and uh and then if we had 50 you know
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
5,000 or so people taking advantage of
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
the program for them to have to come
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
back and reimburse there were I think
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
there were three I I think the
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative do set so there were two
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
but I think there were three that they
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
had to reimburse uh because they were uh
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
not properly uh uh the funds were
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
improperly distributed and the
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
organization turned right around and
 
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursed the state uh so I don't think
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
we need to take this legislation any
 
01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
further I think we should just rule this
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
as uh inexpedient to
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you okay before I
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
recognize uh for questions let's just
 
01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
keep in mind we are 50 minutes behind
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
schedule um so let's try to stay focused
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
on what's really critical representa
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
alme yes the point we seem to be missing
 
01:51:34.589 --> 01:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
is that presumably most of the money
 
01:51:37.709 --> 01:51:37.719 align:start position:0%
that goes into this is public
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
money state
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
money and that the state should have the
 
01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
ability to audit
 
01:51:50.589 --> 01:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
it uh do you have any idea yourself
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
apparently people involved in it are get
 
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
more transparency than others on how
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
what part of the money that they use
 
01:52:04.830 --> 01:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
comes from the state well let's back up
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
on that because keep in mind that all of
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
the money that's contributed to that
 
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
fund is contributed by private
 
01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
businesses or
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
individuals and then ultimately what
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
happens is uh that money is in that
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
block and then the state turns around
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
and says okay we will reduce the tuition
 
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursements to the cities or towns
 
01:52:26.589 --> 01:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
for every individual that is taken out
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
system all right so the reality is the
 
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
money is not it it actually works to the
 
01:52:36.189 --> 01:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
state's Advantage for every individual
 
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
that is taken out of the the the public
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
system from a financial
 
01:52:45.149 --> 01:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
right follow up I do not think you
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
understand uh the structure of financing
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
for public
 
01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
education because when you take five
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
children out of a school you cannot take
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
away any of the fixed costs including
 
01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
all the salaries in that school it's not
 
01:53:15.229 --> 01:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
sufficient to be able to take even one
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
child worth
 
01:53:19.390 --> 01:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
out but when one child comes out of the
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
school does the state no longer have to
 
01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
reimburse that that
 
01:53:27.310 --> 01:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
District I believe that that is now the
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
law which means that the local
 
01:53:33.069 --> 01:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
population has to pay more and our
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
property taxes go up or they have to
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
reduce their school sizes and and act in
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%

six years I have introduced and
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
presented property tax releas approaches
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
concerning the cost of public education

on homes and businesses property taxes
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
today our legislature and the people of
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
our state are faced with the inevitable
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
reality of Republican leadership a
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
budget crisis and skyrocketing property
 
01:55:41.910 --> 01:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
tax increases to pay for their CEO
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
handouts for the last 30 years here in
 
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:46.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the Democrats have only
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
had control of the State House of
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
Representatives only three times the
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
last in 201920 202 as a matter of fact
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
the Democrats of New Hampshire have only
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
had control of the House of
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
Representatives three times in the last
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
50 years the considerable budget and
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
financial Issues new New Hampshire is
 
01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
suffering from is clearly a cause of
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
poor Republican budget policies and
 
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
priorities revenues that have been
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
slashed for a decade Revenue cut that
 
01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
favor the most wealthy Among Us are
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
coming dangerously behind projection and
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
departments are preparing cuts to
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
operations and services which will only
 
01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
be downshifted onto local property
 
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that's on our neighbors who
 
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
are already feeling the pinch of rising
 
01:56:34.069 --> 01:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
cost for Health Care energy Child Care
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
and housing we are hearing from towns
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
and cities alike the state is
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
downshifting costs that are forcing
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
budget committees select boards and town
 
01:56:46.069 --> 01:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
councils to raise property taxes across
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
the board that sentiment is not just
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
mine on its Public Access television
 
01:56:54.189 --> 01:56:54.199 align:start position:0%
show last last month Republican leader
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
and Manchester Alderman Joe Kelly lisar
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
said that when the state claimed to be
 
01:57:01.990 --> 01:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
lowering taxes it really meant higher
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
property taxes for the rest of us which
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
he knows about since Manchester has seen
 
01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
the highest property tax increase in a
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
decade with a Republican mayor in charge
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
granted Staters are working hard but
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
aren't getting ahead or even getting a
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
breather while billionaires and big
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
businesses are getting richer than ever
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
we can all agree Working Families and
 
01:57:26.069 --> 01:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
people deserve a system that works for
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
you not against you New Hampshire is
 
01:57:31.709 --> 01:57:31.719 align:start position:0%
just beginning to escape the horrors
 
01:57:33.669 --> 01:57:33.679 align:start position:0%
that happened in the last time we
 
01:57:37.069 --> 01:57:37.079 align:start position:0%
slashed the vital services like DCF now
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
we are hearing rumors on 10% or greater
 
01:57:43.870 --> 01:57:43.880 align:start position:0%
cuts to all agencies including DCF all
 
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
because the Republicans
 
01:57:49.149 --> 01:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
prioritize tax cuts for the ultra
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
wealthy granted Staters believe our
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
states economy is either stagnant or
 
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
declining and this is not an accident
 
01:57:59.229 --> 01:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
but the direct result of a republican
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
built system at favors the rich CEOs and
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations that leaves
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
the rest of us paying the bill with
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing property taxes and Rising
 
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
costs like representative Opel stated
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
when presenting House Bill 502 speaker
 
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.589 --> 01:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
reporting I'm sorry sir uh ask produce
 
01:58:26.589 --> 01:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
the bill not engage in a uh diet tribe
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
sir I think this relates right to the
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill it you haven't yet told the
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:59.550 --> 01:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
the bill amends how revenues from taxes
 
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
are allocated to the education trust
 
01:59:07.229 --> 01:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
fund I would rather not be here
 
01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
today in front of you but it is clear
 
01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
that the majority party that controls
 
01:59:13.390 --> 01:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
the levers of state government are not
 
01:59:16.510 --> 01:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
bringing solutions to the crisis they
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
started here and are responsible for
 
01:59:22.229 --> 01:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative people are not getting
 
01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
what they deserve while corporations and
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
alter Rich are contributing their fair
 
01:59:26.199 --> 01:59:28.270 align:start position:0%
alter Rich are contributing their fair
share

01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
share
 
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative yes Mr
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%

01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
of Wilman and Sutton who have asked me
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
to present their views on this bill this
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
is better presented as unanimous consent
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
or personal privilege this is not a
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
place for a diet trbe this is for a
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
discussion of what the bill
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%

please what does the bill do how does it
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
do it and how does it well
 
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
benefits because it's reallocating funds
 
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
fine but let's get into specifics of the
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
Bell please thank you
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
please yes Mr chairman I will try to
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:47.669 align:start position:0%
 
bit

02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
when this bill is for trying to stem the
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
rise of hikes in education property
 
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
taxes and
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
when it is
 
02:01:06.629 --> 02:01:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:10.589 --> 02:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
my residents of Wilman and Sutton that
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
it is their
 
02:01:15.709 --> 02:01:15.719 align:start position:0%
fault I say there is a misconception or
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
someone is
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
lying when leadership of the majority
 
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:22.910 align:start position:0%
lying when leadership of the majority
ority

02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
ority
 
02:01:26.109 --> 02:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
party says of the karge Regional School
 
02:01:28.189 --> 02:01:28.199 align:start position:0%
District community members which Sutton
 
02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
and Wilman are a part
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
of quote perhaps if they're unwilling to
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
cap themselves the state will step in
 
02:01:38.069 --> 02:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
and cap local taxes for them that
 
02:01:38.079 --> 02:01:39.790 align:start position:0%
and cap local taxes for them that
infuriates

02:01:39.790 --> 02:01:39.800 align:start position:0%
infuriates
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
me when the leader of this majority
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
party who is an advocate for own
 
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
personal freedom wants to dictate what
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
others should do and is willing to use
 
02:01:53.310 --> 02:01:53.320 align:start position:0%
the power of the state legislature to
 
02:01:56.510 --> 02:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
overrule local control and local
 
02:01:59.069 --> 02:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
decisions I stand in opposition and
 
02:02:01.149 --> 02:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
that's why this bill was brought
 
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
forth I am here because I am committed
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
to ensuring that we are doing what we
 
02:02:10.390 --> 02:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
can stop property tax Heights and not
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
raise a dime of taxes on the Working
 
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
Families and people of New Hampshire we
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
need a solution for local property tax
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
relief for public education
 
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
if you expect the corner office of this
 
02:02:27.589 --> 02:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
state to stop local property tax Heights
 
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
think again what we have heard from the
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
new governor so far is nothing but
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
threats of belt tightening and severe
 
02:02:38.669 --> 02:02:38.679 align:start position:0%
cuts to our agencies without seeming to
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
care how that would affect many of the
 
02:02:42.910 --> 02:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
hardworking Granite
 
02:02:45.550 --> 02:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
sters the least Among
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
Us in
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
conclusion why do we need to find
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
relief a the status quo is bankrupting
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
our state and putting the American Dream
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
Out Of Reach for far too many Granite
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
Staters B this is about ensuring that
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
those who benefit from our shared
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
Society also contribute to it C the
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
corporations and the ultry rich are not
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
the enemy but we do expect them to pay
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
their fair
 
02:03:22.910 --> 02:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
share D we must invest in our
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
communities and strengthen New Hampshire
 
02:03:27.270 --> 02:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
for the long term making it a place
 
02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
where seniors are taken care of families
 
02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
can Thrive and our children have real
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities to build a future and E by
 
02:03:39.069 --> 02:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
working together we can create a more
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
just and prosperous future for all
 
02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters and finally I am open to
 
02:03:50.189 --> 02:03:50.199 align:start position:0%
suggestions for how to a avoid cuts to
 
02:03:52.910 --> 02:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
essential services and ensure that
 
02:03:55.549 --> 02:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
everyone is contributing their fair
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
share while also keeping property taxes
 
02:04:08.229 --> 02:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
clerk thank you representative shamberg
 
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh will you take questions no I will not
 
02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
Reynolds thank you Mr chair and members
 
02:04:50.350 --> 02:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee I appreciate the
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today
 
02:04:53.669 --> 02:04:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh my name is John Reynolds I'm the
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
state director for the national
 
02:04:57.069 --> 02:04:57.079 align:start position:0%
Federation of Independent Business uh we
 
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
are a nonprofit nonpartisan organization
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
that represents more than 1700 small
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state um we're
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
here to testify in opposition to uh
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill 503 um I think in a prior
 
02:05:13.229 --> 02:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
testimony with the committee uh I
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
discussed how the recovery curve from
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
the pandemic looks a lot different for
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
our members for small businesses than it
 
02:05:20.109 --> 02:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
did for larger businesses and they
 
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
struggled you know years after after the
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic started and in the most recent
 
02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh small business survey uh called small
 
02:05:29.950 --> 02:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
business economic trends that nfib put
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
out just yesterday inflation Supply
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
costs labor costs worker shortages are
 
02:05:36.910 --> 02:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
still huge huge problems for small
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
businesses um and on top of that they're
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
facing the loss of a very important uh
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
Federal small business tax deduction at
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
the end of this year um if I understand
 
02:05:47.709 --> 02:05:47.719 align:start position:0%
the bill correctly I believe it would
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
raise uh business taxes by close to $700
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
million over the next next three years
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
and this is only going to exacerbate
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
those challenges for for small
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
businesses across the state um
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately much of that tax increase
 
02:06:03.069 --> 02:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
will fall on consumers and on workers um
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that just puts the squeeze on our
 
02:06:07.069 --> 02:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
members even more uh because their
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
customers are struggling their workers
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
are struggling they're struggling to get
 
02:06:13.189 --> 02:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
by um so we certainly hope that the
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee will find that bill as
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate no just leave
 
02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
it there thank you thank you very much
 
02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
any questions seeing none thank thank
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%

02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:35.270 align:start position:0%
you uh and the final pin card I have is
Sarah

02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
Scott thank you Mr chair and members of
 
02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:39.719 align:start position:0%
the committee for the opportunity to
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
testify here today my name is Sarah
 
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
Scott and I'm the deputy state director
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity here in New
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here today in
 
02:06:50.189 --> 02:06:50.199 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
h503 uh the tax relief that we've seen
 
02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
over the last decade has left New
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the fastest growing
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
economy in the Northeast and one that is
 
02:07:01.069 --> 02:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
the Envy of our neighbors this has made
 
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire more competitive and
 
02:07:04.430 --> 02:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
improved the quality of life for our
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
citizens we should be praising this work
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
not reversing it passing this bill would
 
02:07:11.430 --> 02:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
take us backwards it would leave us with
 
02:07:13.149 --> 02:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
among the highest business taxes in the
 
02:07:14.910 --> 02:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
country something that we've worked hard
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
to fix over the last 10 years and make
 
02:07:19.709 --> 02:07:19.719 align:start position:0%
us less attractive Not only would we
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
stop seeing the influx of new employees
 
02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
and jobs but we likely lose companies
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
who would flee such a hostile
 
02:07:28.990 --> 02:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
environment and additionally make no
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
mistake this is an income tax bill we've
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
just achieved being a truly no income
 
02:07:37.069 --> 02:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
tax state let's not ruin that progress
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
let's keep New Hampshire income taxfree
 
02:07:41.069 --> 02:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
so it's for these reasons that we ask
 
02:07:43.310 --> 02:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
you to oppose this
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you uh represent elme
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you on we have major problems with
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
the Bia at least uh understands with um
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
uh housing lack of housing therefore
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
lack of workers on with child care
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
therefore lack of workers on and other
 
02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:11.109 align:start position:0%
therefore lack of workers on and other
things

02:08:11.109 --> 02:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
on what how do you expect that we can
 
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
deal with this when we keep cutting
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
taxes could you explain the question you
 
02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
asking about how we'll afford the
 
02:08:31.069 --> 02:08:31.079 align:start position:0%
spending how how we will manage really
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
this bill to increase taxes on granite
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
Staters would do just the opposite of
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
that and would cause even more harm to
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
the families that are coming into the
 
02:08:40.669 --> 02:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
state um when you look at the issue of
 
02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
housing I think that has to do a lot
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
with regulation um and so definitely a
 
02:08:46.709 --> 02:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
separate issue than what we're
 
02:08:49.229 --> 02:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
discussing here today but when you look
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
at the ability for families to provide
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
um whether it's the cost of housing
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
groceries Child Care the more we
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
continue to tax them I think the harder
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
it is for them to stay in the state
 
02:09:02.910 --> 02:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to see businesses leaving
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
the state um if we were to increase
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
business taxes like this I think you
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
would see an influx of businesses moving
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
to uh different parts of the Northeast
 
02:09:15.470 --> 02:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
you would see jobs leaving with that
 
02:09:20.149 --> 02:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
provide any other
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
02:09:27.149 --> 02:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
you all right that's all I have for pin
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
cards is there anyone else who would
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
like to
 
02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
testify seeing none I'll close the
 
02:09:34.910 --> 02:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HP
 
02:09:38.109 --> 02:09:38.119 align:start position:0%
503 so we went from uh 50 minutes behind
 
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
behind uh
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
so um at this point we will take a lunch

the time being 107 I'm going to open the
 
03:08:17.950 --> 03:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing on hp6
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:36.590 --> 03:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chairman it's a
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here in front of ways and
 
03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
means I've spent lots of time in front
 
03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
of Finance talking about where the money
 
03:08:49.389 --> 03:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
should go and maybe not enough time in
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
front of ways and means about where the
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
money should come from but I'm delighted
 
03:08:57.229 --> 03:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
to be here and and to see um my
 
03:09:00.469 --> 03:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
long-term colleague the ranking uh
 
03:09:02.510 --> 03:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
member representative Army as I look
 
03:09:06.110 --> 03:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
around the room I think that we are
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps the only two people who were
 
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
here when the
 
03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
equalized rate of
 
03:09:18.870 --> 03:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
$660 for the state wide education
 
03:09:22.469 --> 03:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
property tax was established and so
 
03:09:24.429 --> 03:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
we've been here through the ups and the
 
03:09:24.439 --> 03:09:25.990 align:start position:0%
we've been here through the ups and the
downs

03:09:25.990 --> 03:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
downs
 
03:09:29.309 --> 03:09:29.319 align:start position:0%
and who knows we might actually finally
 
03:09:32.910 --> 03:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
be able to resolve this um I did notice
 
03:09:36.229 --> 03:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
that it that this bill is on schedule to
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
be exact next week I'm hoping that
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's because the chair decided that it
 
03:09:44.469 --> 03:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
was so clear and made so much sense that
 
03:09:48.150 --> 03:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
he'll be ready to to pass it and and if
 
03:09:52.269 --> 03:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
not then at least I would hope that he
 
03:09:55.790 --> 03:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
would uh join with his colleagu is here
 
03:09:58.469 --> 03:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
to retain the bill because in fact in
 
03:10:02.670 --> 03:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
the fullness of time um the day is going
 
03:10:05.950 --> 03:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
to come when the decision will be made
 
03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
that we ought to do something that is
 
03:10:12.269 --> 03:10:12.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional and this bill does that
 
03:10:15.469 --> 03:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
it is a simple bill now I don't know
 
03:10:19.269 --> 03:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
about you but when um someone comes
 
03:10:21.870 --> 03:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
before my committee right now it's
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and says it's a simple bill I
 
03:10:28.269 --> 03:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
roll my eyes because I know uh oh we're
 
03:10:33.269 --> 03:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
in for trouble but the fact is this is a
 
03:10:36.790 --> 03:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
simple bill and it's a simple bill that
 
03:10:39.910 --> 03:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
the Simplicity of which is supported by
 
03:10:42.389 --> 03:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
our wonderful
 
03:10:47.389 --> 03:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the um in the LBA and
 
03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
if you look at the if you read the bill
 
03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
which isn't too long and you look at the
 
03:10:57.389 --> 03:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
um at the fiscal note you could see how
 
03:10:59.630 --> 03:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
easy it would be do do to take the
 
03:11:02.750 --> 03:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
transition to finally figure out a
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional way to um to address the
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
issue of how we fund
 
03:11:14.950 --> 03:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
education um this bill raises money and
 
03:11:16.590 --> 03:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here and not down the
 
03:11:19.990 --> 03:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
hall it does not have anything to do
 
03:11:22.349 --> 03:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
with spending money that's for the other
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
guys to figure out this bill sets a rate
 
03:11:33.070 --> 03:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
of $5 per 1,000 of equalized property
 
03:11:36.750 --> 03:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
valuation it does not matter what town
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
you live in what city you live in it's
 
03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes that this is a state tax and
 
03:11:46.110 --> 03:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
under the state
 
03:11:51.030 --> 03:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
constitution uh um we believe in in
 
03:11:54.429 --> 03:11:54.439 align:start position:0%
equal responsibility and that's all that
 
03:11:59.550 --> 03:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
this bill does in fiscal year
 
03:12:06.190 --> 03:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:11.190 --> 03:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
1.62 billion that's b as in boy billion
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
per year which is approximately 1.26
 
03:12:19.590 --> 03:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:19.600 --> 03:12:21.630 align:start position:0%
 
$363

03:12:21.630 --> 03:12:21.640 align:start position:0%
$363
 
03:12:25.950 --> 03:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
million all swept Revenue would be
 
03:12:30.030 --> 03:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
remitted to the education trust fund not
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
retained locally as is the current
 
03:12:37.110 --> 03:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
practice this is a state tax it is not a
 
03:12:41.469 --> 03:12:41.479 align:start position:0%
local tax it is not a county tax it is
 
03:12:46.110 --> 03:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
not a school tax it is a state tax and
 
03:12:48.990 --> 03:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
therefore the State Should collect the
 
03:12:52.830 --> 03:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
money and have a direct say in then how
 
03:12:54.750 --> 03:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
that money gets
 
03:12:58.830 --> 03:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
distributed um this does in fact
 
03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate the opportunity for
 
03:13:05.389 --> 03:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities to retra to retain what
 
03:13:08.349 --> 03:13:08.359 align:start position:0%
has been euphemistically and
 
03:13:13.070 --> 03:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
inaccurately referred to as excess swept
 
03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
there is no excess swept um just as
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
there are no donor Towns at least if
 
03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
there is a donor town I don't know where
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is I come from Durham and in Durham
 
03:13:31.349 --> 03:13:31.359 align:start position:0%
we actually have to pay our own property
 
03:13:34.110 --> 03:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
taxes the town does not pay those taxes
 
03:13:37.750 --> 03:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
for us the city does not pay them we pay
 
03:13:41.710 --> 03:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
them as property owners and so in fact
 
03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
it is not the
 
03:13:47.550 --> 03:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
town um which is donating anything
 
03:13:50.229 --> 03:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
um the town money was never the town's
 
03:13:55.630 --> 03:13:55.640 align:start position:0%
money what this does is ensures that all
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers throughout the state no matter
 
03:14:02.349 --> 03:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
where they live will pay the same R rate
 
03:14:04.710 --> 03:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
as required by the New Hampshire
 
03:14:07.910 --> 03:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution there would be a cost a
 
03:14:11.389 --> 03:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
one-time cost of
 
03:14:17.070 --> 03:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
$300,000 for uh Dr to um implement the
 
03:14:20.349 --> 03:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
electronic filing and payment system
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's it this solves two identified
 
03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
problems certain property wealthy
 
03:14:30.750 --> 03:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
communities retaining state tax money
 
03:14:33.790 --> 03:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
and using it for purposes that the tax
 
03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
does not exist for and negative local
 
03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
tax rates for schools in
 
03:14:46.389 --> 03:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
unincorporated um locations where we
 
03:14:49.550 --> 03:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
give money for no reason having to do
 
03:14:52.349 --> 03:14:52.359 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of a Statewide property
 
03:14:56.070 --> 03:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
tax the school districts are struggling
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
with ever increasing burdens of Health
 
03:15:02.870 --> 03:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
Care energy and retirement expenses in
 
03:15:05.830 --> 03:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
addition to their core purposes the
 
03:15:08.349 --> 03:15:08.359 align:start position:0%
costs of special education have
 
03:15:12.190 --> 03:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
increased and the burden is borne
 
03:15:15.229 --> 03:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
unequally this bill does not spend any
 
03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
money but it's passage could create
 
03:15:20.830 --> 03:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the state to undertake
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
paying for special education it could
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
also provide Statewide assistance to
 
03:15:29.229 --> 03:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
reduce the swept burden on low and
 
03:15:32.189 --> 03:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
moderate income households it could do
 
03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
it in a way that is
 
03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:37.150 align:start position:0%
it in a way that is
constitutional

03:15:37.150 --> 03:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
03:15:41.630 --> 03:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
Equitable fair and actually given the
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
fact that we have been able to solve
 
03:15:46.229 --> 03:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
this problem for many many many many
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
years might be a way to get us to yes
 
03:15:54.790 --> 03:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
and I hope you will give this bill every
 
03:15:58.630 --> 03:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
every consideration I um distributed but
 
03:16:01.990 --> 03:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
I wasn't quite careful enough I think a
 
03:16:05.349 --> 03:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
little party favor to each of you um in
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
which um with your own you could see
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
your own town or the town you live in
 
03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
even though you might represent more
 
03:16:17.790 --> 03:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
than one town um the how the swiftt
 
03:16:22.389 --> 03:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh payments have fit into
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
um our inequitable system that that we
 
03:16:30.070 --> 03:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
have now this material was prepared by a
 
03:16:33.510 --> 03:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
former um uh representative
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
distinguished Republican who actually
 
03:16:38.550 --> 03:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
taught me how to read a
 
03:16:42.510 --> 03:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
budget many years ago 30 years
 
03:16:45.150 --> 03:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
ago and of course if he hasn't taught
 
03:16:47.469 --> 03:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
you yet I will tell you one big TR
 
03:16:49.630 --> 03:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
begin at the back of the budget read
 
03:16:52.670 --> 03:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
that first and then go to the front but
 
03:16:57.790 --> 03:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
that is um uh he will he will be uh he's
 
03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
here and he will be testifying and um he
 
03:17:05.030 --> 03:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
has prepared for the clerk a detailed uh
 
03:17:07.469 --> 03:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
summation of these individual reports
 
03:17:10.030 --> 03:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
that I've shared with you and would be
 
03:17:12.150 --> 03:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
happy particularly for those of you who
 
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
represent more than one town to um to
 
03:17:18.510 --> 03:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
give give you any additional information
 
03:17:23.469 --> 03:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
that you want um I um and I think that's
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
all I I have to say if you have any
 
03:17:28.670 --> 03:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
questions I'm glad to answer them thank
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
you um do we have any questions
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth uh thank you
 
03:17:35.790 --> 03:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
and welcome to ways and means thank you
 
03:17:38.070 --> 03:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative yeah um I might have
 
03:17:40.469 --> 03:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
missed it um did you say there was
 
03:17:42.790 --> 03:17:42.800 align:start position:0%
eventually going to be estimates for the
 
03:17:42.800 --> 03:17:44.790 align:start position:0%
eventually going to be estimates for the
individual

03:17:44.790 --> 03:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:17:47.670 --> 03:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
communities um
 
03:17:50.110 --> 03:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
representative well no wait a minute
 
03:17:52.469 --> 03:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
what I've showed you terms of the
 
03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
collection oh communities wouldn't be
 
03:17:58.630 --> 03:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
collecting it no no what the money will
 
03:18:02.950 --> 03:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
go yeah just as as we all as you know as
 
03:18:07.630 --> 03:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
we we pay the taxes and this for the
 
03:18:11.030 --> 03:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
first time will have the money clearly
 
03:18:14.950 --> 03:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
go where it belongs to the education
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
trust fund and it will not be by town or
 
03:18:22.510 --> 03:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
city or School District it will be by
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
the person who pays the
 
03:18:28.030 --> 03:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
taxes in fact the man behind the
 
03:18:32.070 --> 03:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
tree okay so follow up so I understand
 
03:18:35.710 --> 03:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
the $5 figure I just mean has anyone
 
03:18:39.150 --> 03:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
tried to play out as they did previously
 
03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
with the different levels of towns and
 
03:18:43.550 --> 03:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
so on you had an idea you know who the
 
03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
23 towns with ex you know all that I I
 
03:18:49.710 --> 03:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
to me that's course that's totally
 
03:18:53.309 --> 03:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
irrelevant since in fact the towns never
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
have paid and do not and will not pay
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
the taxes there are um very good
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
research organizations that exist in the
 
03:19:05.710 --> 03:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
state and I'm not sure exactly who um in
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to representative hall for
 
03:19:09.389 --> 03:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
representative Hall who will testify and
 
03:19:11.110 --> 03:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
they might know about that I don't
 
03:19:16.030 --> 03:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
because I've always orted um uh I don't
 
03:19:19.070 --> 03:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
believe in donor Towns now follow up too
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
against my religion I would just suspect
 
03:19:23.550 --> 03:19:23.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe I didn't word it correctly
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
that um Representatives would be very
 
03:19:29.110 --> 03:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
interested um whether they support this
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
or not of how it impacts their
 
03:19:34.269 --> 03:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
constituents that's really what I'm
 
03:19:37.710 --> 03:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
asking um I I hear you but it will it it
 
03:19:40.710 --> 03:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
will depend upon what what the property
 
03:19:44.950 --> 03:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
value is that there each individual
 
03:19:48.550 --> 03:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
constituent um is responsible for and
 
03:19:50.670 --> 03:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
that's how it will affect them it does
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
not affect people town by town city by
 
03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
City School District by School District
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
so the other is you know could be for
 
03:20:03.110 --> 03:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
amusement but I would suggest to you
 
03:20:05.229 --> 03:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
that people who have property that's
 
03:20:05.239 --> 03:20:06.950 align:start position:0%
that people who have property that's
worth

03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
worth
 
03:20:11.150 --> 03:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
,000 will pay $5 and if they have
 
03:20:13.910 --> 03:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
property that's worth a million you can
 
03:20:16.870 --> 03:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
do the math yourself and it's person by
 
03:20:19.469 --> 03:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
person property owner by property owner
 
03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
it is not relevant at all to um to a
 
03:20:29.229 --> 03:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:33.309 --> 03:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
town okay representative
 
03:20:33.319 --> 03:20:35.030 align:start position:0%
town okay representative
Aly

03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
Aly
 
03:20:35.040 --> 03:20:37.110 align:start position:0%
Aly
hi

03:20:37.110 --> 03:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
hi
 
03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:39.950 align:start position:0%
hi
on

03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:20:43.030 --> 03:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's uh I found your chart which
 
03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
maybe you haven't looked at the last
 
03:20:48.910 --> 03:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
page of this uh gives the percentage of
 
03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
property tax for schools raised by the
 
03:20:55.630 --> 03:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
tax at an equal rate everywhere which I
 
03:20:59.269 --> 03:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
guess is five bucks um yeah and it's
 
03:21:01.469 --> 03:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
different for each of us because it's a
 
03:21:05.710 --> 03:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
different town but um I'm wondering you
 
03:21:07.710 --> 03:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
will remember I think you were having to
 
03:21:10.950 --> 03:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
sit in the back at that point but uh you
 
03:21:14.429 --> 03:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
will remember that when we did this the
 
03:21:19.189 --> 03:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
first time we decided that we we thought
 
03:21:25.790 --> 03:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
that we would um make make the
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
payment come through
 
03:21:32.189 --> 03:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
the um I'm trying to remember I'm full
 
03:21:34.429 --> 03:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
it went to the town in the depending
 
03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
upon where you live I mean for example
 
03:21:38.550 --> 03:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
in Durham we have a CO um a Cooperative
 
03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
School District so the money went to the
 
03:21:44.830 --> 03:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
town of Durham of Lee and of Madbury and
 
03:21:48.429 --> 03:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
then the school District had a formula
 
03:21:52.030 --> 03:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
for how much each had to contribute and
 
03:21:55.229 --> 03:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
that then went on and meanwhile the
 
03:21:57.550 --> 03:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
towns got the float not the state even
 
03:21:59.189 --> 03:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
though it was State money the towns got
 
03:22:03.550 --> 03:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
the float and this to me is an example
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
it's actually my prime example of the
 
03:22:12.189 --> 03:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
value um of lobbyists in this in this
 
03:22:14.309 --> 03:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
state we don't have our own staff here
 
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the house except for the wonderful
 
03:22:18.030 --> 03:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
LBA a which you and the finance
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee benefit from um we depend upon
 
03:22:25.870 --> 03:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
lobbyists do a lot of the work and the
 
03:22:28.429 --> 03:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
municipal Association it was then a
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
slightly different Incarnation but the
 
03:22:34.389 --> 03:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
municipal Association was very very
 
03:22:37.229 --> 03:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
clever they in they really pushed to
 
03:22:39.790 --> 03:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
have the money go to the cities and
 
03:22:42.469 --> 03:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
towns which got the float and which by
 
03:22:45.389 --> 03:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
the way also got extra money to pay for
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
the computer capability that they would
 
03:22:54.990 --> 03:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
need all of that on what is a state tax
 
03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:57.229 align:start position:0%
need all of that on what is a state tax
and

03:22:57.229 --> 03:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:59.990 --> 03:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
um you have to decide whether you think
 
03:23:01.950 --> 03:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
that that was the best thing to do
 
03:23:04.429 --> 03:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
whether it's worked well or not I would
 
03:23:07.110 --> 03:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
suggest to you it hasn't I'd suggest to
 
03:23:10.229 --> 03:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
you that I would never prejudge using
 
03:23:14.389 --> 03:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
the word judge amusingly um what in fact
 
03:23:17.830 --> 03:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch will do but if I had
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
to bet I would bet it will be sooner
 
03:23:23.510 --> 03:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
rather than later that there will be a
 
03:23:27.670 --> 03:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
decision that says enough is enough we
 
03:23:32.670 --> 03:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
need to have a tax a state tax
 
03:23:35.790 --> 03:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
system that under the existing New
 
03:23:35.800 --> 03:23:36.950 align:start position:0%
system that under the existing New
Hampshire

03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:23:40.110 --> 03:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution requires that everybody pay
 
03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
the same rate without regard to where
 
03:23:46.229 --> 03:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
they live not the same bottom line but
 
03:23:49.630 --> 03:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
the same rate and that's what's
 
03:23:53.189 --> 03:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
important follow up yeah but it it
 
03:23:56.189 --> 03:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're continuing with the
 
03:23:59.550 --> 03:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
idea that it's the municipalities that
 
03:24:02.910 --> 03:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
are going to identify the property of
 
03:24:05.469 --> 03:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
everybody in in the
 
03:24:08.630 --> 03:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
municipality and send a bill to them
 
03:24:11.550 --> 03:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
collect the money and then ma Mass it up
 
03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
count it and send it straight to to uh
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
the treasur office that's a good
 
03:24:22.349 --> 03:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
question representative Aly it's not
 
03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
quite how I understood it my
 
03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
understanding was that what the
 
03:24:28.269 --> 03:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue
 
03:24:31.750 --> 03:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
Administration would do um as part of
 
03:24:31.760 --> 03:24:34.309 align:start position:0%
Administration would do um as part of
its

03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
its
 
03:24:39.670 --> 03:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
um usual work of um of setting rights um
 
03:24:43.349 --> 03:24:43.359 align:start position:0%
would do that and the money would go to
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and um
 
03:24:50.510 --> 03:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of the period is it every five
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
years that is it every five years now
 
03:24:55.870 --> 03:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
that they have to uh reass I think it's
 
03:24:58.670 --> 03:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
for every five years you know nothing of
 
03:25:00.309 --> 03:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
that changes now maybe that should or
 
03:25:02.150 --> 03:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't but this doesn't deal with
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
this this only because it's a simple
 
03:25:08.670 --> 03:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
Bill all it does is raise
 
03:25:14.030 --> 03:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
money using what a number of us believe
 
03:25:14.040 --> 03:25:15.309 align:start position:0%
money using what a number of us believe
is

03:25:15.309 --> 03:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:25:19.790 --> 03:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
constitutionally require and that is um
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
a same rate regardless of whether you
 
03:25:26.870 --> 03:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
live in um regardless of where you live
 
03:25:29.070 --> 03:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter Rich poor
 
03:25:31.189 --> 03:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
whatever one of the things that I
 
03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
particularly like about this bill
 
03:25:38.469 --> 03:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
representative Aly is that it because of
 
03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
the the reasonable $5 is below the 663
 
03:25:47.309 --> 03:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
that we started with at one point um uh
 
03:25:49.510 --> 03:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
and of course that figure can be be
 
03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
adjusted that it is conceivable that
 
03:25:55.309 --> 03:25:55.319 align:start position:0%
there would be enough money raised to
 
03:25:57.229 --> 03:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
address the
 
03:26:01.630 --> 03:26:01.640 align:start position:0%
problems uh faced by
 
03:26:04.510 --> 03:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
um individual property
 
03:26:07.269 --> 03:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
tax payers at the
 
03:26:10.670 --> 03:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
lower end of the income scale I mean
 
03:26:12.550 --> 03:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
there might be a mean but that would
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
then affect everybody also it would see
 
03:26:18.830 --> 03:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
anybody at this level of income could
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
get a break in effect in in the and we'd
 
03:26:25.389 --> 03:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
still have enough money to do what we
 
03:26:28.189 --> 03:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing by the way this
 
03:26:30.590 --> 03:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
number you know you know we're 50th in
 
03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
the country for what we're spending uh
 
03:26:38.150 --> 03:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
this number of this this Revenue figure
 
03:26:43.070 --> 03:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
would put us at about the middle of all
 
03:26:45.750 --> 03:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
states in the United States and wouldn't
 
03:26:50.189 --> 03:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
it be nice that for this at least we
 
03:26:52.189 --> 03:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be first and we wouldn't be
 
03:26:53.790 --> 03:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
last it would kind of be like the Three
 
03:26:57.790 --> 03:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
Bears you know not too hot not too cold
 
03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:00.469 align:start position:0%
Bears you know not too hot not too cold
just

03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
right yeah I'm I'm looking at section
 
03:27:08.750 --> 03:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
two on lines 3
 
03:27:12.150 --> 03:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
to8 and it it looks to me like it's
 
03:27:14.030 --> 03:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
still going to
 
03:27:16.750 --> 03:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
be assessed locally
 
03:27:20.510 --> 03:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
and collected locally and then sent to
 
03:27:20.520 --> 03:27:27.750 align:start position:0%
and collected locally and then sent to
the

03:27:27.750 --> 03:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:27.760 --> 03:27:29.429 align:start position:0%
 
state

03:27:29.429 --> 03:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:27:32.550 --> 03:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad you're on ways and wings and
 
03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't see it that way but um
 
03:27:38.150 --> 03:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I would yield to people behind me I
 
03:27:39.870 --> 03:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's someone here from
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
Dr I don't know if there's someone here
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
I do know there are people here from
 
03:27:45.790 --> 03:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
some other organizations I can't answer
 
03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
that representative thank
 
03:27:50.550 --> 03:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:27:54.750 --> 03:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
y thank you to kind of follow up on it's
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
good to be here thank you representative
 
03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's always good to see you thank you
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:09.469 --> 03:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
okay following up on what representative
 
03:28:10.910 --> 03:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
Aly just
 
03:28:14.189 --> 03:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
said if the is required to set in
 
03:28:17.150 --> 03:28:17.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph one a certain C
 
03:28:20.309 --> 03:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
fee or a certain dollar
 
03:28:23.670 --> 03:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
value that's not part of your bill but
 
03:28:27.389 --> 03:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
part of the law then we modify
 
03:28:31.630 --> 03:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
$5 what do we number one what do we do
 
03:28:35.309 --> 03:28:35.319 align:start position:0%
with the
 
03:28:38.309 --> 03:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
excess if there is any or what do we do
 
03:28:41.830 --> 03:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
if there's an underage if there is
 
03:28:46.189 --> 03:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
any and thirdly
 
03:28:48.670 --> 03:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
how's it is is the distribution going to
 
03:28:51.630 --> 03:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
change is this going to do what you
 
03:28:54.389 --> 03:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
intend for it to do is is the ultimate
 
03:28:58.070 --> 03:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
question this bill is very
 
03:29:01.630 --> 03:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
narrow all this bill addresses is how we
 
03:29:05.550 --> 03:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
raise the money in order
 
03:29:05.560 --> 03:29:07.189 align:start position:0%
raise the money in order
to

03:29:07.189 --> 03:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:11.030 --> 03:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
conform with what many of us believe is
 
03:29:13.269 --> 03:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
our constitutional
 
03:29:16.870 --> 03:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
obligation what happens after that
 
03:29:19.510 --> 03:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
is respons is is the
 
03:29:22.189 --> 03:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the people down the
 
03:29:24.150 --> 03:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
hall um turned around now because I'm
 
03:29:25.670 --> 03:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
not in the regular meeting down the hall
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
that way um in the new fancy education
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
committees and down the hall the other
 
03:29:35.910 --> 03:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
way in finance how they choose to spend
 
03:29:39.469 --> 03:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
education is in you know for them but
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:52.469 --> 03:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
constitutionally uh
 
03:29:52.479 --> 03:29:54.229 align:start position:0%
constitutionally uh
appropriate

03:29:54.229 --> 03:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:29:57.910 --> 03:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
binding way of
 
03:30:02.349 --> 03:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
raising money that means that no matter
 
03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
where you
 
03:30:08.670 --> 03:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
live you have each person each taxpayer
 
03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
in the state pays at the same rate not
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:30:16.510 --> 03:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
dollar but the same rate and this
 
03:30:18.630 --> 03:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't address any of the Myriad
 
03:30:21.150 --> 03:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
questions it doesn't say okay if we
 
03:30:24.510 --> 03:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
raise this money then maybe we could um
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
we could this will get some of you very
 
03:30:29.429 --> 03:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
happy maybe we could lower another tax
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
or two um or maybe we could undertake to
 
03:30:38.910 --> 03:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
um address the problems of people with s
 
03:30:41.790 --> 03:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
with limited incomes or maybe we can
 
03:30:46.030 --> 03:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
remove the financial responsibility of
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
special education from each school
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
district and have the state take it or
 
03:30:56.910 --> 03:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
maybe we could um address the long-term
 
03:30:59.590 --> 03:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
problems of uh the physical
 
03:31:02.309 --> 03:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
deterioration of school buildings or
 
03:31:05.309 --> 03:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
maybe we could return to the way that
 
03:31:08.150 --> 03:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
the state had once supported uh
 
03:31:11.469 --> 03:31:11.479 align:start position:0%
retirement for uh for teachers there are
 
03:31:13.630 --> 03:31:13.640 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things that the other guys
 
03:31:18.830 --> 03:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
could do all this does is say in a fair
 
03:31:21.630 --> 03:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
and Equitable and constitutional way we
 
03:31:25.870 --> 03:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
would be raising money that is State
 
03:31:28.389 --> 03:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
money that would be in the control of
 
03:31:34.070 --> 03:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
the State education trust fund for those
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
decision makers charged with those
 
03:31:39.429 --> 03:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to make the necessary
 
03:31:42.189 --> 03:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
decisions follow
 
03:31:42.199 --> 03:31:43.830 align:start position:0%
decisions follow
up

03:31:43.830 --> 03:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:31:47.309 --> 03:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
yes oh that thank you very much this was
 
03:31:50.510 --> 03:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
very nice can I leave now yes I I
 
03:31:53.870 --> 03:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to do
 
03:31:58.790 --> 03:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
however I'm kind of suspicious that it's
 
03:32:01.670 --> 03:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know you're kind of number one the
 
03:32:05.710 --> 03:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
requirement for any taxation is as
 
03:32:09.550 --> 03:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
professorn repeatedly thanks
 
03:32:12.510 --> 03:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
to uh representative only when she was
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
the chairman drummed into people it's
 
03:32:17.309 --> 03:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
got to be equ and
 
03:32:20.910 --> 03:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
proportionate this appears to be
 
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
Equitable that is it's the same and is
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
proportionate because it's proportionate
 
03:32:29.630 --> 03:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
to each one don't need to have an
 
03:32:32.110 --> 03:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
equalized value because it's based
 
03:32:35.189 --> 03:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
strictly on whatever the town assesses
 
03:32:37.750 --> 03:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
your property at that's your assess
 
03:32:37.760 --> 03:32:38.870 align:start position:0%
your property at that's your assess
local

03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
local
 
03:32:41.790 --> 03:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
assessment so that's fine but it's going
 
03:32:44.469 --> 03:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
to ra if it raises a pot if it raises a
 
03:32:46.990 --> 03:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
pot of money
 
03:32:52.389 --> 03:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
fund then the distribution of the F of
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
the funds or how it's proportionally set
 
03:33:02.510 --> 03:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
out isn't clear as
 
03:33:05.309 --> 03:33:05.319 align:start position:0%
to whether this is going to
 
03:33:09.550 --> 03:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
raise the funds that you wish and the
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
follow on question to that wouldn't it
 
03:33:16.229 --> 03:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
then make it exceptionally easy
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
in a budget reconciliation activity to
 
03:33:22.870 --> 03:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
races from five to five and a half to
 
03:33:28.670 --> 03:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
six to six and a half to seven to 8 to
 
03:33:32.550 --> 03:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
20 on the part of succeeding leg with
 
03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
what I would say in response to that
 
03:33:37.229 --> 03:33:37.239 align:start position:0%
representative ol is not if you're still
 
03:33:40.110 --> 03:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
here and on the ways
 
03:33:44.269 --> 03:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
in times are limited well I I understand
 
03:33:47.670 --> 03:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
that but you know if we can
 
03:33:49.269 --> 03:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
I mean we are
 
03:33:52.389 --> 03:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for setting the policy of
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
the state and sometimes we make the
 
03:33:59.389 --> 03:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
right decisions and sometimes we make
 
03:34:01.469 --> 03:34:01.479 align:start position:0%
the wrong decisions and sometimes we
 
03:34:03.429 --> 03:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
make decisions that are right at one
 
03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
point but the world around us changes
 
03:34:10.150 --> 03:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
and so too to those people who are
 
03:34:14.870 --> 03:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
elected and we see that every two years
 
03:34:16.429 --> 03:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:34:19.229 --> 03:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh this isn't going to change that this
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
isn't going to change the fact that the
 
03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
legislature is responsible for setting
 
03:34:23.160 --> 03:34:24.590 align:start position:0%
legislature is responsible for setting
the

03:34:24.590 --> 03:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
policy thank you any other
 
03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you um oh
 
03:34:32.070 --> 03:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry has been on a while know it's
 
03:34:36.630 --> 03:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
a blind spot I understand oh it's
 
03:34:39.510 --> 03:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
just thank you for taking my question
 
03:34:41.990 --> 03:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
again I did figure out the answer to the
 
03:34:44.550 --> 03:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
other I can just take several people's
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
incomes and do the and have an idea of a
 
03:34:49.870 --> 03:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
high middle low so I understand that now
 
03:34:52.910 --> 03:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
um so I think you really clarified that
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
you're raising the funds they are going
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
to um the education trust fund um would
 
03:35:02.309 --> 03:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
you agree um that your next goal is
 
03:35:04.670 --> 03:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
really to have a fair distribution chart
 
03:35:07.189 --> 03:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
like we've had before so you know that
 
03:35:10.110 --> 03:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
you're wanting to have a chart um that
 
03:35:12.750 --> 03:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
really helps the state as a whole and
 
03:35:14.590 --> 03:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
certain needy sections like special it
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
or whatever you're turning it over to
 
03:35:20.750 --> 03:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
someone else but would that be your hope
 
03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:22.429 align:start position:0%
someone else but would that be your hope
representative

03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:35:27.389 --> 03:35:27.399 align:start position:0%
Southworth I believe strongly in the
 
03:35:29.630 --> 03:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
importance of public
 
03:35:34.229 --> 03:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
education in in a democratic small D in
 
03:35:38.469 --> 03:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
in a democracy I think that it is Our
 
03:35:40.910 --> 03:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
obligation as adults not just as
 
03:35:43.790 --> 03:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
legislators to do everything that we can
 
03:35:45.990 --> 03:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
to meet the educational needs of
 
03:35:51.229 --> 03:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
everybody in this state um I how best to
 
03:35:51.239 --> 03:35:52.070 align:start position:0%
everybody in this state um I how best to
do

03:35:52.070 --> 03:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
that varies I mean I will tell you right
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
off for example that um there are not a
 
03:36:04.510 --> 03:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people in um in the caucus I
 
03:36:08.990 --> 03:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
preside in who are enthusiastic about
 
03:36:13.590 --> 03:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
public charter schools I happen to be a
 
03:36:16.070 --> 03:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
supporter of public charter schools
 
03:36:21.309 --> 03:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
because I believe that having choices
 
03:36:26.229 --> 03:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
about how um a particular child can best
 
03:36:30.189 --> 03:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
learn are important as long as when we
 
03:36:33.870 --> 03:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
are using public dollars our dollars
 
03:36:36.309 --> 03:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
there must be standards there must be
 
03:36:38.750 --> 03:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
accountability there must be
 
03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:40.710 align:start position:0%
accountability there must be
transparency

03:36:40.710 --> 03:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
03:36:44.750 --> 03:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
um all of that I think is important but
 
03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say therefore this it
 
03:36:54.510 --> 03:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
must be X Y or Z I won't do that and um
 
03:36:57.990 --> 03:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh look if I were you know if I had my
 
03:37:00.910 --> 03:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
brothers I would say I was in charge and
 
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
I would make all the decisions and you
 
03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
know I'd be happy with all the decisions
 
03:37:09.630 --> 03:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
but that not being the world that I live
 
03:37:13.150 --> 03:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
in I continue to be willing and maybe
 
03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
I'm naive I continue to be willing
 
03:37:19.469 --> 03:37:19.479 align:start position:0%
willing to trust in the ability of
 
03:37:21.910 --> 03:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
people with disperate views with
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
disperate backgrounds with disperate
 
03:37:27.269 --> 03:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
goals to figure out how responsibly to
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
come together and not to create a
 
03:37:33.910 --> 03:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
perfect world but to at least move us in
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
you now seeing no more questions thank
 
03:37:44.590 --> 03:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much and do
 
03:37:46.469 --> 03:37:46.479 align:start position:0%

03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
week when you expect this Bill thank you
 
03:37:48.960 --> 03:37:56.630 align:start position:0%
week when you expect this Bill thank you
thank

03:37:56.630 --> 03:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.750 --> 03:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you chair janigan I have
 
03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
the uh coveted position of getting to
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
follow representative Smith on this
 
03:38:15.950 --> 03:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation so
 
03:38:18.790 --> 03:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
I'm here today as a co-sponsor I think
 
03:38:21.229 --> 03:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative Smith handled this
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
conversation quite well just to affirm
 
03:38:27.150 --> 03:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
my support for the fair rate that would
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
be set up in this
 
03:38:31.710 --> 03:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
legislation uh to bring a little
 
03:38:34.469 --> 03:38:34.479 align:start position:0%
personal story forward I grew up in the
 
03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
manad region born in Kean I went to
 
03:38:41.550 --> 03:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
school in the conval school district
 
03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
and while we had a great well-funded
 
03:38:46.990 --> 03:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
School with a lot of opportunities and a
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
lot of different uh venues open to us as
 
03:38:53.670 --> 03:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
students right down the road 10 minutes
 
03:38:55.469 --> 03:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
down the road in the neighboring town of
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey they had about 10 times less the
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities and the pathway for
 
03:39:05.309 --> 03:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
Success that I did simply because of the
 
03:39:09.870 --> 03:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
unequitable rate of the funding for
 
03:39:11.950 --> 03:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
Education uh that to me is just an
 
03:39:14.510 --> 03:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
unacceptable reality for the kids in our
 
03:39:16.229 --> 03:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
state because it leaves people with the
 
03:39:18.750 --> 03:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
Hales and the haves knots uh the halves
 
03:39:21.309 --> 03:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
and the haves knots that's a tongue
 
03:39:23.830 --> 03:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
twister and I don't think that's an
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate situation for our state
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
especially given the fact that we in our
 
03:39:32.590 --> 03:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution have education and a good
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
education as a founding tenant to the
 
03:39:38.510 --> 03:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
state so chair janigan that's all I have
 
03:39:41.950 --> 03:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
to say I believe in a fair rate for all
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
as opposed to shifting that burden onto
 
03:39:50.110 --> 03:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
certain towns as opposed to others the
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
burden if we are going to have a
 
03:39:56.189 --> 03:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide education tax should be
 
03:39:59.950 --> 03:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
Statewide thank you Mr chair questions
 
03:40:01.469 --> 03:40:01.479 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm specifically making
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
sure that uh representative southworth's
 
03:40:12.030 --> 03:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
Willer okay next up representative
 
03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:23.870 align:start position:0%
Willer okay next up representative
Maguire

03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.229 --> 03:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dan
 
03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
Maguire I represent the town of
 
03:40:33.630 --> 03:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
Epsom to me this bill is like a big
 
03:40:38.950 --> 03:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
slice of chocolate cake it's extremely
 
03:40:42.110 --> 03:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
tempting um If This Were to pass it
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
would certainly make my life as a member
 
03:40:46.189 --> 03:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
of the fin
 
03:40:50.309 --> 03:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
committee way way easier than it is at
 
03:40:54.110 --> 03:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
this moment right this bill
 
03:40:56.510 --> 03:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
um will
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
raise another what is it $800 9900
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
million doll or something that's we
 
03:41:04.590 --> 03:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
don't have going into the budget right
 
03:41:09.150 --> 03:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
now and the budget is extremely tight I
 
03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
mean we're we're at the you know looking
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
under the couch cushions for loose
 
03:41:19.429 --> 03:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
change type type of stage here and
 
03:41:19.439 --> 03:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
change type type of stage here and
um

03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:26.110 --> 03:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
but it's you know and and there's parts
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
of this bill that I certainly will vote
 
03:41:32.389 --> 03:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
for and and are in other bills um going
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
along with the Rand decision I think is
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
correct I I think the Court's ruling uh
 
03:41:40.110 --> 03:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
and Logic on the Constitution is correct
 
03:41:42.870 --> 03:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
on that one um so that's that $28
 
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
Million number that you see in the fisc
 
03:41:49.389 --> 03:41:49.399 align:start position:0%
note um we have that in I'm also a
 
03:41:50.950 --> 03:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
member of the education funding
 
03:41:52.710 --> 03:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
committee we have that in two other
 
03:41:54.510 --> 03:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
bills in front of our
 
03:41:57.389 --> 03:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
committee um you could you could
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
certainly argue that that having a fixed
 
03:42:03.990 --> 03:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
dollar amount of $63 million for
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax is you know it
 
03:42:10.950 --> 03:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
was set many many years ago certainly
 
03:42:13.110 --> 03:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
there's been inflation since then when
 
03:42:16.149 --> 03:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
we were working on the budget we use
 
03:42:19.870 --> 03:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
2019 as a as a kind of a base to to kind
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
of get before Co and and up to today and
 
03:42:25.429 --> 03:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
there's been just in those six years
 
03:42:28.830 --> 03:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
there's been 25% inflation so so you
 
03:42:31.349 --> 03:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
know you could easily argue that that
 
03:42:33.229 --> 03:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
you know that number should be 500
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
million or something like that um but
 
03:42:42.309 --> 03:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
but to have a tax increase of that
 
03:42:45.469 --> 03:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
magnitude um though you know our cens
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
are going to have to would have to pay
 
03:42:51.189 --> 03:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
it I mean it's it's just um it's it's a
 
03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
lot more money uh collected now um You
 
03:42:59.309 --> 03:42:59.319 align:start position:0%
can argue well if if um all we're going
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
to do is rebate that money to to other
 
03:43:06.269 --> 03:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers right to others that that are
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
um um paying less uh State white
 
03:43:12.630 --> 03:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
property tax or or more local property
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
tax and some of that will happen right
 
03:43:17.830 --> 03:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
so I think should this bill pass in this
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
current form um some of it will will end
 
03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
up going back either to you know
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
directly to those taxpayers or or to
 
03:43:31.030 --> 03:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
towns um I mean
 
03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:32.870 align:start position:0%
towns um I mean
schools

03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:43:36.469 --> 03:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
but I have a feeling
 
03:43:38.990 --> 03:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
that given the way we are with the with
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
the budget um not all will you know some
 
03:43:46.389 --> 03:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
of it will be used to um to fill some of
 
03:43:48.990 --> 03:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
the holes that we have in the budget and
 
03:43:51.550 --> 03:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
that that will be a real tax
 
03:43:56.429 --> 03:43:56.439 align:start position:0%
increase um I I came in Sor at the tail
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
end of of some of your discussion I do
 
03:44:02.110 --> 03:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
think if if it's an issue and you were
 
03:44:03.870 --> 03:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
to implement something like this it
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
would have to be based on equalized
 
03:44:09.469 --> 03:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
valuation not on sort of nominal
 
03:44:11.309 --> 03:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
valuation and I'm not sure that's
 
03:44:16.750 --> 03:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
correct in the bill as is um
 
03:44:20.349 --> 03:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
and uh what else
 
03:44:22.830 --> 03:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
um anyways I guess I'm I'm happy to
 
03:44:26.229 --> 03:44:26.239 align:start position:0%
answer questions I I it's this is a
 
03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
tough subject I I would suggest if
 
03:44:31.149 --> 03:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
you're the final committee on this that
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
there are some bills from my education
 
03:44:35.670 --> 03:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
funding committee that that have a
 
03:44:39.309 --> 03:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
chance to pass and and will come here as
 
03:44:41.790 --> 03:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
a second committee perhaps so you might
 
03:44:44.670 --> 03:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
want to wait and and not EXA this
 
03:44:46.830 --> 03:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow tomorrow I don't know I don't
 
03:44:48.750 --> 03:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
know if this is like an early bill from
 
03:44:53.750 --> 03:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
your point of view or not um so I'm
 
03:44:55.590 --> 03:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions it uh to
 
03:44:57.950 --> 03:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
answer your question it is an early bill
 
03:45:00.309 --> 03:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
so it will go to finance is that it okay
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
most likely all right so maybe that
 
03:45:04.269 --> 03:45:04.279 align:start position:0%
that's the you know we'll we'll get a
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of these kind of bills in
 
03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
finance and then and then we'll we'll
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
merge them and and shuffle them um one
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
thing if you if that we will deal with
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
if assuming it passes education funding
 
03:45:20.149 --> 03:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
is we have a bill that
 
03:45:25.710 --> 03:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
um that imposes a uh school budget cap
 
03:45:28.750 --> 03:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
um along with this kind of an idea right
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
so so more money coming in but you can't
 
03:45:35.790 --> 03:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
spend more and therefore uh it all has
 
03:45:39.070 --> 03:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
to go out to to other you know property
 
03:45:42.630 --> 03:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers basically kind of you know uh
 
03:45:45.510 --> 03:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
flatten the the curve of of property tax
 
03:45:49.309 --> 03:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
I guess um and so that's another another
 
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
thing we'll have to think about
 
03:45:51.560 --> 03:45:53.429 align:start position:0%
thing we'll have to think about
representative

03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:45:59.309 --> 03:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
question If This Were to pass it's kind
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the same question I asked
 
03:46:07.070 --> 03:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives If This Were to pass it
 
03:46:10.149 --> 03:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
would create a big chunk of money going
 
03:46:12.870 --> 03:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
into the educational trust
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
fund if it's in the education trust fund
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
it has to stay there it can't come out
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
correct yes and it would continue to
 
03:46:23.550 --> 03:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
build and continue to build so there
 
03:46:26.429 --> 03:46:26.439 align:start position:0%
would be this huge amount of money in
 
03:46:29.149 --> 03:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
the educational trust fund the purpose
 
03:46:31.149 --> 03:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
would be to spend
 
03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
it and the qu and the reference was made
 
03:46:37.110 --> 03:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire being 50th as far as
 
03:46:39.790 --> 03:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
money is being spent but I think we're
 
03:46:43.630 --> 03:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the top qu or quarter of
 
03:46:45.990 --> 03:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
states that
 
03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
regarding educational
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
Excellence so we're spending Less in
 
03:46:53.710 --> 03:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
getting a better result okay thank you
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
for the question let me let me get into
 
03:46:57.469 --> 03:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
that so what they what they people
 
03:46:59.710 --> 03:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
commonly say is we're in the top five in
 
03:47:03.389 --> 03:47:03.399 align:start position:0%
results all right I personally think our
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
results are pretty horrible it's just
 
03:47:08.070 --> 03:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
that we're in the top five compared to
 
03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
even worse right elsewhere right so so
 
03:47:15.229 --> 03:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
the actual numbers in terms of uh these
 
03:47:16.910 --> 03:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
standardized tests that are used all
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
over the country are that roughly 50% of
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
our students can read at grade level and
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
and only about 40% can do math at grade
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
level so those are horrible horrible
 
03:47:31.590 --> 03:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
numbers in my opinion but um they are
 
03:47:33.590 --> 03:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
what they are and and like I said other
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
places are even worse so so I wouldn't
 
03:47:39.429 --> 03:47:39.439 align:start position:0%
rest on our laurels in any sense of of
 
03:47:41.550 --> 03:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
the word
 
03:47:43.950 --> 03:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
um your other question about the
 
03:47:46.189 --> 03:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
contents of the of the education trust
 
03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
fund you're right that the way the law
 
03:47:53.189 --> 03:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
is now um the education trust fund is a
 
03:47:57.269 --> 03:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
um non-aps fund and um if it ever ran
 
03:47:59.590 --> 03:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
out it would get refilled from the
 
03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
general fund but it doesn't go the other
 
03:48:05.389 --> 03:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
way however the other taxes that we put
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
into the fund other than than Lottery
 
03:48:10.229 --> 03:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
lottery has to go into the education
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
trust fund but we put a significant
 
03:48:17.790 --> 03:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
amount of BET PT liquor you know Etc
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
monies into that fund um and that
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's no particular reason that we
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
have to continue those at the same level
 
03:48:28.830 --> 03:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's likely uh were this bill to
 
03:48:32.469 --> 03:48:32.479 align:start position:0%
pass that we would to some degree lower
 
03:48:35.550 --> 03:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
that level of those other taxes going
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do that anyways
 
03:48:41.309 --> 03:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
because right now um that fund is is
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
flush with cash and the general fund is
 
03:48:46.910 --> 03:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
under right I if I remember the numbers
 
03:48:49.229 --> 03:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
right this current fiscal year is
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
projected education plus plus general
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
funds to come in at roughly 200 million
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
below plan um and you guys probably know
 
03:49:02.830 --> 03:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
that number better than I do but but but
 
03:49:06.990 --> 03:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the the bium the the um
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is projected to
 
03:49:13.110 --> 03:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
have over aund million left in it but
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
the general fund is a projected to have
 
03:49:19.229 --> 03:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
negative uh 80 or 90 or something like
 
03:49:21.469 --> 03:49:21.479 align:start position:0%
that right so
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to have to um readjust
 
03:49:27.630 --> 03:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
what goes into you know what goes into
 
03:49:30.149 --> 03:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund from business
 
03:49:34.630 --> 03:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:37.189 --> 03:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
inevitable representative
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
elme thank
 
03:49:39.840 --> 03:49:42.309 align:start position:0%
elme thank
you

03:49:42.309 --> 03:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:49:46.670 --> 03:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm I had really thought before of
 
03:49:49.510 --> 03:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
what how we had managed which we have a
 
03:49:52.030 --> 03:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
couple of times to take money away from
 
03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund when we could
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
use it better in the general fund um but
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that
 
03:50:05.110 --> 03:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
explanation on I am wondering you seem
 
03:50:07.510 --> 03:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
to think that there's something valuable
 
03:50:11.110 --> 03:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself not necessarily the
 
03:50:11.120 --> 03:50:12.630 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself not necessarily the
five

03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:50:16.189 --> 03:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh and that it would be used use ful in
 
03:50:18.510 --> 03:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
your education policy
 
03:50:22.750 --> 03:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee funding committee but
 
03:50:27.630 --> 03:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
um it is an early bill and we have to
 
03:50:29.710 --> 03:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
put something in a
 
03:50:34.469 --> 03:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
blurb that would allow it to go forward
 
03:50:37.349 --> 03:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
without liking some of the stuff that's
 
03:50:41.389 --> 03:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
in it some of at least some of us so um
 
03:50:43.229 --> 03:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions uh yes thanks for the for
 
03:50:49.590 --> 03:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
the question I well again whether this
 
03:50:51.950 --> 03:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
particular bill goes forward or not we
 
03:50:54.630 --> 03:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
like I said we we do have the Rand type
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
of stuff in at least two other bills in
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
front of my committee I expect at least
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
one of those to pass um the the other
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
part about changing the I mean this is
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
the main part of this is is changing the
 
03:51:09.359 --> 03:51:11.309 align:start position:0%
the main part of this is is changing the
363

03:51:11.309 --> 03:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
363
 
03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
million both increasing it and also so
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
changing it to um away from a fixed
 
03:51:22.229 --> 03:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and toward a um a variable
 
03:51:25.510 --> 03:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
amount well a um mill rate type of an
 
03:51:30.630 --> 03:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
amount um that's up to you guys I mean
 
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
um I think as long as you make sure that
 
03:51:35.950 --> 03:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
that it's equalized
 
03:51:39.389 --> 03:51:39.399 align:start position:0%
valuation um it's not I don't I don't
 
03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
think it would be horrible to be a mill
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
rate I mean that would tend to
 
03:51:48.189 --> 03:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
um tend to take the inflation aspects
 
03:51:50.070 --> 03:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
out of it right that it would it would
 
03:51:54.070 --> 03:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
sort of um tend to tend to uh track with
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
inflation over time that's not a you
 
03:52:01.429 --> 03:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
know that's that part alone is not super
 
03:52:04.389 --> 03:52:04.399 align:start position:0%
objectionable to me it's more just you
 
03:52:06.030 --> 03:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
got to look at this as a big tax
 
03:52:08.750 --> 03:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
increase that's that's my main message
 
03:52:11.429 --> 03:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
and so um are you comfortable with that
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
tax increase I don't know
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
so uh you're you're basically saying
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
let's say that we itl this bill you
 
03:52:22.269 --> 03:52:22.279 align:start position:0%
already have other bills in the
 
03:52:24.510 --> 03:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee that are addressing this
 
03:52:27.070 --> 03:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
similar issue that address Rand
 
03:52:29.110 --> 03:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely I don't know that we have
 
03:52:31.670 --> 03:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
another bill that specifically changes
 
03:52:36.670 --> 03:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
the 363 million so that aspect of
 
03:52:36.680 --> 03:52:39.149 align:start position:0%
the 363 million so that aspect of
it

03:52:39.149 --> 03:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:52:39.159 --> 03:52:40.950 align:start position:0%
it
um

03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:45.070 --> 03:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
actually I'm not sure so um
 
03:52:46.830 --> 03:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
maybe I I I can try to get back to you
 
03:52:50.070 --> 03:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
on that part okay thank you yes
 
03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
um representative my understanding is
 
03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
that um whether we're in the top five
 
03:53:03.950 --> 03:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
because of our achievement or in the top
 
03:53:06.429 --> 03:53:06.439 align:start position:0%
five because the other 45 are
 
03:53:06.439 --> 03:53:08.870 align:start position:0%
five because the other 45 are
worse

03:53:08.870 --> 03:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
worse
 
03:53:08.880 --> 03:53:10.590 align:start position:0%
worse
um

03:53:10.590 --> 03:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:14.710 --> 03:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
I is based on the fact that the state of
 
03:53:14.720 --> 03:53:15.670 align:start position:0%
I is based on the fact that the state of
New

03:53:15.670 --> 03:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 50th in terms of the state
 
03:53:22.110 --> 03:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
contribution to public
 
03:53:24.790 --> 03:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
education and so whatever success we
 
03:53:24.800 --> 03:53:26.429 align:start position:0%
education and so whatever success we
might

03:53:26.429 --> 03:53:26.439 align:start position:0%
might
 
03:53:31.590 --> 03:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:33.349 align:start position:0%
 
comes

03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
comes
 
03:53:36.149 --> 03:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
mainly if not almost exclusively on the
 
03:53:38.149 --> 03:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
backs of property
 
03:53:40.830 --> 03:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um in my community those
 
03:53:44.670 --> 03:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers are really struggling
 
03:53:48.229 --> 03:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
we don't have the assessed
 
03:53:50.670 --> 03:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
valuation that some other communities
 
03:53:54.750 --> 03:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
have so I hope you will
 
03:54:00.550 --> 03:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
understand that I find it difficult to
 
03:54:03.670 --> 03:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
be able to go back to my district and
 
03:54:07.990 --> 03:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
explain to them the belief here that the
 
03:54:11.870 --> 03:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
overflowing and yet there struggling
 
03:54:16.590 --> 03:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
with property tax
 
03:54:19.269 --> 03:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
bills to make sure that their kids have
 
03:54:21.590 --> 03:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
a decent
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
education even though it's completely
 
03:54:26.030 --> 03:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
dependent on the ZIP code that they live
 
03:54:27.670 --> 03:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
in all I understand thank you for the
 
03:54:29.670 --> 03:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
question and I had meant to to address
 
03:54:34.070 --> 03:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more so um we are 50th
 
03:54:36.830 --> 03:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right we're we're 50th
 
03:54:40.229 --> 03:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of State moving money from
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
state level taxes to education right
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're 50th or even close
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amount we spend for
 
03:54:53.189 --> 03:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
Education right total spending on
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
education Statewide K through 12 is
 
03:55:01.149 --> 03:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
approaching $4 billion dollar a year um
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know on public education so I mean
 
03:55:07.389 --> 03:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
which is averaging about close to
 
03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
$22,000 a kit so that's a lot of money
 
03:55:13.550 --> 03:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
right I mean that that nationally is not
 
03:55:17.710 --> 03:55:17.720 align:start position:0%
low so so but you're right only a small
 
03:55:20.309 --> 03:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
amount of that is coming from state
 
03:55:24.309 --> 03:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
level resources right so so perhaps you
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
missed my
 
03:55:28.550 --> 03:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
point you are correct that we spend a
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money on public
 
03:55:34.950 --> 03:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
education in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
and whether it's the rest of the states
 
03:55:41.550 --> 03:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
aren't as good as we are or we're better
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
than them whatever it is we're achieving
 
03:55:43.920 --> 03:55:45.149 align:start position:0%
than them whatever it is we're achieving
something

03:55:45.149 --> 03:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
with those contributions with the amount
 
03:55:49.990 --> 03:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
of money we spend but the amount of
 
03:55:52.990 --> 03:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
money we spend don't you
 
03:55:56.750 --> 03:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
agree is coming from property taxpayers
 
03:56:00.870 --> 03:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
it is coming from towns and cities and
 
03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's coming from places like my
 
03:56:07.550 --> 03:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
town who struggle to afford to be able
 
03:56:09.550 --> 03:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
to provide their
 
03:56:11.710 --> 03:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
children with the best possible
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
education that they can afford and and
 
03:56:16.830 --> 03:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
recently have been attacked for doing
 
03:56:24.750 --> 03:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah thank you for the question and
 
03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
you you're absolutely right I mean the
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
the bulk of money spent is property tax
 
03:56:32.830 --> 03:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
right even this this is property tax
 
03:56:35.189 --> 03:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
right here right I mean you know that's
 
03:56:38.070 --> 03:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
our biggest tax right I mean they we
 
03:56:40.750 --> 03:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't have another tax I mean we have
 
03:56:42.790 --> 03:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
business taxes and so on but they they
 
03:56:46.309 --> 03:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
pale in comparison the property tax u in
 
03:56:48.110 --> 03:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
terms of our you know that's our major
 
03:56:53.269 --> 03:56:53.279 align:start position:0%
tax Source here and and for for a very
 
03:56:56.469 --> 03:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
long time you know hundreds of
 
03:57:01.750 --> 03:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
years um school funding has been a local
 
03:57:08.269 --> 03:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
matter right I mean the um part one um
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
article six of the Constitution said
 
03:57:15.790 --> 03:57:15.800 align:start position:0%
that the locality will hire teachers
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
quote at their own
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
expense um and it said that from when
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
the Constitution was adopted until
 
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
1968 right so you know schools are a
 
03:57:32.590 --> 03:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
local thing right and so doing
 
03:57:35.630 --> 03:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
this is a big change right I mean it's
 
03:57:38.710 --> 03:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
it's it it changes it from a local thing
 
03:57:42.590 --> 03:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
to a to a more of a Statewide thing and
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to I
 
03:57:47.910 --> 03:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
inevitably affect local control and
 
03:57:49.750 --> 03:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
things like that now one other thing
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that I've learned about
 
03:57:55.790 --> 03:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
education is that
 
03:57:59.269 --> 03:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and I would suggest you go to um a
 
03:58:03.710 --> 03:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
website called edun nomics edu nomics
 
03:58:06.630 --> 03:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
it's from the Georgetown University in
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
Washington DC and they take the data
 
03:58:12.149 --> 03:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
from our department of Ed and all the
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
other department of EDS around the state
 
03:58:18.030 --> 03:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
and display it in a really uh accessible
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
way but they have displays where they
 
03:58:24.510 --> 03:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
show um results in schools you know test
 
03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
scores versus spending in schools down
 
03:58:29.950 --> 03:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
to the individual School level so you
 
03:58:31.950 --> 03:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
can look at your school and your school
 
03:58:34.429 --> 03:58:34.439 align:start position:0%
and your school and see where you are
 
03:58:36.830 --> 03:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
you know how's my test scores how's my
 
03:58:41.429 --> 03:58:41.439 align:start position:0%
spending um per pupil and there it's
 
03:58:44.070 --> 03:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
what's surprising about it is there's a
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
essentially zero correlation between
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
spending and test scores okay we have
 
03:58:52.870 --> 03:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
some schools in this state are spending
 
03:58:55.229 --> 03:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
$115,000 a kid and we have others that
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
are spending $30,000 a kid and and it
 
03:59:02.389 --> 03:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
looks like a big you know polka dot or
 
03:59:05.189 --> 03:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
something you know chart there isn't a
 
03:59:08.149 --> 03:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
correlation where there is correlation
 
03:59:12.990 --> 03:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
and and this you would expect is between
 
03:59:17.389 --> 03:59:17.399 align:start position:0%
um sort of circumstance and test scores
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
right so if you're from a a
 
03:59:23.070 --> 03:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged family you know this would
 
03:59:24.630 --> 03:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
be what we would call free and reduced
 
03:59:28.630 --> 03:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
lunch right so when those things are uh
 
03:59:31.070 --> 03:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
when a high percentage of a school
 
03:59:33.710 --> 03:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
students um are from disadvantaged
 
03:59:36.630 --> 03:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged families they
 
03:59:39.229 --> 03:59:39.239 align:start position:0%
have low test scores when it's when
 
03:59:41.790 --> 03:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
they're from uh wealthier families they
 
03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
have high test scores but you know
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
what that means is I think education
 
03:59:51.670 --> 03:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
makes people wealthier right and so kids
 
03:59:54.030 --> 03:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
are more like their parents right I mean
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
they're if they're good in school
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
they'll be in those uh higher levels and
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
if they're not so good in school they'll
 
04:00:02.149 --> 04:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
be in the lower and those things carry
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
on but but in terms of just sort of
 
04:00:09.670 --> 04:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
thinking that a poor performing school
 
04:00:12.469 --> 04:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
if it spends more it will necessarily
 
04:00:15.309 --> 04:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
move up the test score
 
04:00:17.790 --> 04:00:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh level it'd be nice if that were true
 
04:00:21.070 --> 04:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
but it it really doesn't seem to be you
 
04:00:23.670 --> 04:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
know my last question uh representative
 
04:00:26.590 --> 04:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
do you believe that test scores are the
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
only or even the best
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:36.870 --> 04:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
education I'm not sure I know enough
 
04:00:40.349 --> 04:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
about that I mean um I I know
 
04:00:43.110 --> 04:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's what it's the data we
 
04:00:48.189 --> 04:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
have right so um you could probably look
 
04:00:52.269 --> 04:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
at uh fraction going to college some of
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff but but I would think
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
they would all sort of correlate um and
 
04:01:00.149 --> 04:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know that any other kind of data
 
04:01:04.870 --> 04:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
is is available so okay any other
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.630 --> 04:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:39.550 --> 04:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:39.560 --> 04:01:42.389 align:start position:0%
 
gonna

04:01:42.389 --> 04:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
really uh my
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
local State Rep um Sai isn't here today
 
04:01:51.309 --> 04:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
the only other person on the committee
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
that I know is representative Aly up
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
there um I should give you some sense of
 
04:02:00.510 --> 04:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
why I'm here and it has to do with my
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
background I was a member of this house
 
04:02:05.030 --> 04:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
for four terms and in three of those
 
04:02:07.510 --> 04:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
terms on the finance committee I was
 
04:02:10.469 --> 04:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
responsible for school funding the
 
04:02:10.479 --> 04:02:11.630 align:start position:0%
responsible for school funding the
division

04:02:11.630 --> 04:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
2 and this was for the Claremont
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
decisions when we had the old so-called
 
04:02:17.239 --> 04:02:19.550 align:start position:0%
decisions when we had the old so-called
augenblick

04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
augenblick
 
04:02:23.070 --> 04:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
formula and school funding was an issue
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
then just as it is an issue now um at
 
04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
that time when I first one on that
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
committee the new governor Jud
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
Greg came to the New Hampshire house and
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
said we've got to cut the
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
budget Johnson unu had just left and Jud
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
Greg had taken over and it's not unlike
 
04:02:49.750 --> 04:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
what you're hearing today which is the
 
04:02:52.830 --> 04:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle is going to be a big
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
problem and Jud Greg's plan was to
 
04:03:00.670 --> 04:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
remove all state funding from the public
 
04:03:05.269 --> 04:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
schools with the exception of the
 
04:03:09.149 --> 04:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
lottery so that was my first
 
04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
inauguration with um the question of
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
school funding
 
04:03:17.469 --> 04:03:17.479 align:start position:0%
um I only served four terms I decided
 
04:03:20.670 --> 04:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
not to run again uh but then I became
 
04:03:22.630 --> 04:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
the founding executive director of the
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Center for Public Policy
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
studies and two years later the
 
04:03:31.830 --> 04:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
Claremont decisions uh were issued and I
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
helped organize the first major
 
04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
conference here in uh New Hampshire
 
04:03:41.389 --> 04:03:41.399 align:start position:0%
about how to define and cost an adequate
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
education and watched the legislature
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
here go through um two years really from
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
1997 to
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
1999 trying to come up with a plan to
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
respond to those
 
04:03:59.229 --> 04:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
decisions what I can tell you right now
 
04:04:03.070 --> 04:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
is the plan that was passed in
 
04:04:07.030 --> 04:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
1999 if everybody had left well enough
 
04:04:10.830 --> 04:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
alone there would be no lawsuits in
 
04:04:14.110 --> 04:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
front of the courts right now
 
04:04:14.120 --> 04:04:16.110 align:start position:0%
front of the courts right now
a

04:04:16.110 --> 04:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
$660 property tax equalized value and by
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
the way House Bill 669 does need to be
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
amended in that section two to make sure
 
04:04:28.469 --> 04:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
it's clear that what's being described
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
as a $5 rate on equalized value but a
 
04:04:38.750 --> 04:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
$660 rate would take care think of it if
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
if $5 raises an additional 1.2 billion
 
04:04:47.229 --> 04:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
what would a 6.6 raise there would be
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
enough money in the education trust fund
 
04:04:52.189 --> 04:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
if everything had been left alone to
 
04:04:54.110 --> 04:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
have no problem in front of you in
 
04:04:56.349 --> 04:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
regard to school
 
04:05:01.790 --> 04:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
funding um the material I've provided
 
04:05:08.110 --> 04:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
you um representative Smith gave you um
 
04:05:11.110 --> 04:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
the one two charts for the town you live
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
in but on the material provided you I
 
04:05:17.790 --> 04:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
put the all the towns from all the
 
04:05:20.110 --> 04:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
committee members because I want to make
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:27.429 --> 04:05:27.439 align:start position:0%
that first this bill solves three
 
04:05:29.469 --> 04:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
problems it makes the
 
04:05:32.670 --> 04:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property taxed at
 
04:05:37.469 --> 04:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
whatever rate a valid constitutional tax
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
by making sure that everybody pays the
 
04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
same rate that's important
 
04:05:48.830 --> 04:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
it sets a fixed rate by legislative
 
04:05:52.149 --> 04:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
action what other tax as Ways and Means
 
04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
Committee what other tax do you give the
 
04:05:58.830 --> 04:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
some state agency bureaucracy the
 
04:06:02.389 --> 04:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
ability to change the rate from year to
 
04:06:04.710 --> 04:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
year I don't know of
 
04:06:08.229 --> 04:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
any at least no major tax the insurance
 
04:06:11.229 --> 04:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
tax the communications tax the business
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
taxes they're Changed by legislative
 
04:06:18.429 --> 04:06:18.439 align:start position:0%
action this bill would put the Statewide
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
property tax back in the same um set of
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
conditions it'll raise 1.26 billion of
 
04:06:30.670 --> 04:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue above the
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:40.229 --> 04:06:40.239 align:start position:0%
year the bill does not say how it would
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
be spent you've pointed that out uh you
 
04:06:47.630 --> 04:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
understand that and that's important
 
04:06:50.070 --> 04:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
because and it means that we can't
 
04:06:53.070 --> 04:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
identify town by Town what would this
 
04:06:54.990 --> 04:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
mean because we don't know what the
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
distribution mechanism would be and
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
here's where this year's
 
04:07:04.910 --> 04:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
organization of the process is going to
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
be causing a problem in
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
1999 there was no Ways and Means
 
04:07:11.760 --> 04:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
1999 there was no Ways and Means
Committee

04:07:13.990 --> 04:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
04:07:16.349 --> 04:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
there had been an Appropriations
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
Committee and a Ways and Means Committee
 
04:07:21.149 --> 04:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
for some years Appropriations being what
 
04:07:25.109 --> 04:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
we now call Finance but in 1999 Ways and
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
Means was collapsed in one committee the
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
finance committee was responsible both
 
04:07:34.510 --> 04:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
for raising the revenue and for spending
 
04:07:38.189 --> 04:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
it so pieces fit together in that
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
committee this year you have your work
 
04:07:44.790 --> 04:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
and you have at least two two Finance
 
04:07:47.070 --> 04:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
committees the school finance committee
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
and and the large finance committee
 
04:07:53.590 --> 04:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
trying to solve this problem of school
 
04:07:56.830 --> 04:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
Finance so it's harder for you than it
 
04:07:59.469 --> 04:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
was in 1999 in
 
04:08:02.389 --> 04:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
1999 the bill that passed to set this up
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
was a Republican bill Don aitech was
 
04:08:09.550 --> 04:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House Neil Kirk some of
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
you may remember Neil it hasn't been too
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
many years since he's been here but Neil
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
Kirk was chair of that finance committee
 
04:08:20.590 --> 04:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
and supported that bill House Bill
 
04:08:24.109 --> 04:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
999 in in
 
04:08:27.030 --> 04:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
1999 okay so on these charts that I've
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
given you I want to point out a couple
 
04:08:32.309 --> 04:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
things for each
 
04:08:38.229 --> 04:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
Town 1996 1997 1998 on the left side of
 
04:08:41.710 --> 04:08:41.720 align:start position:0%
each chart that was the T local tax rate
 
04:08:44.149 --> 04:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
for schools in those years
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
in each town and you will
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
notice that those tax rates before
 
04:08:55.910 --> 04:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
reform were higher than the 1999 tax
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
rates after reform every town saw a
 
04:09:03.229 --> 04:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
reduction in its property
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
taxes it can be
 
04:09:06.640 --> 04:09:08.469 align:start position:0%
taxes it can be
done

04:09:08.469 --> 04:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
now second thing to look at in these
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
charts starting with 19 1999 you'll note
 
04:09:19.670 --> 04:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
that the bar has two portions the black
 
04:09:22.109 --> 04:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
lower portion or blue I guess in the
 
04:09:25.710 --> 04:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
color ones the blue lower portion is the
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
tax the local school tax rate and the
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
lighter upper portion is the Statewide
 
04:09:35.349 --> 04:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
property tax rate so when you stack the
 
04:09:38.590 --> 04:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
two that's the total tax rate in that
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
community equalized tax
 
04:09:46.510 --> 04:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
rate notice that in your town in all of
 
04:09:50.830 --> 04:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
the towns here that in n in
 
04:09:55.710 --> 04:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
1999 almost half of the property taxes
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
being raised in the town were
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
swept now go over to the far right 2023
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
the num the year isn't there but the far
 
04:10:12.590 --> 04:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
right column notice that the Statewide
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
property ta tax the upper little piece
 
04:10:18.389 --> 04:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
is less than
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
10% of the total property taxes being
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
raised for school what does that mean it
 
04:10:29.790 --> 04:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
means that 20 some years ago 20 five
 
04:10:29.800 --> 04:10:30.630 align:start position:0%
means that 20 some years ago 20 five
years

04:10:30.630 --> 04:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:10:30.640 --> 04:10:32.269 align:start position:0%
years
ago

04:10:32.269 --> 04:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
20 25 26 years ago half of the property
 
04:10:41.189 --> 04:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
taxes were being raised by an equal rate
 
04:10:46.630 --> 04:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:50.469 --> 04:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
state now it's only 10% of the property
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
taxes that fund school that are being
 
04:10:55.630 --> 04:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
raised in a constitutionally valid
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
manner that's why there are two lawsuits
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
out there the conval lawsuit and the
 
04:11:02.399 --> 04:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
out there the conval lawsuit and the
Rand

04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
Rand
 
04:11:07.389 --> 04:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
lawsuit if House Bill
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
999 from
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
1999 were still in effect those
 
04:11:16.910 --> 04:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
um those lawsuits wouldn't have been
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
necessary to be
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
filed and there'll be decisions coming
 
04:11:23.229 --> 04:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
down hopefully in the next couple months
 
04:11:25.389 --> 04:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
that are going to force some decisions
 
04:11:28.630 --> 04:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
upon you and your finance committee
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
members and I would hope that you can at
 
04:11:34.590 --> 04:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
least retain this
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
bill so that it's available if if the
 
04:11:40.030 --> 04:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court makes a
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
decision issues its decision on
 
04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
March 20th that you've got a bill that
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
with there's one other thing that I'd
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
like to well maybe two other things I'd
 
04:11:57.550 --> 04:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
like to add uh one had to do with a
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
question about that uh representative
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
McGuire was asked about achievement
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
levels and yes New Hampshire students
 
04:12:08.910 --> 04:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
are among the top five states in the
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
country when you use any of the sort of
 
04:12:13.630 --> 04:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
readily available National achievement
 
04:12:17.109 --> 04:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
tests and that makes us feel good did
 
04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know that there are quite a few
 
04:12:20.670 --> 04:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
school districts in this state where
 
04:12:23.950 --> 04:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
those results are lower than the lowest
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
state in the
 
04:12:29.790 --> 04:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
country the issue to be dealt with by
 
04:12:33.429 --> 04:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
making education a state responsibility
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
which the Constitution requires is to
 
04:12:38.830 --> 04:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that students no matter where
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
they are have an opportunity to achieve
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
well our average is good our
 
04:12:48.550 --> 04:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
distribution is all over the place
 
04:12:51.550 --> 04:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
because we rely on unequal property
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
taxes to fund the majority of
 
04:12:54.600 --> 04:12:56.469 align:start position:0%
taxes to fund the majority of
educational

04:12:56.469 --> 04:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
educational
 
04:13:00.030 --> 04:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
costs I'll leave it at
 
04:13:00.040 --> 04:13:04.109 align:start position:0%
costs I'll leave it at
that

04:13:04.109 --> 04:13:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative Spar thank you
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
chair um the your your uh statement
 
04:13:13.710 --> 04:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
three here in your front page
 
04:13:17.030 --> 04:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh you said that uh this go uh allowing
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
for reduction of the same amount in
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
local property taxes if you're raising
 
04:13:23.149 --> 04:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
1.26 billion for the State education
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
allowing for a reduction of the same
 
04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
amount in local property taxes um but
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't necessarily apply for each
 
04:13:33.750 --> 04:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
different town or District right you're
 
04:13:36.349 --> 04:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
just saying that's correct so some some
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
towns will benefit more some will lose
 
04:13:43.710 --> 04:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
more so uh I can tell you for just the
 
04:13:46.910 --> 04:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
ones here um without the numbers on the
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
distribution but generally speaking the
 
04:13:53.469 --> 04:13:53.479 align:start position:0%
communities with low property wealth per
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
pupil such as charl
 
04:13:59.149 --> 04:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
town would benefit greatly and the
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers there would benefit
 
04:14:05.349 --> 04:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
greatly on the other
 
04:14:08.830 --> 04:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
hand uh towns with high property value
 
04:14:08.840 --> 04:14:09.590 align:start position:0%
hand uh towns with high property value
per

04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
per
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
pupil uh which there aren't many within
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
this committee by by the way the Lakes
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
Region towns and the uh Ry and um SE
 
04:14:21.590 --> 04:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
Coast towns are not so well represented
 
04:14:24.269 --> 04:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
in this committee but those towns might
 
04:14:26.910 --> 04:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
well see an increase in their taxes but
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
how to actually calculate it it depends
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
on what the distribution mechanism is so
 
04:14:37.109 --> 04:14:37.119 align:start position:0%
if the distribution of $800 million
 
04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is about what special education
 
04:14:42.670 --> 04:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
cost total costs Transportation
 
04:14:42.680 --> 04:14:44.070 align:start position:0%
cost total costs Transportation
everything

04:14:44.070 --> 04:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
everything
 
04:14:46.670 --> 04:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
okay if that $800 million is sent out
 
04:14:46.680 --> 04:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
okay if that $800 million is sent out
based

04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
based
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
on each District's special education
 
04:14:54.030 --> 04:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
cost you get one change in tax rate if
 
04:14:56.830 --> 04:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
it's sent out by increasing the base
 
04:15:00.109 --> 04:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil to $12,000 you get a
 
04:15:03.309 --> 04:15:03.319 align:start position:0%
different change in tax rates until you
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
can match how the money in the education
 
04:15:09.149 --> 04:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
trust fund is going to be
 
04:15:11.670 --> 04:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
distributed you can't come up with exact
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:19.269 --> 04:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
Town H if you were the king how would
 
04:15:21.790 --> 04:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
you do it that we feel was Equitable and
 
04:15:24.269 --> 04:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
also would P be palatable to all these
 
04:15:26.910 --> 04:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
different uh taxing districts or
 
04:15:30.109 --> 04:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
different value districts if if I were a
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
member of the house
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
again which I'm I'm actually glad I'm
 
04:15:37.109 --> 04:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
not I don't think it to come in once
 
04:15:40.790 --> 04:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
maybe a year uh if if I were a member of
 
04:15:43.349 --> 04:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
the house I would say that special
 
04:15:45.950 --> 04:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
education is one of the biggest problems
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
in education in terms of funding because
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
highly expensive kids can move from one
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
town to the next town and then back to
 
04:15:56.469 --> 04:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
the town they were in and all of a
 
04:15:59.550 --> 04:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
sudden this sets off cycling of budgets
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
that makes no sense so I would find a
 
04:16:04.750 --> 04:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
way kind of an insurance policy that
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
every District pays into through its
 
04:16:11.109 --> 04:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax pays into the an
 
04:16:13.670 --> 04:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
insurance policy and that insurance
 
04:16:16.590 --> 04:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
policy just like fire insurance pays out
 
04:16:20.189 --> 04:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
where the need is um that would be one
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
thing I'd do that take about $800
 
04:16:23.520 --> 04:16:25.109 align:start position:0%
thing I'd do that take about $800
million

04:16:25.109 --> 04:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:16:28.030 --> 04:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
1.26 billion gives you another 400
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
million beyond the special ed so if it
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
were up to me I'd put 200 million of
 
04:16:36.990 --> 04:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
that into a homestead exemption for
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
everybody give them $100,000 of
 
04:16:43.309 --> 04:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
exemption on their primary residence
 
04:16:46.109 --> 04:16:46.119 align:start position:0%
so that the property tax rate paid by
 
04:16:48.790 --> 04:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
businesses and and vacation homes is
 
04:16:52.510 --> 04:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
different from that on a person's home I
 
04:16:55.590 --> 04:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
would do that and I might also increase
 
04:16:58.469 --> 04:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
the base cost per pupil by another $200
 
04:17:01.950 --> 04:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
million and see at the end how how does
 
04:17:05.309 --> 04:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
that look how do we feel about
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
that other
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
04:17:15.550 --> 04:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:31.990 --> 04:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.990 --> 04:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
Shen good afternoon my name is Zach
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
shien I'm the executive director of the
 
04:17:39.070 --> 04:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school funding fairness
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
project uh it's my first time in this
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
committee this year so for those of you
 
04:17:46.349 --> 04:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
who don't know um we're a nonprofit
 
04:17:49.349 --> 04:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
organization based here in conquered
 
04:17:51.149 --> 04:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
primary purpose of our organizations we
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
do a lot of educational activities
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
around the state talking about school
 
04:17:56.349 --> 04:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
funding property taxes some of the
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
history a lot of the stuff you've heard
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
today some of the potential policies
 
04:18:02.630 --> 04:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
Solutions um and then we follow a few
 
04:18:04.510 --> 04:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
bills each year that are related
 
04:18:07.870 --> 04:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
directly to school funding and property
 
04:18:10.510 --> 04:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
taxes um while that's being passed out
 
04:18:12.269 --> 04:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
um just a few pieces I want to highlight
 
04:18:14.189 --> 04:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
that have been said by previous uh
 
04:18:17.750 --> 04:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
speakers uh House Bill 669 would solve a
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
number of the kind of constitutional
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions being raised by the school
 
04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
funding lawsuit specifically the Rand
 
04:18:26.950 --> 04:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um that decision around the
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of swept is pending a
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
decision in the Supreme Court and as
 
04:18:32.990 --> 04:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
you've heard mentioned earlier uh could
 
04:18:36.149 --> 04:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
be coming down any day at this
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
point uh also um by changing it from the
 
04:18:42.429 --> 04:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
$363 million which is this locked kind
 
04:18:45.710 --> 04:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
of arbitrary rate um or amount to a rate
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
would uh make it more of a true tax that
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
could be adjusted would keep up with
 
04:18:52.349 --> 04:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
inflation changing
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
costs so what I've passed out um I
 
04:18:57.510 --> 04:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
didn't set it up like this I assumed
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
this is where the conversation would go
 
04:19:01.269 --> 04:19:01.279 align:start position:0%
I've kind of G taken a different
 
04:19:03.429 --> 04:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
approach I've given a hypothetical for
 
04:19:05.710 --> 04:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
what if this money raised by swept were
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
spent in a specific way so um what I did
 
04:19:11.910 --> 04:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
was we took two Bills currently being
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
heard in front of the house education
 
04:19:18.030 --> 04:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
funding committee uh House Bill uh 603
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 550 House Bill 603 um
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
would effectively pay for all special
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
education costs which actually um Doug
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
was just talking about about $800
 
04:19:29.389 --> 04:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
million so just all expenses we are
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
currently paying for for special
 
04:19:33.189 --> 04:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
education costs House Bill 603 would pay
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
for that house bill 550 would uh
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
effectively do the ruling in the con Val
 
04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um which is from the Superior
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
Court ruling back from November 2020 3
 
04:19:45.349 --> 04:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
um which would increase base adequacy
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's the amount going to every single
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
student in every school district from
 
04:19:52.590 --> 04:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
the 4100 and change it is now to the
 
04:19:55.309 --> 04:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
7356 in judge Ru off's ruing so
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
combining those two bills it's a little
 
04:19:59.109 --> 04:19:59.119 align:start position:0%
more than what this bill would rais but
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's about 1.3 billion right so what I
 
04:20:05.389 --> 04:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of show was what would be
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
if you took that money in through this
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
um House Bill
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
669 in a true Statewide tax tax at 5
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
per thousand and then you turned around
 
04:20:16.349 --> 04:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
and paired it with two bills that are
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
currently being considered that have
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
been proposed being considered in
 
04:20:21.870 --> 04:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
another committee and sent that money
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
back to
 
04:20:24.990 --> 04:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
communities and they didn't increase
 
04:20:27.109 --> 04:20:27.119 align:start position:0%
their school budgets right because this
 
04:20:28.309 --> 04:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
we're kind of talking about taxes what's
 
04:20:31.309 --> 04:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
the tax impact so if they increased
 
04:20:33.790 --> 04:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
their property tax rates that was paired
 
04:20:35.349 --> 04:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
with increased funding from the state in
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
the form of these two bills that
 
04:20:38.910 --> 04:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
increased fing the state they Ed to
 
04:20:41.189 --> 04:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
offset their local property taxes right
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
this is hypothetical right if I could
 
04:20:44.910 --> 04:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
wave a magic wand and have that be the
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
where it plays out which I think was
 
04:20:48.510 --> 04:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
some of the earlier questions the impact
 
04:20:50.590 --> 04:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
here you can see town by Town what the
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
overall school property tax impact would
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
be uh most school you know some high
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
level um pieces the median equalized
 
04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
value um equalized school property tax
 
04:21:03.109 --> 04:21:03.119 align:start position:0%
rate would decrease from currently it's
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
937 to
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
$811 um we'd see a shaving off of the
 
04:21:09.950 --> 04:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
the communities that pay the highest
 
04:21:12.070 --> 04:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
rate so no Community would have a
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
equalized school property tax rate
 
04:21:16.189 --> 04:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's state and local combined above
 
04:21:19.469 --> 04:21:19.479 align:start position:0%
$11 per thousand uh currently there are
 
04:21:22.030 --> 04:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
81 communities that pay more than $11
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
per thousand all the way up to $16.10
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
which is Brookline right now 172
 
04:21:29.309 --> 04:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
communities to see reduction 30
 
04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
communities would see an increase of
 
04:21:32.590 --> 04:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
under a dollar per thousand so there
 
04:21:33.670 --> 04:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
would be some communities that see an
 
04:21:36.070 --> 04:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
increase the vast majority would see a
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
decrease we'd really shave off the top
 
04:21:41.469 --> 04:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
um the highest tax rate districts to
 
04:21:44.229 --> 04:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
pull them down from that 16,000 dollar
 
04:21:46.349 --> 04:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
per thousand to under
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
11 um obviously this is a hypothetical
 
04:21:50.910 --> 04:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
but I try to use very real numbers and
 
04:21:54.030 --> 04:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
data from two other school funding bills
 
04:21:55.990 --> 04:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
um just to kind of give a sense of right
 
04:21:58.189 --> 04:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
where this could go if paired with other
 
04:21:58.199 --> 04:21:58.950 align:start position:0%
where this could go if paired with other
uh

04:21:58.950 --> 04:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:22:00.870 --> 04:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
elements a few more points I want to
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
make and then I'm happy to answer any
 
04:22:03.990 --> 04:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions about this um you know what I
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
provided here or the bill in general um
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
I just want to
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
reiterate um that the you know the 50th
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
in the country piece is is the state
 
04:22:15.149 --> 04:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
share and so what I'm kind of modeling
 
04:22:17.790 --> 04:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
is what if we shifted without increasing
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
the size of the pi for total education
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
spending right so still about $4 billion
 
04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
do what if we shifted some of that
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility from local property
 
04:22:28.349 --> 04:22:28.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to the state right so that we
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
were no longer a 50th in the country but
 
04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
as represent Smith pointed out somewhere
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the middle right and that's kind of
 
04:22:35.429 --> 04:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
what I'm showing here in that shift not
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
an increase in public education spending
 
04:22:41.229 --> 04:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
in particular um another Point around
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
concerns um around increasing property
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
taxes for some of the communities that
 
04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
would not see an offset in the model
 
04:22:50.790 --> 04:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
I've laid out we have other mechanisms
 
04:22:52.590 --> 04:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
um Doug just mentioned a hom set
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
exemption there's also the low and
 
04:22:55.630 --> 04:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
moderate property tax relief program
 
04:22:56.950 --> 04:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure all of you are familiar
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
with that we currently have in statute
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
that we basically just don't fund right
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
that is an active program that we have
 
04:23:05.550 --> 04:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
that provides property tax relief for
 
04:23:08.590 --> 04:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
people in the state on their swept that
 
04:23:10.030 --> 04:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
we don't put enough money into and the
 
04:23:11.349 --> 04:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
limits are so low that it's not really
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
an accessible fund that average rebates
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
about $200 so that could be another idea
 
04:23:17.790 --> 04:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
for making sure that individuals in the
 
04:23:19.590 --> 04:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
communities that might see a tax
 
04:23:22.229 --> 04:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
increase would um have the the rebate
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
and the relief there so their total tax
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
bill would uh would not change based on
 
04:23:26.399 --> 04:23:27.590 align:start position:0%
bill would uh would not change based on
their

04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
income um the last piece I guess I would
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
want to make is just a comment that was
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
made by representative McGuire around
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
effectively money not having an impact
 
04:23:38.590 --> 04:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
on school outcomes um that is not a
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
settled statement that is actually
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
highly disputed and there's a lot of
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
evidence that shows that money does
 
04:23:46.349 --> 04:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
impact outcomes and opportunities for
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
students especially when taking into
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
account specific needs like to his point
 
04:23:52.189 --> 04:23:52.199 align:start position:0%
if you're coming from a low-income
 
04:23:53.469 --> 04:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
background we know that in general
 
04:23:54.750 --> 04:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
students from low-income background
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
struggle and we also know that when we
 
04:23:59.229 --> 04:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
have money invested in communities or in
 
04:24:00.750 --> 04:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
school districts with higher proportions
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
of students with low income it has a
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
huge impact and return on investment to
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
kind of use that language so plenty of
 
04:24:08.189 --> 04:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
evidence out there to show that money
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
does matter and especially when you
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
target it in a specific way um such as
 
04:24:14.070 --> 04:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
special education needs or for students
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
coming from lowincome uh backgrounds so
 
04:24:18.109 --> 04:24:18.119 align:start position:0%
those a few of those points happy to
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about the bill or
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
anything um I've handed out here
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
today any questions from the
 
04:24:28.229 --> 04:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:36.750 --> 04:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
you the last pin card I have is uh uh
 
04:24:39.830 --> 04:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
Bruce from Dr if we have does anyone
 
04:24:46.710 --> 04:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for being
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
here is there else to do is there anyone
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
else that wishes to
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
testify on this
 
04:24:59.870 --> 04:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none I'll close the public
 
04:25:03.349 --> 04:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:06.950 --> 04:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
669 okay that concludes uh today's
 
04:25:06.960 --> 04:25:07.950 align:start position:0%
669 okay that concludes uh today's
public

04:25:07.950 --> 04:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
hearings um before anyone leaves um we
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
want we're gonna hear from Chris Shay
 
04:25:17.229 --> 04:25:17.239 align:start position:0%
who's got a whole bundle of information
 
04:26:11.229 --> 04:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:54.670 --> 04:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
so um Chris if you'd like to explain
 
04:27:56.189 --> 04:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
I'll just go through real quick with you
 
04:27:58.670 --> 04:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
so the there's two documents the one
 
04:28:01.950 --> 04:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
that's uh dated February 12 2025 final
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
is basically a completion of the
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
document you've been seeing each day up
 
04:28:07.830 --> 04:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
until today so it doesn't have the
 
04:28:09.950 --> 04:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
splits in it it's just the everything
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
combined um a little bit easier some
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes to look at when you're trying
 
04:28:16.309 --> 04:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
to look at the numbers the second one is
 
04:28:18.510 --> 04:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
the um document that provides the
 
04:28:21.109 --> 04:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
general fund education trust fund split
 
04:28:23.229 --> 04:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
and if you go to page five you can start
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
to see that um under columns a b and c
 
04:28:28.429 --> 04:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
there's your business taxes column A is
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
the general fund portion of that uh the
 
04:28:33.429 --> 04:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
column B is the education trust fund and
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
then column C is the total of the two
 
04:28:39.070 --> 04:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
that column C you should find in the
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
other report I
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
referenced um
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
so and that's how this goes through um
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
for each of those pieces or those taxes
 
04:28:50.550 --> 04:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
that um are split which do include your
 
04:28:53.950 --> 04:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
business taxes meals and rooms tobacco
 
04:28:56.030 --> 04:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
R and meals and
 
04:28:58.349 --> 04:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
rooms I did say meals and rooms so got
 
04:28:58.359 --> 04:29:01.630 align:start position:0%
rooms I did say meals and rooms so got
twice

04:29:01.630 --> 04:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:04.229 --> 04:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
um nothing new here other than the
 
04:29:14.830 --> 04:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:17.670 --> 04:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
that just provides you um the total so
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
column AC is the total as you've been
 
04:29:22.269 --> 04:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
seeing all along and then if you turn to
 
04:29:27.109 --> 04:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
page 10 you'll see the totals by funding
 
04:29:29.910 --> 04:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
source so you'll see that column A is
 
04:29:33.030 --> 04:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
the general fund portion of your Revenue
 
04:29:35.870 --> 04:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the total that you've
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
estimated for each of those years and
 
04:29:42.030 --> 04:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
then the um AE is the total for theed
 
04:29:44.510 --> 04:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and then again
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
another total total that combines the
 
04:29:47.990 --> 04:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
two so you can just see that everything
 
04:29:51.189 --> 04:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
foots and ties um I
 
04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
think just to point out because I was
 
04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
listening to your the testimony that was
 
04:29:58.030 --> 04:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
going on and um represent Maguire who
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
has not seen these figures yet um
 
04:30:03.710 --> 04:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
suggested the education trust fund is uh
 
04:30:06.070 --> 04:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
flushed with cash and we should end the
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
year with about $100
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
million um that was correct until you
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
guys finalized your estimate and if you
 
04:30:16.349 --> 04:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
look at um row
 
04:30:20.670 --> 04:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
seven in column AE you got 1. 1283
 
04:30:23.910 --> 04:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
billion and then you look at row 10
 
04:30:26.670 --> 04:30:26.680 align:start position:0%
column AE it drops to
 
04:30:29.950 --> 04:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
1.89 billion so this you know almost a
 
04:30:33.070 --> 04:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
hundred million drop that will eat up
 
04:30:34.830 --> 04:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
any surplus that's remaining in the
 
04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so I I just just
 
04:30:40.109 --> 04:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
showing you how important the numbers
 
04:30:42.189 --> 04:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
are that you're coming up with and how
 
04:30:44.550 --> 04:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
this will be um probably looked at when
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
the other members start to see this
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
um so that that's it generally thank you
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
Chris where's the um uh that's the
 
04:30:57.670 --> 04:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so the education
 
04:31:01.710 --> 04:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
trust fund that one you know column AE
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
line row 10 you're saying
 
04:31:10.149 --> 04:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
1.89 represents your estimate no I
 
04:31:12.109 --> 04:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
understand but basically a break even
 
04:31:13.950 --> 04:31:13.960 align:start position:0%
based on the way things are
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
tracking right it it would drain the um
 
04:31:19.469 --> 04:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
potential Surplus that was in the
 
04:31:22.149 --> 04:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so as as was
 
04:31:25.950 --> 04:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned to the committee um the in
 
04:31:28.269 --> 04:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
2023 when you looked at the Surplus
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
statement that we had at that time there
 
04:31:31.830 --> 04:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
was an estimate there would be
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
approximately $230 million in the
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
education trust fund by the end of
 
04:31:40.429 --> 04:31:40.439 align:start position:0%
20125 that has been um decreasing each
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
year partly because the revenues aren't
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
coming in on that side of the equation
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
as strong as they um should have or
 
04:31:50.750 --> 04:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
could have as well as um some some of
 
04:31:52.750 --> 04:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
the funding that comes out of the
 
04:31:55.469 --> 04:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
education trust f for things
 
04:31:59.189 --> 04:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
adequacy um Charter Schools efas all
 
04:32:03.149 --> 04:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
which have um an open warrant ability so
 
04:32:05.189 --> 04:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
that because they're all estimates the
 
04:32:07.670 --> 04:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
ability to make sure that these three
 
04:32:09.750 --> 04:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
areas pay for the children that they are
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to pay for so the commission
 
04:32:14.349 --> 04:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
has an open warrant to take care of that
 
04:32:15.790 --> 04:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
so you've seen some adjustments each
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
year related to that um but I just again
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention it because I I
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
heard it in the last public hearing
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
um just at any opportunity we can get to
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
message that just so people understand
 
04:32:32.670 --> 04:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
that um we may not be as flush with
 
04:32:35.950 --> 04:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
money as we were you know a year ago or
 
04:32:38.229 --> 04:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
even maybe six months
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
ago okay so then if we look at column A
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
on page 10 yep
 
04:32:45.760 --> 04:32:49.790 align:start position:0%
on page 10 yep
um

04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
ad I know now I'm asking a question
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
about the general fund um
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
so row seven is the official plan yes
 
04:33:02.349 --> 04:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
sir row 10 is our estimate um so
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
obviously our estimate is about 62
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
million below the plan where are we
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
tracking on that one right now
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.429 --> 04:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
had was Nor it was north of $25 million
 
04:33:28.670 --> 04:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
deficit in general funds okay um I can't
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
remember the exact amount but we we
 
04:33:35.189 --> 04:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
update it um every 30 days or so yeah I
 
04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
think that's I think I do remember that
 
04:33:39.429 --> 04:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
so so what you you've heard um is that
 
04:33:41.230 --> 04:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
the governor has you know has a hiring
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
free she issued an executive order to do
 
04:33:46.029 --> 04:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
hiring free so that's one way that the
 
04:33:48.590 --> 04:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
executive um the governor's taking care
 
04:33:49.990 --> 04:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
of the executive branch and trying to
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
control some of the U potential
 
04:33:55.510 --> 04:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
shortfall in the general fund um there
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
may be other things that are occurring
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
or will occur in the next few months um
 
04:34:06.789 --> 04:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
but it it is something to be keeping an
 
04:34:08.869 --> 04:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
eye on you know going forward and and
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
you know for finance committee as they
 
04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
start their work you know that's
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
something something that Mike Kane will
 
04:34:15.910 --> 04:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
um continually be reminding them of is
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
you know status of where we are um or
 
04:34:22.150 --> 04:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
anticipated where we are
 
04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and then the last couple Pages
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
again are the highway fund and the
 
04:34:27.230 --> 04:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
fishing game fund you guys completed
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
those the other day they haven't
 
04:34:33.029 --> 04:34:33.039 align:start position:0%
changed um I will put these documents on
 
04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
um our web page I didn't do that yet in
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
case there was some issue or concern
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.949 --> 04:35:06.959 align:start position:0%
yes yes yeah I I caught it when I was
 
04:35:08.189 --> 04:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
sitting in
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:17.230 --> 04:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
not a big deal no I I appreciate that I
 
04:35:18.670 --> 04:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
I did catch it when I was sitting there
 
04:35:20.349 --> 04:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
and I'd already printed the copy so I
 
04:35:21.820 --> 04:35:21.830 align:start position:0%

04:35:31.750 --> 04:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
Yep this is two mistakes in two days I
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%

04:35:36.670 --> 04:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
older and huge
 
04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%

04:36:52.269 --> 04:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
resolution that's correct so if the
 
04:36:53.949 --> 04:36:53.959 align:start position:0%
committee is okay with what they've been
 
04:36:55.551 --> 04:36:55.561 align:start position:0%
presented today and they want me to move
 
04:36:58.629 --> 04:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
forward I'll go do that yeah I mean I
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
looked at it last night I didn't see
 
04:37:02.029 --> 04:37:02.039 align:start position:0%
anything different than what we um
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
agreed to yesterday but if somebody has
 
04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
different thoughts you know let us know

but um yeah so at this
 
04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
point baring any last minute changes I
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
