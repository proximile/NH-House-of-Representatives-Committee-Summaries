sure remembers we had two hearings on it
 
00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
uh the original form of the bill I think
 
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
everybody had some issues with and so an
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
amendment was brought in um that was
 
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
considerably more
 
00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:15.759 align:start position:0%
reasonable however uh what we learned
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
during the second public hearing is that
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
um the university system both the
 
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
community colleges and UNH were amenable
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
to satisfying the goals that were set
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
forth in that
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment and um it seems that we're on
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
a path where they could accomplish uh
 
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
everything that's intended without
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
actually having to
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
um push it through in in legislation and
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
when we can do something directly with
 
00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
the Departments rather than pass
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that's generally
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
preferable and so for that reason um I'm
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
asking for an
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
itl and you know we can wait and see
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
what kind of progress is made and maybe
 
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
revisit it sometime in the future if
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
it's unsatis fact thank you
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
L seeing none comments online
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
representative kill yes uh thank you Mr
 
00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:29.790 align:start position:0%
representative kill yes uh thank you Mr
chair

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
and I would agree with uh the remarks
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
from the um Vice chair uh it is
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
encouraging that the both the university
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
and the uh community college system were
 
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
willing to uh uh comply with the with
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
the goal of making the compensation
 
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
available and you know for adjunct as
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
well as uh full-time faculty I think we
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
can see from the actions of the uh
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
finance committee taking $30 million out
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
of uh the Governor's School
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund to put put it to
 
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
shore up the uh University and the co
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
community college system that were going
 
00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
to be funded but at least flat funding
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
them which is kind of flat funding is
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
about all we do here in New Hampshire
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
when we when we're not having enough
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
money going into either system which is
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
why we export so many young people to
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
out of state universities because the
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
tuition is cheaper and they don't come
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
back so I think we we do uh we do hope
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
to uh perhaps s sort out the business
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
maybe there'll be a merger maybe there
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
won't but we want to make sure that
 
00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:31.959 align:start position:0%
we're paying faculty uh to do the work
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
that they're doing to the important work
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
of educating our students thank you Mr
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative kahill
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
yes and representative kahill you um
 
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
have the video now uh on uh on YouTube
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
where the
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember uh the chancellor or
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
the woman's name the president of the
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
community college system when I asked
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
her specifically will you provide this
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
information and she agreed to do that
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
and we already know the university
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
system information is available so um
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
let the labor committee know if uh that
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
information is not provided to you when
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
you request it thank you Mr chair it was
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
good to see that a uh solution hopefully
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
um could come of this um with people
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
participating and cooperating versus
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
having a piece of legislation any
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%

much I'm going to close the hearing
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
executive session on Hospital 501 and I
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a few announcements for the
 
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee there was a request made to
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
place House Bill
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
107 um which was the increase in the
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
minimum wage of $22.50 cents on the
 
00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
consent agenda as inexpedient to
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
legislate when I requested by the when I
 
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
made the request um by the uh or to the
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
house clerk he informed me this could
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
not be be done because it had already
 
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
appeared in the in a calendar um so we
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
will have to bring it to the floor I'll
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
be it briefly even understanding that
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
some of the sponsors and the committee
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
uh would have liked to uh changed their
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
mind and would have liked to have seen
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
it on the um on the Cent agenda that not
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
happen um by rule and our protocol so um
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
it will be on the house floor and I
 
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
believe neither side will speak but that
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
is the ruling of the the
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
clerk um the second issue that came up
 
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
was we had the bill uh Michael please
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
remind me he's at 589 FN regarding y um
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
prophylactic use or
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
approval 589 the um we had retained that
 
00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:52.509 align:start position:0%
approval 589 the um we had retained that
bill

00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
here and
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
um then uh representative kahill and I
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
along along with Department of Labor
 
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.749 align:start position:0%
along along with Department of Labor
went

00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
went
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
through the initial bill the
 
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.870 align:start position:0%
through the initial bill the
amendment

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
um agreed with the what was intended
 
00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
what the amendment did what the process
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
was I then wrote to each one of you with
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
five attachments an
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
outline of how to follow the bill and
 
00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:22.839 align:start position:0%
what was done and what was intended and
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
I believe u I did not receive any
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
dissenting opinions on what I was
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
presented I then requested that the
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
clerk allow us to bring the retain Bill
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
back into the committee so we could vote
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
on it again that is not
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
allowed technically on the house
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
floor we could do
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
that the clerk recommended and requested
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
that we not really do that because
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
having so many bills being retained and
 
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
with the marathon session we have to
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
have on the 7th 8th and 9th of April um
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
they did not want to get in a situation
 
00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:11.759 align:start position:0%
where all retained bills came out on the
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
floor it had been done 18 years ago in
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
one certain circumstance it was relay to
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
me that it was an extremely
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
important uh to the entire State and
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's why that was done that way so I
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
then uh discussed with representative k
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
Hill about trying to find a Germain bill
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
either in the house or the
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
Senate to attach it
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
to um uh there was nothing in the Senate
 
00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
that that represent kill could find I
 
00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519 align:start position:0%
was looking for it I'm still looking for
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
something to do that then the request
 
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
was made um to attach it to one of our
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
existing pieces of legislation out of
 
00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
this committee which would have been
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
305 which can only be done on the
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
floor um I I passed that around um and
 
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.160 align:start position:0%
there was not on um Republican caucus
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
of interest in doing
 
00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:21.269 align:start position:0%
of interest in doing
so

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:25.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 589 but some because of the bill
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
305 which apparently um is
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
not being received over well
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly by the entire
 
00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
house um if also
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
the a mass amount of bills that we
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
have it was recommended that we not do
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
this so that is the circumstance where
 
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
now um I'm open for discussion and
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
further representative Adent has been
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you ch you may speak um I
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
would I mean I'd recommend just pulling
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
it out on the FLT you know like I know
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
you said there's not a huge appetite for
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
that because it'll unleash this wave of
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
a bunch of bills coming out on the floor
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
as much as I would love all the retained
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
bills from various committees this year
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
come out on the house floor there's not
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
votes for that so if this one does I
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
think it would be an isolated
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
incid M um uh it is the um all right I I
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
will let everyone speak before I make my
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
comments um thank you for your comments
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't think of I was trying to
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
say you will recognize to speak my
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
apologies it's early we're just getting
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
started anyone else here in the
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
L seeing no comments here any
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
online representative kill thank you Mr
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
chair uh yeah in in light of the uh
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances while I while I believe
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee would
 
00:17:58.149 --> 00:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
support uh 589 now that they all
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
understand what it does and what it
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't do I don't want to uh I don't
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
want to sync the other Bill 385 which is
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
also important to protect our you know
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
long serving uh firefighters so I I
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
think that the best thing to do at this
 
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
time would be to to wait till next year
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately another year on this issue
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
but I think that's the best uh plan
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
forward not not being one to remonstrate
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
but we do spend a lot of time on the
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
floor talking about talking about silly
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes and this is not a silly one
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
but uh let's just uh take the better
 
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
path of Valor and uh we wait till next
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
year and hopefully nobody else uh has
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
this unfortunate
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
experience thank you representative
 
00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
kahill representative
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
Sol thank you Mr chair um I have to
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
agree with my colleague rep kahill um
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
that um this bill would have a much
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
better chance coming up clean and Alone
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
um in the next U session uh rather than
 
00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
than um having a what could be a fairly
 
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240 align:start position:0%
confusing floor action um in the um
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
Sports plex so umun we have to wait but
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
I think that's the best course of action
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.789 --> 00:19:21.799 align:start position:0%
comments well I agree with what you
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
would like with representative kahill
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I am still
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
trying to find something uh through the
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
senate or Commerce Committee to see what
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
we can do I do believe it is ready to go
 
00:19:36.029 --> 00:19:36.039 align:start position:0%
and it's and and it's something that um
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
probably should be
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:43.029 align:start position:0%
 
cannot

00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh tell any Representatives they cannot
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
do something on the floor I cannot tell
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
any of you you were you were forbidden
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
for making a motion on the floor you all
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
have your choice to do as you choose um
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
we just do want to get this uh bill pass
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
so I I will leave it at that unless
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'm G to come back at 10 minutes of 10
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%

00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
recog I will come back at 10 minutes of
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
10 and outline how we're going to handle
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
um today's hearing um on House Bill 61
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative Adent followed by
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative S I just wanted to follow
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
up on the last comment you made um I
 
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't planning on pulling it off in the
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
floor um because like I just think it
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
you know doesn't make a whole lot of
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
sense for us to get technicality the
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
cler's office but if it were to be
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
pulled out on the floor with the
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
amendment that you and representative
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
kill worked on the attached to the
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislation would have called off fled
 
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.170 align:start position:0%
legislation would have called off fled
on

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:02.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:07.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
FL lad I believe the bill would have to
 
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
FL lad I believe the bill would have to
come

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
out someone would have to move the
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
amendment the amendment would have to
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
pass then the the so would have to
 
00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:22.750 align:start position:0%
pass then the the so would have to
happen

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
that so first you'd have to get the
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
motion to bring it out then the motion
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
with then the amendment the first one
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
would be the first order of business on
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
that bill that one okay thank you
 
00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:36.710 align:start position:0%
that bill that one okay thank you

solivan as I said I think we would like
 
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
to avoid a confusing process on the
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
floor um with a lot of work to get done
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
um the um I also just wanted to say that
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
during our break I'd like to do a quick
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
um Democratic caucus um so we could sign
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
yesterday

00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
much we are going to mute the uh volume
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
here in the
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
lrv and I need to go through this to
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
determine the order of speaking because
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:50:38.589 align:start position:0%

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.440 --> 00:51:00.829 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:02.620 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:18.230 align:start position:0%

labor I am Senator John Reagan from
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
Senate District 17 and I bring to you
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
today Senate Bill
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
61 affectionately known as right to
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
work you have been bombarded with so
 
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.630 align:start position:0%
work you have been bombarded with so
much

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
information some of it is true and some
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
of it has proven ridiculously
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
false many union members believe they
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
are supporting co-workers by opposing
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
right to
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
work you often excuse the price of union
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
dues believing that they pay for
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys and business agents but often
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
they are used to influence political
 
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
elections the difficulty with being a
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
legislator is often trying to Divine
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
what is true and what is not
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
true we have all promised to do what is
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
best for all citizens of New
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this is
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
at least the fourth time that I've
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
introduced The Right to Work
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
bill but I believe that the numbers that
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
you have seen supporting economic
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
Advantage for
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
States enjoying Right to Work
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
protection to be true and that is why I
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
brought it back
 
01:02:52.829 --> 01:02:52.839 align:start position:0%
again and I think it makes New Hampshire
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
a more desirable place to do
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
business my session has started in the
 
01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:00.920 align:start position:0%
Senate so I am not going to take any
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
test any questions you'll have plenty of
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
input coming at
 
01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.870 align:start position:0%

judgment decide what is true and act in
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
the best interest of New
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%

Kaplan representing uh mayor Max 6 the
 
01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
I'm a 20 plus years public educator and
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
Union member and uh I can tell you one
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
of the things I've been most grateful
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
for as a father and husband and someone
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
committed to giving my kids the best
 
01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:10.039 align:start position:0%
possible advantage in life is uh
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
belonging to a union and to guarantee
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
decent wages job protections and health
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
care that come with working as a public
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
school teacher in a union covered
 
01:04:22.829 --> 01:04:22.839 align:start position:0%
workplace I remember going to hker town
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
meetings and people complaining about
 
01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
the teacher is getting a raise how come
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
I don't make that much how come I don't
 
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
get that level of Health
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
Care and I always responded that number
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
one the rise in school spending has very
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
little to do with teacher salaries but
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
more importantly why aren't we trying to
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
raise everyone up instead of tearing
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
some of us down every job and every
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
workplace should be adequately
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
compensated and one of the keys to
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
getting there is collective
 
01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
bargaining unions based on worker
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
solidarity and stick sing together to
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
get better conditions and wages are an
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
essential component of a prosperous
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
America that's what built the middle
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
class every student of American History
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
knows that for a fact the peak year of
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
union membership by percentage was
 
01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:13.240 align:start position:0%
1954 the 1950s and 60s were the years
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
that grew an American middle class that
 
01:05:16.829 --> 01:05:16.839 align:start position:0%
was the pride of the world with
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
prosperity never before
 
01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:21.799 align:start position:0%
seen Rising wages year after year in
 
01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
almost every sector and almost every
 
01:05:23.559 --> 01:05:25.190 align:start position:0%
almost every sector and almost every
demographic

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
and it was built on Union membership and
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing transport skilled and
 
01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.710 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing transport skilled and
unskilled

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
unskilled
 
01:05:34.269 --> 01:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
labor but the tide began to turn as it
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
does and the corporate Elites struck
 
01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
back with the Reagan
 
01:05:41.069 --> 01:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
Administration the great communicator
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
President Reagan who's really the
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
spokesman for this new but actually old
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
as the hills ideology that the rich and
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
their riches should be Unleashed and
 
01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
this would give rise to a new sort of
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
growth an Economy based on wealth
 
01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
trickling down from above instead of
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
growing out from an expanding middle
 
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
class part of that was breaking the
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
power of unions by deregulating and
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
opening up to globalization all designed
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
to increase the power of Corporations
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
and business profits but we've seen the
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
result the collapse of the American
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
middle class over the last few
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
decades and the rise of levels of
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
inequality last seen at the beginning of
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
the 20th century when we had cities
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
teaming with pennes immigrants and
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
Countryside full of Hard Scrabble Farms
 
01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
while the robber barons Rockefellers and
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
carnegies lived high off the Hog on
 
01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:32.029 align:start position:0%
carnegies lived high off the Hog on
their

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
Estates that's the level of inequality
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
we're living with
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
today today's average hourly W wage has
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
just about the same purchasing power it
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
did in
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
1978 following a long slide in the 80s
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
and 90s and bumpy inconsistent growth
 
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.910 align:start position:0%
and 90s and bumpy inconsistent growth
since

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
then in fact according to the Pew
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
Research Institute in real terms average
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
hourly earnings be more than 45 years
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
ago in January
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
1973 that's the context for the right to
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
work laws or Right to Work For Less laws
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
that have been passed in 27
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
States they are a legacy of the ideology
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
of liberal free market economics that
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
taught that freeing up Capital to do its
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
thing would shower us with unprecedented
 
01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:15.799 align:start position:0%
riches well it hasn't worked out that
 
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
way as we've seen so-called right to
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
work laws are what happens when the rich
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
and Powerful begin to consolidate their
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
gains through taking over the political
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
system it would help guarantee for the
 
01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
businesses that run the American economy
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
a permanent underclass a new American
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
proletarian unable to push back against
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
the tide of inequality and dependent on
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
government for any protections that it
 
01:07:39.279 --> 01:07:40.269 align:start position:0%
government for any protections that it
could

01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
seek and why would we want this in New
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this has nothing to do with
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Advantage the New
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage isn't about racing
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
bottom why would you race to the bottom
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
when you're not near the bottom already
 
01:07:58.029 --> 01:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire economy is pretty good
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
we've got one of the lowest unemployment
 
01:08:02.589 --> 01:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
levels in the country with median wages
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
just above the national average why
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
would we want to enact this legislation
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
when we can see the results in the 27
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
states that we have the economic policy
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
Institute attributes so-called right to
 
01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
work laws with a 3% decline in wages for
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
Union and non-union workers and states
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
that have passed these laws 24% of jobs
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
in 2019 were in low-wage occupations on
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
almost a quarter jobs compared to 14%
 
01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
low wage jobs in states without
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
so-called right to work
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
laws we don't want or need more low-wage
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
jobs here our low wage workers are
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
already struggling as it is with wages
 
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
that don't meet their needs in housing
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
food and other Basics that's not the New
 
01:08:44.349 --> 01:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage the New Hampshire
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
Advantage is not about reducing people
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
to beggy what we need in New Hampshire
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
is the ability for low wage workers to
 
01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
enact Improvement in their lives through
 
01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:54.759 align:start position:0%
forming a union and bargaining with
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
their employers whether it's Amazon or
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
Walmart or a grocery store chain and as
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
we bring back Manufacturing in new
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
sectors whether it's high-tech
 
01:09:06.669 --> 01:09:06.679 align:start position:0%
bioengineering or offshore wind these
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
new skilled workers in these industries
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
will see better and faster gains if they
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
are able to bargain collectively with
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
their employers to provide the kind of
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
jobs with guaranteed wages that our
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
state needs to become a place where
 
01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
everyone can Thrive not just survive
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
so-called right to work laws are not
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
about anyone's Freedom you're not free
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
to Sher your responsibility as a citizen
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
so why should you be free to Sher your
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a worker to your
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
fellow workers when you're covered by a
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement workers
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
in a union workplace who don't want to
 
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
become full members of a union are
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
already protected by the National Labor
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
Relations Act and can choose that path
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
but with this law it makes free writing
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
on the backs of a collective bargaining
 
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
process out as something Noble when in
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
fact it is simply
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
destructive so I urge you
 
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
representatives to look at this bill for
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
what it is not what it sounds like it's
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
an attack on our prosperity and on our
 
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
ability to build a sustainable economy
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%

01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%

actually read sb61 when it came over um
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm uh what I'm opposed to in the
 
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill is some of the specific language I
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
did send an email last night with an
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
amendment and legislative Services just
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh this morning sent an updated version
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
of that email with a correcting a typo
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
so I I've sent that along as a uh
 
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.070 align:start position:0%
so I I've sent that along as a uh
Amendment

01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
107h um but I just wanted to highlight a
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
couple of of Provisions that have been
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
added in
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
um absolutely not opposed I absolutely
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
support voluntary unionization and I I
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
not against the a simpler Michigan style
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
right to work law however uh Senate Bill
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
61 contains a lot of additional
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
Provisions that shouldn't be included in
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
right to work um proposal to the house
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh one is it in proposed uh RSA
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
273- d section 4 um it probably the wor
 
01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
provision which would uh is part five
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
which is added in which would prevent
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
contractors from being able to use a uh
 
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
labor union exclusively for their hiring
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of companies um rather than going
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
to a temp agency prefer to go to a union
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
shop um and those unions usually um
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
either require or recommend or offer
 
01:12:17.189 --> 01:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
some type of discount on mandate
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
contributions uh in exchange for going
 
01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
through them exclusively private
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
companies and Manning agencies are
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to do I don't see any reason why
 
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
uh a trade Union shouldn't be allowed to
 
01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
um and more important than that is
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
companies are facing Rising liability
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
costs and hiring through a union is is
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
um hiring exclusively through a union is
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
a way to uh greatly cut down on that
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
cost I talked to a small business owner
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
who was paying $2,000 a month on in
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
insurance I think he had only one
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
employee um and big part of that was
 
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
liability um that was for you know
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
hiring and discrimination and harassment
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh coverage uh another one is uh
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
dsection 5 um which
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
includes uh a an unfunded mandate saying
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
every employer who receives such an
 
01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
authorization from an employee shall
 
01:13:14.629 --> 01:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
have a duty to promptly notify the
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
employee in writing that the employee
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
May revoke an authorization at any time
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
by giving the employer 30 days written
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
notice um that presumes it there will be
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
forms printed out the problem with some
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
of these these provisions and also in
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
section 7 the uh the notice to be posted
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
is that a lot of job sites es both Union
 
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
and non-union are are traveling I work
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
in road construction and we go from
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
bridge to highway to overpass and go
 
01:13:43.229 --> 01:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
over a mile or two mile of roads in a
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
single night and um it's not practical
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
in some cases to Simply you know bring a
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
bullt and board along or it's not
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
possible in some cases to to post this
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
in a a prominent location it's a it's a
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of a an aggravation I think
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
it it would just cause unnecessary
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
problems for employers um there's
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
another provision in in in section six
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
that says that uh uh the union couldn't
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
authorize a boycott well a boycott
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
usually refers to purchasing um we just
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
accept the right to boycott a
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
company um as consumers is is just a
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
choice that we have so I I I didn't
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
that so I proposed uh in the amendment
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
pulling that out also um the penalties
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
it um some states have this 90day jail
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
penalty but the way it's applied in this
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill um if you have a subcontractor who
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
is required to move under a
 
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
grandfathered clo shop contract they
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
would have to sign into that clo shop
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
contract but this bill takes effect
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
immediately takes effect upon passage so
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
any subcontractor who was forced to go
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
who had to as necessity of the job to go
 
01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
under the Union's jurisdiction and had
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
to sign into that same existing labor
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
contract uh would then be in Jeopardy of
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
a $1,000 fine um imprisonment not
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
exceeding 90 days or both and a
 
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.790 align:start position:0%
exceeding 90 days or both and a
misdemeanor

01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
conviction um I I think that that's kind
 
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
of excessive and I don't see that
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in contract law um section
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
11 duty to investigate it it becomes
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
another mandate on the Attorney
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
General's office and on every County
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
attorney would have to investigate every
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
single complaint um even if it seems
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
like a spous complaint um and shall
 
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
prosecute all persons violating all uh
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
any of its Provisions that
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
changes uh right to work which is
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
normally a civil cause of action it
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
would change it into effectively
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
criminal law um and it it's again it
 
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
would it seems to violate separation of
 
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
powers because it it it takes away the
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
discretion that prosecutors have to
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that many of the case cases
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
and violations they have are trivial and
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
not worth uh uh going forward with or
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
they may not have sufficient amount of
 
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh of uh uh evidence to go forward and
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
and obtain uh a grand jury indictment or
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh criminal charges against someone and
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
they would have to take the case to
 
01:16:14.910 --> 01:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
trial anyway um and finally the
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
effective date um this act shall take
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
effect upon passage in my Amendment um
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.629 align:start position:0%
effect upon passage in my Amendment um
17h

01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
17h
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
107h uh usually when we have bills
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
especially coming through Commerce and
 
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County we have them take
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
effect January of next year where
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
possible so that we can go through the
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment period and ensure that there
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
aren't any conflicts with other bills
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
that have been passed this session there
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be one with s
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
sp61 uh but the Department of Labor and
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
other agencies uh would have to update
 
01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
their forms and they need a certain
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
amount of time to do that and it's more
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
efficient to just do that uh after the
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
session is over and update all their
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
Forms and Publications um at the end of
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
the year so
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
um the the biggest issue is that we have
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of members who've committed to
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
supporting a Right to Work bill that's
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
known and understood in other states um
 
01:17:13.790 --> 01:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
I think TW what did they say 27 other
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
states have already enacted a a simpler
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
Right to Work bill U now the Senate has
 
01:17:20.629 --> 01:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
has come forward with a version that
 
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
contains a lot of additional language
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
that probably shouldn't be in law might
 
01:17:28.629 --> 01:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
be unconstitutional and may cause um
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
other enforcement problems and may uh
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
throw the entire proposed law into the
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
courts and subject them to
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
various um uh legal challenges that
 
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
could that could put the state in a bit
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
of a quagmire so my preference is UHS
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
could you could you wrap it up please my
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
preference is just to put a well-known
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
Michigan style right to work law in
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
front of the house and let the members
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
decide it uh something that's better
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
understood thank you very much are there
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%

01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%

representative a I ask everyone to try
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%

01:18:17.709 --> 01:18:17.719 align:start position:0%
minutes please representative Horgan
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Perez
 
01:18:23.629 --> 01:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
followed by uh beter and Becket
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative Horan are you with us
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
um yes hopefully I'm unmuted um so my
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
name is Timothy Horan I represent
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
straford County district 6 the towns of
 
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
Durham and Madbury and um I I'd like to
 
01:18:39.229 --> 01:18:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank the uh member from sebr for his
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
presentation he pointed out many many
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
things that are wrong with the bill so
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
even if you like the bill there's a lot
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
of flaws with the way it's uh way it's
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
implemented and I certainly don't like
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
the bills it's just like one flaw
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
interesting flaw big about boycotting
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
boycotting is just the act of not buying
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
something and
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's totally impossible
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
to prove why it is you're not buying
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
anything like like for example I used to
 
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
buy lots of Goya baked beans Goya beans
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
until the CEO made some statements that
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
I hated but hard to prove like why I did
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
it I just decided to start buying other
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
cans of beans but anyway get back to my
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony which I sent you uh
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
last night and most of you appear to
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
have read so this is a so-called write
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
to Work bill but that phrase is a misn
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
number work is privilege not a right now
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
certainly workers do have rights but
 
01:19:28.750 --> 01:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
this bill does nothing to protect those
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
rights in fact it makes it harder for
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
workers to act collectively to defend
 
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
their rights um pointing out something
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
else that's wrong with that the Des of
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
labor organization is so broad it takes
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
in you know even things like the
 
01:19:41.629 --> 01:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
Committees that probably just about any
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
organization with more than uh four
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
three or four employees has to hear from
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
the employers employees concerns you
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
know even that something like that's
 
01:19:52.030 --> 01:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
illegal but it's clearly it's directed
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
primarily at labor unions we all know
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
that and labor unions are less powerful
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
now than really any time in several
 
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
decades but still fast the blame union
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
bosses for all the ills of society I'm
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
only have to go no further than
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
Governor's press conferences where he
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
complains like every week about the
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
teachers union and the union bosses you
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
for um so so um and then on the other
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
hand carpet Executives they're revered
 
01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
almost as if they were Gods you know
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
they're almost like considered
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
infallible but um unions are not perfect
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not infallible the people
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
who run them are certainly not perfect
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I I I've met a lot of them my years
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
as rep most of them are pretty good
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
people um but all institutions are run
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
by you know imperfect people um people
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
in charge of labor unions are in fact
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
more accountable the members than the
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
people run just about any other
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
institution fact even including the one
 
01:20:45.149 --> 01:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
that we all belong to the New Hampshire
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
house um you know their leaders are
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
elected by their members every Union
 
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
routinely offers many opportunities for
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
members to participate um most locals
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
have more work than the volunteers who
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
are currently working to do they always
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
welcome more people helping out and even
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
though most incompetent union leaders
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
are keenly aware that their members can
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
leave at any time you know anybody can
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
quit their job um even the case of Union
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
shops where all workers required to pay
 
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.719 align:start position:0%
a fee to the union each and every
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
individual workers always free to seek
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
another job we have the right to quit
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
and there is no profession where
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
unionized employees totally monopolize a
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
job Market I would say even the lowest
 
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
paid quote unquote unskilled low skilled
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
worker is a professional like um just
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
about every job is difficult a working
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
person who objects to even a tangential
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
involvement in Union can always seek
 
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
employment with a non-union employer um
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
usually and almost always in the same
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
profession they've been doing all along
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
just with a different employer um the
 
01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
vast majority cases however would be
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
foolish to quit a union job to seek a
 
01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
non-union job since just to get away
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
from the union at at least because
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
non-un jobs pay less have fewer benefits
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
and offer worse working conditions or
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
probably put it more positively a union
 
01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
job pay more have more benefits and
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
offer better working conditions um small
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
amount of money deducted for Union user
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
agency fees is vastly outweighed by the
 
01:22:11.669 --> 01:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
advantages of working a union job so
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
even though there is no right to work
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
there is as I already said always has
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
been the right to quit um all this bills
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
make it harder for workers who love
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
their job to work together make sure
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
they're treated fairly and paid what
 
01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
they're paid what they're worth um so
 
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
and also speaking of the right to quick
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
we we heard about the low unemployment
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
rate we do have a strong labor market
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but one of the
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
reasons that is there's a lot of workers
 
01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
who aren't participating in the labor
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
force I think part of it is because
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
working conditions are people don't
 
01:22:41.709 --> 01:22:41.719 align:start position:0%
trust employers so we had more unionized
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
jobs there would be uh we would have
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
workers have more leverage over their
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
employers so I think um this bill is uh
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
well site the fact it does a very bad
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
job of doing what it sets out to do is
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
represent remember from CBR app pointed
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
out but the thing that it sets out to do
 
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
is uh is um not worth doing in the first
 
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
place so the whole thing is unnecessary
 
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to just uh itl the bill
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
even though I I certainly thank him for
 
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
the work he did on the amendment so um
 
01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's basically it that's basically
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
what I say B what I have to say I'd be
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%

01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
the rights of the workers this is taking

McCain beter and I am executive director
 
01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
of New England citizens for right to
 
01:26:02.189 --> 01:26:02.199 align:start position:0%
work on behalf of our tens of thousands
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
members and supporters I'm here to speak
 
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
in support of Senate Bill 61 and the
 
01:26:09.629 --> 01:26:09.639 align:start position:0%
freedom of Association that it advances
 
01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would protect every individual
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
from being compelled to pay union dues
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
or fees in order to work for a living
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
finally making New Hampshire the 28th
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
right to work state unfortunately under
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
current law in New Hampshire a union BOS
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
can choose to impose Monopoly bargaining
 
01:26:27.030 --> 01:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
on workers taking away an individual's
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
right to negotiate for themsel they then
 
01:26:31.709 --> 01:26:31.719 align:start position:0%
demand the government enforced authority
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
to extract user fees from that
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
unconsenting worker adding insult to
 
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
injury as polls show the vast majority
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
of Voters agree it's just plain wrong
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would guarantee workers the
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
right to decide for themselves whether
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
or not a labor union deserves their
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
financial support the same as any other
 
01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:50.590 align:start position:0%
financial support the same as any other
private

01:26:50.590 --> 01:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
organization once when I asked if you
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
would support a controversial resolution
 
01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
at a national Union convention former
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
iosa State Education Association
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
executive director Fred comr said hell
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
no we don't support it Iowa is a right
 
01:27:04.910 --> 01:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
to work state we have to earn our
 
01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
membership if we supported that we'd
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
lose too many members you see without
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
Right to Work protections there's little
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
incentive for Union officials to offer a
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
good service to their members they can
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
compel people to pay them either way
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
fact is good unions don't need Force
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
dues and bad unions don't deserve them
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
furthermore it's clear that right to
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%

Outlook from 2009 to 2019 the percentage
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
growth in people employed was 88.1% in
 
01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and 99.6% in all such forc
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
unionism States right to work states on
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
the other hand enjoyed employment growth
 
01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.310 align:start position:0%
the other hand enjoyed employment growth
of

01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
16.9% more than double hours it's no
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
surprise because his area development
 
01:27:51.229 --> 01:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
magazine surveys have consistently found
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 50 to 80% of Business
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
Leaders and site selection Consultants
 
01:27:57.830 --> 01:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
consider a state's rights work status
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
either important or very important to
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
their decisions furthermore residents of
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
right to work states enjoy roughly
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
$4,500 more in average cost of living
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
adjusted disposable income per year
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
clearly not only is Right to Work the
 
01:28:15.149 --> 01:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
morally right thing to do but protecting
 
01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
this Freedom will also help New
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers and the New Hampshire
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
economy therefore I urge all of you to

you thank you Mr peder are there any
 
01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenter in the
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
L seeing none uh on online um
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative Susi you recognize for
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
question than you thank Mr bet bet for
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
taking the question um my question is
 
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
this if you have an employer and an
 
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
employee or group of employees who
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
decide that um the employee they're
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
going to organize in a
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
company um you think it's worthwhile for
 
01:29:02.590 --> 01:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
that employer to have to negotiate a
 
01:29:05.790 --> 01:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
separate contract for each
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
individual or is it better that they
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
whole well the employer would have the
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
ability to negotiate contracts uniformly
 
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
on their end regardless of the Union
 
01:29:27.109 --> 01:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
status of the
 
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
employees uh in general uh varying
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
contracts uh offer a benefit because it
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
allows the incentivization of more
 
01:29:40.149 --> 01:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
productive work um which especially
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
younger workers which New Hampshire dly
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%

here honorable members of the labor
 
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Amanda Elizabeth

tol and I represent Chesire 16 which

encompasses the city of keen at large
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
workers are the backbone of the American
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
economy and organizing has bettered
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
their lives unions have brought us the
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
weekend child labor laws and sexual
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
harassment laws when union membership
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
was at its highest workers did better
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
prior to the 1980s when more workers
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
were unionized worker gains in
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
productivity were coupled with wage in
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
increases since then as union membership
 
01:31:02.189 --> 01:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
has declined these have decoupled if
 
01:31:03.990 --> 01:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
American workers had gotten wage
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
increases in line with increases in
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
their labor productivity between 1980 in
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
2008 the average wage in 2008 would have
 
01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
been 2853 an hour
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
42.7% higher than it was the evidence is
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
clear that unions benefit all workers
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
how however as someone who ran and got
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
elected on an intersectional feminist
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
platform I want to talk today
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
specifically about how unions impact
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
women Children and Families the right
 
01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
Prides itself on saying that they are
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
pro- family values the overall health of
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
a family unit is tied to the family's
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
economic well-being research has shown
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
that a decline in Union membership
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
negatively impacts all workers but it
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
even more drastically impacts women and
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
folks in marginalized communities unions
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
have helped to narrow both the gender
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
and the racial wage gaps the gender wage
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
Gap among union members is half the size
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
of the wage Gap among non-union members
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
female union members on average earn
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
over $200 a week more than non-union
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
members the racial wage Gap is also
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
smaller for union workers according to
 
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:15.080 align:start position:0%
the Center for economic and policy
 
01:32:17.709 --> 01:32:17.719 align:start position:0%
research black union workers on average
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
earn 16.4% higher wages than similar non
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
Union black workers union members also
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
have increased access to healthare which
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
is essential for all including women
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
families and marginalized communities a
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
CPR report found that in the service
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
sector for example those in unions were
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
about 19 percentage points more likely
 
01:32:41.310 --> 01:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
to have employer provided health
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
insurance further union membership
 
01:32:46.590 --> 01:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
increases access to paid time off for
 
01:32:49.709 --> 01:32:49.719 align:start position:0%
workers everyone deserves paid time off
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
but this is especially impact the
 
01:32:55.109 --> 01:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
quality of life for women we all know
 
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
that women do the majority of caretaking
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
work in our society and in their
 
01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:01.719 align:start position:0%
families they are twice as likely to be
 
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
Caregivers for an elderly parent and 10
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
times more likely to take a day off to
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
care for a sick child when women don't
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
have access to pay time off families
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
suffer this can put women in an
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
impossible position trying to balance
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
caregiving responsibilities with work or
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
making a decision to leave the workforce
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
and impact their families economically
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
when they cannot manage that balance 82%
 
01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
of unionized workers have access to
 
01:33:32.350 --> 01:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
paytime off as opposed to just 62% of
 
01:33:35.310 --> 01:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
non-unionized workers labor unions
 
01:33:38.189 --> 01:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
emphasize inclusion and elevation of all
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
workers as journalist Hannah Brooks
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
olssen has written whereas both the
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
private and public sectors have talked a
 
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
big game about closing gaps in reducing
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
unemployment levels of people of color
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
lgbtqia plus folks disabled people and
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
many other intersections of identity
 
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
organized labor has actively pursued a
 
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
more inclusive Workforce that offers
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination protections support
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
of unions in organized labor is a true
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
pro- family position for this reason and
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
to show support for all workers
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of race gender class ability
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
or sexual orientation I urge you to
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%

family leave so could you tell me a bit
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
more about how union workers have this
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
benefit and so many of the non-un

opposition to S
 
01:35:44.109 --> 01:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
sp61 now s sp61 and Right to Work bills
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
like it have made our way through our
 
01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
legislature every session for the last
 
01:35:50.109 --> 01:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
40 years and every session we have to
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
listen to the same bogus CLA claims
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
about growing our economy and protecting
 
01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
workers freedoms and these claims couldn
 
01:35:58.350 --> 01:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
not be further from the truth all that
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
right to work laws do is to suppress
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
wages lower workplace safety and reduce
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
the quality of Public Services that we
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
rely on in our communities if that
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
weren't enough these be these laws also
 
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
work to line the pockets of outstate
 
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
lobbyists and their billionaire funders
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
these bills are not about what's best
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
for workers it's about what's best for
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
exploiting them proponents of right work
 
01:36:23.189 --> 01:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
claim that it protects workers from
 
01:36:25.229 --> 01:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
being forced to join a union but as
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
everybody already knows federal law does
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
that in fact back in 2018 Governor Chris
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
anunu even acknowledged that there's
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
quote no need to pursue any additional
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
legislation unquote when it comes to
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
right to work in New Hampshire so why
 
01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
are we still pursuing this legislation
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
and I think I can tell you why this bill
 
01:36:47.790 --> 01:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
is a distinct attempt by out ofate
 
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
corporate special interest groups to
 
01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
abolish unions altogether they really
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't care less about the freedom of
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's workers real freedom is
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to stand together with your
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
co-worker and negotiate for things like
 
01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:02.679 align:start position:0%
retirement security workplace safety
 
01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
better benefits and that's precisely
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
what will go away if right to work is
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
enacted but don't take my word for it
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
let's look at some numbers on average a
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
worker in a right to work state makes
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
$8500 a year less than the average New
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire worker the poverty rate and
 
01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:24.679 align:start position:0%
right to work states is a staggering 11%
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
compared to New Hampshire's
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
3.7 and perhaps what's the scariest is
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
the risk of workplace death is
 
01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:33.350 align:start position:0%
the risk of workplace death is
unbelievably

01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
unbelievably
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
227% more likely in a right to work
 
01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
state than it is in the state of New
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it doesn't take advanced math
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
skills to know that Right to Work
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
legislation would make our state our
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
economy and our Working Families worse
 
01:37:49.629 --> 01:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
off over the past year our workers have
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
sacrificed so much and and many have
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
died to keep our economy going to the
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic the fact that this
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
bill will make workplaces even more
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
unsafe is a slap to the face of the
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
essential workers our lawmakers t as
 
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
Heroes so with this in mind I'm asking
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
you to stand with the Working Families
 
01:38:09.149 --> 01:38:09.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and vote no on Senate
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 61 thank you for your time Mr
 
01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr Brackett any
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
questions here in the L I have one for
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr bracket how would an acting right
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
make Union
 
01:38:32.669 --> 01:38:32.679 align:start position:0%
shops unsafe or less safe as you just
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
said it makes it less safe because the
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
union has the opportunity if there's an
 
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:40.360 align:start position:0%
unsafe condition on a workplace the
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
union has the right to approach
 
01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
management without fear of Retribution
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
or loss of job to say to management this
 
01:38:49.629 --> 01:38:49.639 align:start position:0%
is unsafe if you don't if you're not in
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
a union you don't have just C you don't
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
have just cause protection your employee
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
at will coming forward in a non-union
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
job with a complaint about work safely
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you any questions online
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:23.229 --> 01:39:23.239 align:start position:0%
sir get off to a good start um Mr
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
bracket um the committee received SE
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
several um uh letters via email from uh
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
contractors um in fact groups of
 
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
contractors would sign on to uh at least
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
three or four letters um in opposition
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
to right to work uh could could you
 
01:39:44.589 --> 01:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
explain or can you explain why it would
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
be that that um employers are opposing
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
Right to Work sure and and and I'm G to
 
01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go parochial just for a
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
second here I'm an electrical worker
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
I've been a union electrical worker for
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
42 years this is how it works the
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
electrical industry the union with their
 
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
own money establishes a training center
 
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
there's no taxpayer money involved
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
there's no private money involved it's
 
01:40:09.109 --> 01:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
Union money they establish a training
 
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
center we we hire we bring on people and
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
say Here's what we're going to do we're
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to bring you in free no expense to
 
01:40:19.390 --> 01:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
you we're going to train you for five
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
years on all ask ects of being an
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
electrician at the end of five years you
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
will graduate as a licensed electrician
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire you'll
 
01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
have a pension benefit and you'll have
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
health care we can place you in jobs
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
because we have agreements with
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
signatory contractors who love the fact
 
01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
that they can ask for five or six
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
licensed electricians to go to the
 
01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
shipyard on Monday and they know they're
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
going to get a qualified electrician who
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
can pass a security background who can
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
pass a drug test who's fully qualified
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
in OSHA and they don't have any worries
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
about the employee coming in but the
 
01:40:57.629 --> 01:40:57.639 align:start position:0%
deal is when somebody comes in the door
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
in The Apprentice program they
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
understand that the way that their
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
training was paid for is those that came
 
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
before them paid so they get trained
 
01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
there is no taxpayer money involved in
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
this and the agreement between two
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
private entities Union is a business we
 
01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
pay taxes just like everybody else we
 
01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:21.639 align:start position:0%
make a contract with an employer
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
that agrees with our funding mechanism
 
01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
to train our employees because it's
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
win-win for everybody it is it is the
 
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
free market working together what Right
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
to Work would do would make the
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
agreement that the unions have the
 
01:41:35.310 --> 01:41:35.320 align:start position:0%
unions that train their people and
 
01:41:37.390 --> 01:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
provide them it would make the contract
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
we have with our employers illegal we
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't have the agreement we've had
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
for 50 years that has worked for
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
everybody and I think altogether you're
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
going to see between 50 and 60
 
01:41:48.270 --> 01:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
businesses who aren't real happy with
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is still
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
messing with this um and I I got to tell
 
01:41:56.750 --> 01:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
you I don't understand why the
 
01:41:59.310 --> 01:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to get into contracts
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
between two private businesses I don't
 
01:42:03.149 --> 01:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
understand that but I'll leave that to
 
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
someone else to explain thank

talking about the funding for training
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
programs and I was wondering in in terms
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill does that funding come from
 
01:42:36.669 --> 01:42:36.679 align:start position:0%
agency fee or is that funding only from
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh union
 
01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.310 align:start position:0%

dasis of Manchester and uh on behalf of
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
Bishop Peter lashi I want to
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
respectfully register our opposition to
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
sb61 and I've also submitted written
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
testimony um back in 1981 Pope John Paul
 
01:43:42.669 --> 01:43:42.679 align:start position:0%
II issued an important letter that was
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
called on human work and he focused on
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
the Dignity of work and one of the
 
01:43:50.350 --> 01:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
central points uh that he made in the
 
01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.430 align:start position:0%
central points uh that he made in the
letter

01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
a point that I think probably we all can
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
agree on uh was to emphasize the
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
priority of people over things and that
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
the economy has to serve human beings
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
and not the other way around um and in
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
light of that uh John Paul called labor
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
unions indispensable elements of social
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
life in modern society that have the
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
role of securing the just rights of
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
workers within the framework of the
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
common good of the whole society
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
um and with that in mind there are three
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
questions that we would offer up as a
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
useful framework for deliberation on
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
61 first of all does it benefit the
 
01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:35.950 align:start position:0%
61 first of all does it benefit the
common

01:44:35.950 --> 01:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
good second does it provide a just
 
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
balance between the interests of workers
 
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.270 align:start position:0%
balance between the interests of workers
and

01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
employers and third does it protect the
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
natural right of workers to assemble and
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
form associations
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
and because we think that
 
01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
sb61 would diminish the ability of
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
unions to carry out their duties we
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
believe that these questions produce
 
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
negative answers uh and for that reason
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
we respectfully oppose the bill uh thank
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
you very much for your uh consideration
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%

representative that's correct can you
hear

01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
me than
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
much uh good morning um I am sea Marrs
 
01:45:51.310 --> 01:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
and former State Rep formerly on the
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
labor committee uh and representing
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
myself but I am from eping I I am a
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
union firefighter and a lifelong
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
Republican I'm speaking uh because I
 
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
believe that this is the most important
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
legislation facing New Hampshire and the
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
future political climate in New
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today uh what
 
01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
sb61 actually is is the good old hi I'm
 
01:46:12.669 --> 01:46:12.679 align:start position:0%
from the government and I'm here to help
 
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
um and I believe this is absolutely true
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
because in this case not one taxpayer
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
dollar will be affected by this bill uh
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
because as we all know with the Jan
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
decision teachers firefighters cops and
 
01:46:24.750 --> 01:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
every other federal state or Municipal
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
Employee already has right to work um
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
and also like to note that you didn't
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
see any mass e-lux of any union workers
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
when that did pass um just for the
 
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
record I'd like to say that uh I believe
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
the Nea is one of the worst institutions
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
in America and needs a lot of fixing but
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is not the way to fix it as a
 
01:46:48.990 --> 01:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
Republican state rep I put on three
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
trade career affirs uh involving all of
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
the trades and I'm going to put on more
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
and I would I got I would say 40 to 50
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents lifelong careers
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
for which they paid not one dime to
 
01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
obtain and uh these careers pay $100,000
 
01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
after five or six years these careers
 
01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
are also much needed as we know if
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
anybody's ever tried to get a plumber or
 
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
an electrician in in short time um more
 
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
than likely because you had uh the
 
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
school systems telling our kids that
 
01:47:18.669 --> 01:47:18.679 align:start position:0%
they need to go and get a bachelor's
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
degree even if it's in basket weaving in
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
order to be successful uh those poor
 
01:47:25.149 --> 01:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
kids are riddled with debt right now but
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
none of the 40 or 50 workers that I
 
01:47:30.910 --> 01:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
helped get lifelong careers are in any
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
debt at all uh the trades I'd like to
 
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
focus on the trades uh these you the
 
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
plumbers carpers electricians iron
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
workers Etc they offer New Hampshire
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
residents a chance to show up on day one
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
not even know what a screw driver is and
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
get paid on that day one uh and while
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
they begin their their career they're
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
while they're getting paid on day one
 
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
they're trained in these apprenticeship
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
programs and these apprenticeship
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
programs are funded by the unions not
 
01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
only do they get this free training uh
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
rather than pay for a trade school but
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
you also have a business agent for these
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
unions going out and getting the actual
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
work for these
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
workers um just wanted to point that out
 
01:48:17.229 --> 01:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
as well um a vote for this bill is a
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
vote to kill that free training in these
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
lifelong careers for all of our New
 
01:48:23.470 --> 01:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents because they're not
 
01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
going to be able to put on these
 
01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships that many people that
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
you most of them are uh many of them are
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
Associates degrees programs now and you
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
could do this or you could go and you
 
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
could pay for your own schooling uh
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's your choice there the big
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
argument is that no one should be forced
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
to junor Union but uh that statement is
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
fake news and I have laws to back that
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
up this isn't hyperbole or opinion um
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
federal law no one can be forced to join
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
Union that is communication work is vers
 
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
Beck that provides that there are agency
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
fees uh that an employee can pay in lie
 
01:48:59.310 --> 01:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
of joining a union those fees are paid
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
for representation at the negotiating
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
table because as we all know per the
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
Taft heartley act uh in 1947 all unions
 
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
must represent all employees whether
 
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
they are in the union or not and nobody
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
wants preloaders correct um federal law
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
the National Labor Relations Act if an
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
employees of any company do not wish to
 
01:49:20.910 --> 01:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
have a union representing them
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
all it takes is 30% of those workers to
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
demand a vote to abolish the union and a
 
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
simple majority to abolish that Union no
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
one is forced to stay in or to join
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
these unions um Talk politics here uh
 
01:49:37.229 --> 01:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
per federal law no union dues can be
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
used for political purposes unless the
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
employee signs a paper donating to the
 
01:49:43.629 --> 01:49:43.639 align:start position:0%
political action committee I in fact
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't donate to mind but that's a fact
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
if you think you can prove that a union
 
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
does use dues for politics illegally
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
just press charges because the law is
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
there um I'd like to speak to my fellow
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
Republicans without trying to offend
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
anybody um right now but this is about
 
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
politics uh 36% of union workers in New
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are registered Democrats the
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
rest are either Republican or
 
01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:09.390 align:start position:0%
rest are either Republican or
independent

01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
um this bill is a loser this this
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
concept is zero for
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
48 in the state of New Hampshire and I
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
just want to point out if you I don't
 
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
know if I'm on camera here can anybody
 
01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:22.870 align:start position:0%
know if I'm on camera here can anybody
see

01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
that no okay so in the last time we
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
passed this bill in the House of
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives it it got killed in the
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
Senate but Republicans lost 109 seats in
 
01:50:35.709 --> 01:50:35.719 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives that's the
 
01:50:38.189 --> 01:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
definition of trying to win a battle and
 
01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
losing the war
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
um also I have a flyer here that back in
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
1956 I guess you can't see it so it
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have its impact young
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
Republicans salute labor and it tells
 
01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
the best working conditions in history
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
please go to your union meeting and
 
01:50:57.390 --> 01:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
register to vote Republican so uh in
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
closing I just want to say to my fellow
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
Republicans I do not know one iron
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
worker plumber electrician or Carpenter
 
01:51:07.750 --> 01:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
who wants no borders uh or wants uh uh
 
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
illegal aliens frankly coming over the
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
border and working undercutting Union
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
contracts down south which it happens
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
every day um so these I I think it's
 
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
critical why I'm I'm passionate about
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
this bill at this time is uh on my side
 
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
I am a republican um I I I believe that
 
01:51:29.709 --> 01:51:29.719 align:start position:0%
now is the time uh to get these
 
01:51:31.950 --> 01:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
red-blooded bluecollar Americans back
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
into our party and to just leave them
 
01:51:36.830 --> 01:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
out of politics uh if you wish to
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
restrict what unions can do such as say
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
the Nea being able to uh sit at the
 
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
table designing curriculum well fix that
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill does not fix that um but right
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
now these red-blooded bluecollar
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
Americans are ready to back whoever
 
01:51:52.510 --> 01:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
backs them and the Republican party
 
01:51:54.510 --> 01:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
needs them in our party in order to
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
um we're at a very critical time in our
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
history here I believe we're living
 
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
under under many many socialist laws if
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
we pass this we're going to lose the
 
01:52:10.069 --> 01:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
majority and me and my kids and my
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
family are going to live under more
 
01:52:14.669 --> 01:52:14.679 align:start position:0%
socialist laws so please think about the
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
war as opposed to the battle if you
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
don't agree with any of the I said we
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
got to think tactically and with that
 
01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
I'll close thank you very much it's nice
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%

are good how are you I'm doing well Sean
 
01:52:47.669 --> 01:52:47.679 align:start position:0%
hey uh one question actually it's
 
01:52:50.589 --> 01:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
probably take a couple um
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
are you are you still active in the
 
01:52:54.430 --> 01:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters I I didn't know if you had
 
01:52:58.270 --> 01:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
retired yet no no no I'm still working
 
01:52:59.830 --> 01:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh then the question is I've been
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get this question answered now
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
for quite a while and nobody seems to
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
have a a number or idea of the effects
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
since you're still effective in your
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
firefighters Union could you tell me
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
since Janice occurred in 2018 what
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of your fellow firefighters
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
have uh elected to uh not pay uh belong
 
01:53:24.990 --> 01:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
to the union and not pay union
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
dues well as far as I know that the
 
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
answer to that is zero because we want a
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
representation at the negotiating table
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
um and I'll leave it at that I just had
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
another thought that uh left my mind I
 
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you that was perfect you

01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
Shapiro Greg Moran from Spring pel
 
01:54:11.950 --> 01:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
Virginia National Right to Work
 
01:54:14.430 --> 01:54:14.440 align:start position:0%

01:54:16.069 --> 01:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
here with you I appreciate you giving me
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
a moment to speak with you I have some
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks that I'll submit online
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
I'm instead going to use this time to
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
address a number of misconceptions that
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
I've heard over the last few minutes uh
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
the twin sources of Big labor power are
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
Monopoly bargaining and force dues and
 
01:54:32.550 --> 01:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
while you have heard from New
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Union leadership and others
 
01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:36.679 align:start position:0%
and will continue to hear it um it is a
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely misinformation to claim
 
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
that federal law does not require
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
requires them to represent all workers
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
the truth is that Union officials are
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
perfectly free under federal law to
 
01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
negotiate a contract that only sets the
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions for their own
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
voluntary members but instead of
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
exercising this perfectly legitimate
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
option today's Union officials
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
consistently take advantage of the
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
provisions of federal law that give them
 
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
the tyrannical power to force every
 
01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
worker to submit to their Monopoly
 
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
representation whether that worker likes
 
01:55:06.310 --> 01:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
that representation and thinks it's
 
01:55:09.270 --> 01:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
doing well for him or Not by exercising
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
this power they forbid individual
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
workers to represent themselves and then
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
these same Union officials turn around
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
and falsely complain that since they
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
represent non-paying workers the very
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
same workers whose right to
 
01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
self-representation the union leaders
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
have just Stripped Away they should then
 
01:55:26.310 --> 01:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
be entitled to forc dues the truth of
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
the matter is the Union contract is not
 
01:55:31.069 --> 01:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
a universal benefit to all employees a
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
contract that benefits seniority works
 
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
against employees who want to work
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
harder smarter or longer and be
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
compensated and rewarded for it a
 
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
contract with a goldplated Health Care
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
Health Benefit system works against a
 
01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
younger healthier employee who might
 
01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
prefer to uh have an extra dollar an
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
hour instead and a a a stripped down
 
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
health care benefit system I'm not
 
01:55:54.669 --> 01:55:54.679 align:start position:0%
arguing one way or the other for for or
 
01:55:56.229 --> 01:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
against those proposals I'm simply
 
01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
saying that if the employee is not happy
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
with the job the union is doing
 
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
representing him he shouldn't be forced
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
to pay for it a number of other
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
misconceptions that I have heard um
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
specifically from uh representative
 
01:56:09.790 --> 01:56:09.800 align:start position:0%
abrahamson that I wanted to uh to
 
01:56:12.430 --> 01:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
address uh the biggest one uh was also
 
01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
addressed by the gentleman from the AFL
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
CIO about union hiring halls and the
 
01:56:18.589 --> 01:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship uh training that they do
 
01:56:20.069 --> 01:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is say this right
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
to work law would not affect union
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
hiring halls in any way U csection d134
 
01:56:28.589 --> 01:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
of the bill explicitly says the bill
 
01:56:30.189 --> 01:56:30.199 align:start position:0%
does not apply where preempted by
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
federal law and of course even if that
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
section was there wasn't there it still
 
01:56:35.189 --> 01:56:35.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't apply where preempted by
 
01:56:37.709 --> 01:56:37.719 align:start position:0%
federal law and federal law has long
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
since said that state right to work laws
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
do not apply to union hiring Halls so
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
all of that concern is is does does not
 
01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
even exist anymore it's no more valid
 
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
than than the concerns of public
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
employees who are already covered by
 
01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
Janice and already have right to
 
01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:55.870 align:start position:0%
Janice and already have right to
work

01:56:55.870 --> 01:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:58.470 --> 01:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
um representative abrahamson mentioned
 
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh concerned about the section seven uh
 
01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
notice posting requirement every
 
01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
employer is already required to post a
 
01:57:05.950 --> 01:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
number of notices by the federal
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
government and probably by your state
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
government as well this where what
 
01:57:11.350 --> 01:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
whatever system they already have for
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
that this notice is simply going to have
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
to go alongside those and to say that
 
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
that you can't bring it along to a job
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
site is is really just not a valid
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
concern um section six talking about
 
01:57:25.149 --> 01:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
Union boycott uh forbidding a boycott uh
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a generic boycott it's I'll
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
read you the section any strike
 
01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
picketing boycott or other action by a
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
labor organization for the sole purpose
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
of inducing or attempting to induce an
 
01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
employer to enter into any agreement
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
prohibited under this chapter is
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
declared to be illegal in other words
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
you can't do a boycott for the purpose
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
of trying to get a forc dues Clause uh
 
01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as that uh the criminal
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
penalties are there uh as they are in
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
most other state right to work laws
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
because if you don't include a criminal
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
penalty then the union is going to push
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
for a a right to work law uh I'm sorry
 
01:58:01.069 --> 01:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
the union is going to push for a forc
 
01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
dues Clause they can pressure employers
 
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
to sign it and just pay the fine as and
 
01:58:07.229 --> 01:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
consider it cost of doing business so
 
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
without a without a criminal penalty the
 
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
right to work law really has no teeth uh
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
the Mandate on Investigation again uh is
 
01:58:16.229 --> 01:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
what puts teeth into this right to work
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
law and you can talk to the Attorneys
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
General of the right to work states have
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
statements from several of them we'll be
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
happy to send you that the extra cost
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
imposed on them is is really di Minimus
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
on this uh uh the other concern I heard
 
01:58:31.990 --> 01:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
was about a subcontractor who was uh
 
01:58:35.229 --> 01:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
joins into a grandfathered Force dues
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
Clause uh that uh supposedly would be uh
 
01:58:40.990 --> 01:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
then uh in Jeopardy of criminal
 
01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
penalties no if they're forced to work
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
under a grandfathered Force Do's Clause
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
the grandfather clause applies to them
 
01:58:48.350 --> 01:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
as well so that also is really not a
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
valid concern uh the truth of the matter
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
is that a a
 
01:58:55.470 --> 01:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
a employee unhappy with his Union
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%
representation is uh is is not looking
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
for a free ride what they really want is
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
to get out they can't get out because
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
federal law lets the unions force them
 
01:59:06.990 --> 01:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
to stay in but it's just rubbing salt in
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
the wound to to say you have to accept
 
01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
representation you don't like didn't ask
 
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
for and think you'd be better off
 
01:59:14.109 --> 01:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
without and now you have to pay for it
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
too so uh that's uh that concludes my uh
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
remarks I'd be happy to take any
 
01:59:18.560 --> 01:59:20.189 align:start position:0%
remarks I'd be happy to take any
questions

01:59:20.189 --> 01:59:20.199 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh Adent do you
 
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
have a question for the presenter I do
 
01:59:27.310 --> 01:59:27.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
you're calling us today from Virginia a
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
state that is built not New Hampshire
 
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
and is 503 miles away from New Hampshire
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
but you're 70 miles away from Charleston
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
West Virginia uh where Republican
 
01:59:43.069 --> 01:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
Governor Jim justice has gone on record
 
01:59:45.550 --> 01:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
to saying that right to work was a bad
 
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
idea for West Virginia and that the mass
 
01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
influx of jobs and opportunity that were
 
01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
promised by folks representing industry
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
never came why do you think the governor
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
of a state that has an elected a
 
02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
Democrat for president in 25 years would
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
say that he regrets a right to work
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
law uh he doesn't actually regret the
 
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
right to work law if you read that whole
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh interview that you're s pulling that
 
02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
from he actually says that he does
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
support the right to work law and he's
 
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
glad they have it uh regarding my
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
presence in Virginia I I'm representing
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%

02:00:22.430 --> 02:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
before you today representing all of our
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:28.189 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%

02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
kahill uh thank you Mr chair and thank

you Mr Morad for taking my question so
 
02:00:38.069 --> 02:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
you're as my colleague said you're
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
you're not presenting the national
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
rights of work and so you're thinking
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
that 27 states have right to work and
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire you know we we
 
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
don't have Right to Work 42 states have
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
income taxes and 45 have sales taxes
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
would you say that any of those are good
 
02:00:58.350 --> 02:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
for new hamper should we just follow the
 
02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
lead because what someone else has done
 
02:01:03.669 --> 02:01:03.679 align:start position:0%
jump off a bridge as your might have
 
02:01:03.679 --> 02:01:06.430 align:start position:0%
jump off a bridge as your might have
asked

representative uh I have no opinion on
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
sales taxes versus income taxes as a
 
02:01:11.950 --> 02:01:11.960 align:start position:0%

02:01:47.790 --> 02:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
in hooks at New Hampshire when I was

first hired I was a single single parent
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
and I wanted a job with good benefits
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
that the union had negotiated for Postal
 
02:01:58.109 --> 02:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
Service career employees with the Postal
 
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
Service it was crystal clear that the
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
union was responsible for making this
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
the job that I desired because the
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
Postal Service had another category of
 
02:02:11.229 --> 02:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
employees called casuals these were not
 
02:02:13.629 --> 02:02:13.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily short timers some had worked
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
there for over 10 years were not a part
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
of any bargaining unit and could not
 
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
belong to a union their wages were far
 
02:02:23.950 --> 02:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
less than mine although they often did
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
identical work they got no sick leave no
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
health benefits and no retirement
 
02:02:31.069 --> 02:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
benefits folks were not knocking the
 
02:02:33.069 --> 02:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
doors down to become
 
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
unrepresented casuals they wanted career
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
jobs complete with all the benefits that
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
had been negotiated by the union I don't
 
02:02:43.149 --> 02:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
believe that any worker who tells you
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
they want nothing to do with the Union
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
is telling you the whole truth they do
 
02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
want the benefits achieved by the union
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
otherwise they would probably be looking
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
for work somewhere else sadly these
 
02:02:56.430 --> 02:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
benefits don't just fall out of the sky
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
you can go ask a postal casual about
 
02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
that sadly working for the USPS is
 
02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
somewhat like being in a right to work
 
02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
state people who choose not to join a
 
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
union don't share in the cost of
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
representation most postal workers do
 
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
join but not all having some enjoy
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
contract benefits without helping to pay
 
02:03:18.069 --> 02:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
for them causes Division and resentment
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't benefit F the workers or the
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
employer and certainly does nothing for
 
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
productivity the union is obligated to
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
by law to represent these non-members
 
02:03:29.790 --> 02:03:29.800 align:start position:0%
who pay nothing not even for their own
 
02:03:32.430 --> 02:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
personal representation I remember my
 
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
local defending a non-member in
 
02:03:36.550 --> 02:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
arbitration 15 years ago and the cost
 
02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
was over
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
$1,500 back then the bigger issue is the
 
02:03:44.589 --> 02:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
considerable resources required to
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
negotiate our contract if National
 
02:03:50.629 --> 02:03:50.639 align:start position:0%
postal negotiation reach an impa the
 
02:03:53.430 --> 02:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
dispute goes to an arbitrator I once
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
testified at a national arbitration
 
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
about the duties of a male processing
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
clerk I heard testimony from The
 
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
Economist and other experts listening to
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
The Economist I wondered how many hours
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
of research and preparation went into
 
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
her testimony the union paid for that
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
work without her testimony we never
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
would have convinced the arbitrator to
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
upgrade the pay for that job the gains
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
from that arbitration benefited us all
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
all even the guy who didn't pay his fair
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
share people have a real right to work
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire we have the
 
02:04:27.069 --> 02:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
right to work in a place that has a
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
union shop or to choose a new a
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
non-union shop even in Union workplaces
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
not all work Union workplaces have a
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
fair share Clause employers have to
 
02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
agree so if an employer negotiates a
 
02:04:42.350 --> 02:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
fair share as a condition of employment
 
02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
the state has no business interfering
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
just as it has no business interfering
 
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
with a dress code policy in the work
 
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
workplace if a person doesn't like a
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
company's fair share employment policy
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
or doesn't like the dress code they have
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
a perfect right to work somewhere else
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
without such a policy my union struggles
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
to meet the financial burden caused by
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
those who refuse to pay their fair share
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
if enough people decided not to do it
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
then the union would be seriously
 
02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
weakened lessen lessening our ability to
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
negotiate decent wages and benefits this
 
02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
would have a serious negative impact on
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
our state without the benefits negotia
 
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
by my union I could not afford a house
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't afford to support local
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses the way I do
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
now s sp61 does nothing to expand
 
02:05:31.229 --> 02:05:31.239 align:start position:0%
anyone's right to work it would serve
 
02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
only to weaken unions to lower our
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
standard of living and to hurt the New
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy the state should not
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
interfere with collective bargaining and
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
the employer's decision to negotiate an
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
employment policy that requires workers
 
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
to pay their share of the cost of
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
services that they enjoy and I just want
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
to add one other quick thing and that is
 
02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
when I started my job and I'm definitely
 
02:05:58.430 --> 02:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
tell telling my age here but when I
 
02:06:03.229 --> 02:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
started my job in the mid 70s I remember
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
the death of a postal employee Michael
 
02:06:08.270 --> 02:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
mcdad I still remember his name he was a
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
young father who got sucked into a
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
conveyor belt in New York on the docks
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
of a post office and our Union mounted a
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
huge saf campaign that changed the laws
 
02:06:24.430 --> 02:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
that stop the deaths and stop people
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
from being sucked into conveyor belts
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
they made that difference and that's
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
what they do for safety so that's why
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
it's important for me to keep the
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
strength of our Union thank you so
 
02:06:40.030 --> 02:06:40.040 align:start position:0%

chairman I just want to clarify because
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
in the discussion I had with the fellow
 
02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
from National right to work there was a
 
02:07:10.030 --> 02:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
disagreement on the quote from Governor
 
02:07:12.189 --> 02:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
Justice and I got the source so I just
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to read that the record this is
 
02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
from the metro news uh the voice of West
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
Virginia uh that was the moment Justice
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
a republican told citizens that the key
 
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
policies put forth by state officials in
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
recent years haven't paid off those
 
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
included right to work in the
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
elimination of prevailing wage both top
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
priorities of the Republican wave that
 
02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
swpt into swept into the legislature
 
02:07:36.990 --> 02:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
just a few years ago quote really and
 
02:07:38.990 --> 02:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
truly let's be brutally honest the
 
02:07:41.310 --> 02:07:41.320 align:start position:0%
governor said we passed right to work a
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
lot in West Virginia we ran to the
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
windows looking to see all the people
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%

02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
we got rid of prevailing wage and we
 
02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
changed our tax structure and we've run
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%

I am here today on behalf of the AFL CIO
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
in opposition to Senate Bill
 
02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
61 Right to Work Advocates assert that
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
right to work states
 
02:09:04.510 --> 02:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
outperform non-right toor states that's
 
02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
what we've heard this morning these
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
arguments should be rejected for four
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
reasons and I'll be succinct first
 
02:09:16.030 --> 02:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
economic growth data shows that
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
economies in non-ri to work States
 
02:09:22.589 --> 02:09:22.599 align:start position:0%
outperformed right to work states by
 
02:09:25.790 --> 02:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
nearly three percentage points during
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
the most recent expansionary period
 
02:09:31.549 --> 02:09:31.559 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic furthermore
 
02:09:33.549 --> 02:09:33.559 align:start position:0%
economies in non-right to work states
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire outperform the five
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
newest comers to Right to Work by more
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
than six and a half percentage points of
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
economic growth now looking just at New
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire's wage growth
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
during this this period exceeded the
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
average for all the right to work states
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
we produced more
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
apprentices apprenticeships lower worker
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
fatality rates and on the productivity
 
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
side New Hampshire produces nearly
 
02:10:09.390 --> 02:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
$1,650 more in Gross State product per
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
worker than a right to work states
 
02:10:14.790 --> 02:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
proponents Overlook these key
 
02:10:17.790 --> 02:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
performance metrics of worker safety
 
02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:18.870 align:start position:0%
performance metrics of worker safety

02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%

wage and economic
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
growth second there are better
 
02:10:31.870 --> 02:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
explanations for why some right to work
 
02:10:35.669 --> 02:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
states are performing well for example
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
electric prices on average are 50%
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
higher in non-right to work states like
 
02:10:46.030 --> 02:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the tax climate on
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
average is more favorable to businesses
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
overall in right to work states compared
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
to non-ri to work states these are well
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
documented factors in States economic
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
performance but proponents fail to
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
control for these
 
02:11:10.149 --> 02:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
explanations third Right to Work hurts
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
workers while helping bosses and
 
02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
investors based on peer reviewed studies
 
02:11:20.390 --> 02:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
so so far we've just been talking about
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
statistics on both sides States versus
 
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
States right to work versus non-right to
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
work but now let's look at the peer
 
02:11:31.950 --> 02:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
reviewed studies and in the Journal of
 
02:11:37.069 --> 02:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
financial economics just last year um
 
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
academics uh business professors from
 
02:11:41.629 --> 02:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
Georgia Institute of Technology reviewed
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
data from over
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
18,000 collective bargaining agreements
 
02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
as well well as corporate data both
 
02:11:53.549 --> 02:11:53.559 align:start position:0%
before and after right to work was
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
adopted and across different states over
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
time the findings include the following
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
that post Right to Work wages and job
 
02:12:09.149 --> 02:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
security for unionized workers
 
02:12:12.350 --> 02:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
decreased while dividends and corporate
 
02:12:15.629 --> 02:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
executive compensation
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
increased fourth there is a strong
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
libertarian argument against Right to
 
02:12:25.629 --> 02:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
Work Milton Freedman and other prominent
 
02:12:28.229 --> 02:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
Libertarians have been consistently
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
against right to work so in conclusion
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
right to work is a new and dramatic
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
intervention into the private sector
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
contracts while the evidence suggests it
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
will have negative impacts in New
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um uh Mr chairman members of
 
02:12:48.629 --> 02:12:48.639 align:start position:0%

putting into this important issue thank
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony any questions for
 
02:12:59.549 --> 02:12:59.559 align:start position:0%
the presenter in the
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
online see see uh yes representative
 
02:13:13.750 --> 02:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
mute thank you Mr chairman um Dr Shapiro
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
um we've heard a lot of uh economic
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
statistics thrown around uh already
 
02:13:23.790 --> 02:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
today and I'm sure there there will be
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
more um but I believe you're the first
 
02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
Economist to throw around economic
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
statistics could you give us just a
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more about your background so
 
02:13:34.990 --> 02:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
we know whether uh just know more about
 
02:13:37.790 --> 02:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
your background sure uh thank you uh
 
02:13:40.589 --> 02:13:40.599 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan um in the uh
 
02:13:44.189 --> 02:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
early 1990s I completed my PhD in
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
economics from the John's Hopkins
 
02:13:48.790 --> 02:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
University and uh moved up to New
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with my husband uh who's from
 
02:13:53.950 --> 02:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the early 90s and I
 
02:13:56.990 --> 02:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
wrote my doctoral thesis on voting
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
behavior and taxes in New Hampshire in
 
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
the 1990s for the last 25 years I've
 
02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
authored numerous economic and financial
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
impact studies especially during the
 
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
first 15 years of my career up here
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
including the Statewide property tax
 
02:14:15.549 --> 02:14:15.559 align:start position:0%
study you've probably heard the word
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
donor I put that in my report donor tax
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
donor towns I've looked at the impact of
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
business and um industry and the uh
 
02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
various uh proposals over time to
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
increase taxes I've done work for
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
Community Development Finance Authority
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority a number of
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
other public policy programs on the
 
02:14:40.149 --> 02:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
economic impact I've been an expert
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
witness on local property taxes and many
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
different energy proceedings in New
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and around New England and I
 
02:14:51.589 --> 02:14:51.599 align:start position:0%
represent mostly uh business and Health
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
Care clients and I have uh represented
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
the AFL CIO a few years ago when Right
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
to Work came up last time my Approach as
 
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
an economist uh in this issue was really
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
to look at both sides and I I think
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's where kind of you see statistics
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
on both sides uh pointing to New
 
02:15:12.910 --> 02:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doing better doing worse and
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's why I really think it's important
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
to look at the academic literature where
 
02:15:20.350 --> 02:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
you have to stand up to peer review and
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
see what actually happens and here when
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
we look at the actual facts in published
 
02:15:28.510 --> 02:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
articles I was able to determine that
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
there is the consensus finding that
 
02:15:32.430 --> 02:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
there is these both negative and
 
02:15:34.669 --> 02:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
positive impacts from right to work and
 
02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm sharing with you here
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
today thank
 
02:15:42.549 --> 02:15:42.559 align:start position:0%
you any additional questions of the
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
committee members on
 
02:15:47.549 --> 02:15:47.559 align:start position:0%
Zoom see none thank you very much oh
 
02:15:48.790 --> 02:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
there is there's one here in the
 
02:15:50.709 --> 02:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
committee room uh representative H
 
02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
you're recognized thank you Mr chair um
 
02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.270 align:start position:0%
you're recognized thank you Mr chair um
Dr

02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
Dr
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
sharo you mentioned uh some of the
 
02:16:01.549 --> 02:16:01.559 align:start position:0%
successes uh that New Hampshire
 
02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
enjoys um and without going over all of
 
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
them um I'm just curious It's my
 
02:16:10.549 --> 02:16:10.559 align:start position:0%
understanding and correct me if I'm
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
wrong but in New Hampshire uh Union
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
employees are around 11% and non-union
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
employees workers are around
 
02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
89% is it your position that the success
 
02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire enjoys is brought
 
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
about because of the Union the
 
02:16:38.070 --> 02:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
11% instead of the 89% that are not
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
un I my testimony today was about the
 
02:16:44.910 --> 02:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
facts of the economy and the facts that
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
have been put forward about the
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
relationship between right to work and
 
02:16:52.349 --> 02:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
success and New Hampshire's the the data
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
is very clear that the response to right
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
to work is lower wages lower
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
benefits higher executive compensation
 
02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:03.030 align:start position:0%
benefits higher executive compensation
and

02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
dividends that's what the data shows you
 
02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
folks have the public policy choice of
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
whether you think that's going to
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
improve New Hampshire or not when the
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
findings are very significant negative
 
02:17:18.399 --> 02:17:20.270 align:start position:0%
findings are very significant negative
impacts

02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
the um 11 it's actually around 10% of
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
unions and it's actually less when
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
you're just looking at private sector
 
02:17:30.669 --> 02:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
and it varies across Industries the
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire economy reflects
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
the union representation and the union
 
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
presence in the trades and utilities and
 
02:17:41.469 --> 02:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
other industries that you've heard about
 
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
today that's part of the myu I'm not I'm
 
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on the factors and
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't perform a study on New
 
02:17:52.750 --> 02:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's uh role of the unions we can
 
02:17:54.589 --> 02:17:54.599 align:start position:0%
look at the facts of New Hampshire's
 
02:17:56.830 --> 02:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
economy and look at the facts of what
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
right to work has done in other states
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
to wages and benefits and to the uh the
 
02:18:07.709 --> 02:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
the successes of the businesses and who
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
gains from those successes and what
 
02:18:11.309 --> 02:18:11.319 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the literature is there's
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
a shift toward executive compensation
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
and dividends in when right to work is
 
02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
adopted and uh the collective bargaining
 
02:18:23.469 --> 02:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
agreements go are reduced the number are
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
wages thank you follow
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
follow thank you for your answer um the
 
02:18:35.359 --> 02:18:37.230 align:start position:0%
follow thank you for your answer um the
followup

02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
followup
 
02:18:40.030 --> 02:18:40.040 align:start position:0%
is are those benefits that you're
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
talking about you mention um are those
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
strictly for U the shops the employees
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh in those uh States or is that for the
 
02:18:56.830 --> 02:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
overall of all uh
 
02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:00.309 align:start position:0%
overall of all uh
businesses

02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:03.870 --> 02:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
States the uh the only mention I had of
 
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
benefits was in one of the statistical
 
02:19:08.910 --> 02:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
comparisons and that's not just of union
 
02:19:11.549 --> 02:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
jobs that's in terms of the penetration
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
rates for the percent of total workers
 
02:19:16.509 --> 02:19:16.519 align:start position:0%
in a state that have benefits so that
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
that was state level data not based on
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
whether it's a union job or not a union
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
job thank you a question for thank you
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you Dr sh for the
 
02:19:29.870 --> 02:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
question um you mentioned the shift
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
towards uh CEO compensation over the
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
last several decades we had a rep
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
earlier uh that testified the same thing
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
um American wages for the longest time
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
have been stagnant uh since about
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
1970 um very con very coincidentally uh
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
no state in the United States
 
02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
has more Union participation as Alabama
 
02:19:54.349 --> 02:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
did in 1946 you believe there's a
 
02:19:57.070 --> 02:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
possibility of correlation
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
there um as an economist I think it's
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
really really important and what I've
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
tried to provide for you today by the
 
02:20:08.429 --> 02:20:08.439 align:start position:0%
analysis of the statistics on both sides
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
is oneoff statistics are nice
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
observations but they're not based on a
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
model or conclusion or rigorous review
 
02:20:20.670 --> 02:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
so you know one State's success or
 
02:20:25.790 --> 02:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
failure is a uh an interesting
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
observation but I can't comment on
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
correlation or causation because that's
 
02:20:32.830 --> 02:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
not a model that that that's not
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
something that try to based on how firms
 
02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
behave how they make investments what
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
are the incentives so whether Alabama
 
02:20:45.389 --> 02:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
did this or Indiana did that um is not
 
02:20:47.510 --> 02:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
an economic model it's a comment so I
 
02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
can't tell you whether it's correlation
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
or causation I don't know what part of
 
02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
the analysis you know that that would be
 
02:20:55.469 --> 02:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't have enough background
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
to respond to that thank you
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%

02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
confused are is your testimony in
 
02:21:14.469 --> 02:21:14.479 align:start position:0%

right to work
 
02:21:20.429 --> 02:21:20.439 align:start position:0%
I'm against right to work thank you no
 
02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:24.120 align:start position:0%

by Richard Gula and Greg
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
Moore Mr
 
02:21:43.510 --> 02:21:43.520 align:start position:0%

yes thank you for the record my name is
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
Dave juv I'm a senior vice president
 
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
with the business and industry
 
02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
Association we serve as New Hampshire
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide Chamber of Commerce and we
 
02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
have 400 plus company members that are a
 
02:22:02.349 --> 02:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
part of our association I'd like to make
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
three very quick points one is um the
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
Janice decision has been raised earlier
 
02:22:11.469 --> 02:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
by earlier people testifying but there
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
hasn't been a lot of conversation about
 
02:22:15.630 --> 02:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
it and what that decision did from the
 
02:22:17.790 --> 02:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court in 2008 18 is
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
essentially create right to work for
 
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
public sector
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
employees and it hasn't proven to be an
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
Armageddon it hasn't proven to be the uh
 
02:22:31.389 --> 02:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
death of of public sector uh employee
 
02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
unions um it have we haven't seen a
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
flood of public sector employees uh
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
choosing to uh not pay union dues or not
 
02:22:45.790 --> 02:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
pay agency fees it it it just hasn't
 
02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
been the um you just haven't heard uh
 
02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
the horrible effect that it has had that
 
02:22:55.830 --> 02:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
that uh opponents are right to work are
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting what happen if you pass this
 
02:23:02.510 --> 02:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
bill um we think that uh reason is
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
because uh public sector employee unions
 
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
are having to work hard they're having
 
02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
to show their value and they are showing
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
their value and and in response union
 
02:23:16.510 --> 02:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
members are are uh supporting them by
 
02:23:19.950 --> 02:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
paying their Union does uh we think the
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
same thing could happen in New Hampshire
 
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
with private sector unions if Senate
 
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 61 uh passes and and I guess I
 
02:23:29.590 --> 02:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
should say in passing that the Bia
 
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
supports Senate Bill 61 the second uh
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
point I'd like to make is that we do
 
02:23:38.269 --> 02:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
believe there is an economic opportunity
 
02:23:42.750 --> 02:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
here New Hampshire uh would be the only
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
state in the northeastern United States
 
02:23:48.389 --> 02:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
to uh uh be right to work state if this
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
bill is passed and signed into law and
 
02:23:52.750 --> 02:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
we think that's significant because we
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
know there are New Hampshire employers
 
02:23:57.790 --> 02:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
and companies across the country that
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
will only choose to uh expand or locate
 
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
in right to work states and no it's not
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
the only factor that companies use but
 
02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
it is an important factor and and one
 
02:24:14.469 --> 02:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
that she we shouldn't dismiss so I would
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
urge uh the committee to
 
02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh recommend this bill ought to pass um
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy to address any
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr juet are there
 
02:24:32.309 --> 02:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:34.990 --> 02:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
Zoom representative Susie recognize her
 
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
Mr juv for taking my
 
02:24:42.429 --> 02:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
question real quickly uh back in
 
02:24:44.510 --> 02:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
February you tested before this
 
02:24:47.309 --> 02:24:47.319 align:start position:0%
committee on Two Bills uh one dealt with
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
sick time and the other one dealt with
 
02:24:51.870 --> 02:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
earned but unused um paid
 
02:24:56.590 --> 02:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
leave and you testified and stated that
 
02:24:59.190 --> 02:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
you don't think that government
 
02:25:01.070 --> 02:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
interference government interference
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
should take place and privately held
 
02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
businesses and you've said that on two
 
02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
occasions so my question is if that's
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
how the Bia felt then what changes the
 
02:25:17.710 --> 02:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
Bia stance on this bill why do we need
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
government intrusion on privately held
 
02:25:23.070 --> 02:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
businesses well the difference
 
02:25:25.150 --> 02:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
representative sus I do appreciate your
 
02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
question the the difference is
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
um one could uh conclude that you're
 
02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
absent uh right to work there's no
 
02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
government intrusion on uh business and
 
02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
labor relations and and you and I both
 
02:25:44.429 --> 02:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
know that's not correct uh there's been
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh federal labor regulations stretching
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
back back to the 30s and 40s uh that uh
 
02:25:55.190 --> 02:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
regulate how uh uh labor and management
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
can conduct uh their Affairs so to
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
suggest that this is some new government
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
intrusion on employers I think is is
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
incorrect secondly this isn't an issue
 
02:26:14.349 --> 02:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
of whether it's um appropriate for the
 
02:26:17.269 --> 02:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
company or appropriate for the Union to
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
have have this type of um Power to force
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
individuals to pay union dues or Force
 
02:26:29.150 --> 02:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
individuals to pay agency fees this is
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
about the individual employee and
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
allowing them to make a decision on
 
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
what's right for
 
02:26:40.190 --> 02:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
them followup follow up so I'll ask the
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
say I'll ask you the same question I
 
02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
asked someone
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
earlier if a private held
 
02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.309 align:start position:0%
earlier if a private held
business

02:26:47.309 --> 02:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
decides along with the employees that
 
02:26:53.309 --> 02:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
they are going to have this Union
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
represent them as the sole negotiating
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
agent for this
 
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
business do you really think that if a
 
02:27:03.230 --> 02:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
company has 200
 
02:27:05.790 --> 02:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
employees that the
 
02:27:08.990 --> 02:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
employer recognizing the sole bargaining
 
02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
agent really wants to represent every
 
02:27:17.790 --> 02:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
employee and negotiate every contract
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
with every single employee do you think
 
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
that's beneficial to the company well I
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
can't answer for every employer but but
 
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
I I can answer that the employer can
 
02:27:30.670 --> 02:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
still choose to collectively bargain
 
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
with with the union and that employee
 
02:27:37.469 --> 02:27:37.479 align:start position:0%
would be a part of that uh collective
 
02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
bargaining and one more followup Mr
 
02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:41.790 align:start position:0%
bargaining and one more followup Mr
chairman

02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:27:44.429 --> 02:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
followup Mr juv how many companies that
 
02:27:48.710 --> 02:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
companies well that's a a great question
 
02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
and and honestly I don't know the answer
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
to that however I know we do have a
 
02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
number of uh utilities and manufacturing
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
companies that uh do have unions and
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
there may be others I I honestly don't
 
02:28:09.269 --> 02:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
know uh what number or what percentage
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
of our membership has unions and Mr
 
02:28:14.269 --> 02:28:14.279 align:start position:0%

Utilities is part of your membership and
 
02:28:30.990 --> 02:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
that Liberty Utilities is opposed to S
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
sp61 um it is correct that they are in
 
02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
our membership and I would prefer for
 
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
Liberty Utilities to State their
 
02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
position rather rather than me stating
 
02:28:43.790 --> 02:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
it for them and Mr chairman if you don't
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%

very much and Mr juv this is going to be
 
02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you believe that
 
02:28:58.910 --> 02:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm in receipt of a letter from Sue
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
Fleck that opposes sb61 and I think we
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
all got it in the committee I I would
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
believe that and I would support uh M
 
02:29:11.630 --> 02:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
Fleck and Liberty Utilities from stating
 
02:29:13.590 --> 02:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
their position on this bill that's
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of state that we live in
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:23.230 --> 02:29:23.240 align:start position:0%
sir any other questions on Zoom seeing
 
02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
none represented I see your
 
02:29:28.349 --> 02:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
hand thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:29:32.950 --> 02:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
Mr J taking the question you testified
 
02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
that uh there wasn't this
 
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
Armageddon um post the Supreme Court
 
02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
decision and and I guess I'm I'm asking
 
02:29:43.269 --> 02:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
in Earnest
 
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
because um if a right to work work law
 
02:29:51.710 --> 02:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a discernable impact on
 
02:29:54.429 --> 02:29:54.439 align:start position:0%
Union membership Union
 
02:29:58.830 --> 02:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
participation that why would not only
 
02:30:01.910 --> 02:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
the the take position on it but why is
 
02:30:05.230 --> 02:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
it a deciding factor for businesses if
 
02:30:07.469 --> 02:30:07.479 align:start position:0%
it's G to have no impact on the unions
 
02:30:09.830 --> 02:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
that we have to do
 
02:30:12.389 --> 02:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
with um I don't know that it will have
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
no impact on private sector Union
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
organization rep representative I do
 
02:30:19.910 --> 02:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
think it will require private sector
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
unions to to demonstrate their value
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
every day the way Bia and other trade
 
02:30:28.030 --> 02:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
associations and Chambers do we can't
 
02:30:31.110 --> 02:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
force any business to to be a member of
 
02:30:33.990 --> 02:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
the Bia and charge the membership dues
 
02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
even though the work we do we think
 
02:30:38.990 --> 02:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
benefits all businesses in New Hampshire
 
02:30:42.510 --> 02:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh why companies would
 
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
consider that important I think most
 
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
companies would prefer to uh have Direct
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
Communications with their employees
 
02:30:53.910 --> 02:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
rather than through the layer of of a
 
02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:58.230 align:start position:0%
rather than through the layer of of a
union

02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
negotiation thank you um you you also
 
02:31:03.750 --> 02:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there were uh this would
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
be the only state um in New England that
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
would be a right to work state um and
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
because of that that there would be
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
businesses that would be intending to
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
come here uh do you know any of the
 
02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
specific spefic businesses that consider
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
that or any specific industries that
 
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
consider that um or what that makeup of
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
the L of water
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
like I don't have the names of
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
individual businesses but I do know that
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
site location companies these are uh
 
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
companies that work with employers on
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
business location and
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
relocation list right to work as um a a
 
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh characteristic that some not all but
 
02:31:47.600 --> 02:31:48.429 align:start position:0%
uh characteristic that some not all but
some

02:31:48.429 --> 02:31:48.439 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:31:52.230 --> 02:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
businesses uh use in terms of of uh
 
02:31:53.950 --> 02:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
making decisions about where they will
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
locate or expand and I know from uh
 
02:31:58.830 --> 02:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
companies within our membership that
 
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
they have suggested that they their
 
02:32:03.429 --> 02:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
expansion would be in in right to work
 
02:32:08.269 --> 02:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
states and and not in non-right to work
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
states one more followup thank you Mr
 
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'd like to use a metaphor
 
02:32:16.309 --> 02:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
of Mr TR so you come see where I've
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
coming from on this um it is we have a
 
02:32:21.389 --> 02:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
birthday on the committee of
 
02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
Representative K Hill and in continuity
 
02:32:29.630 --> 02:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
with that um I purchased a mystery box
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not gonna take it out because I
 
02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
don't know the rules on props committee
 
02:32:35.269 --> 02:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
but in my bag I've got a mystery box you
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what's in it would you be
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
willing to purchase that mystery box
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:45.240 --> 02:32:48.150 align:start position:0%
 
first

02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:32:51.190 --> 02:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
um this seems a little far a field from
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
the public policy discussion we're
 
02:32:55.150 --> 02:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
having I guess I will answer by first of
 
02:32:58.429 --> 02:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
all um my good friend representative
 
02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.510 --> 02:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
hold I
 
02:33:08.269 --> 02:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate the
 
02:33:11.510 --> 02:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
question I think what you you you stated
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
that it was a
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
metaphor please ask the question
 
02:33:18.030 --> 02:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
I think you're trying to ask and I want
 
02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
to be specific
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
here since you don't know what's going
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
to happen with right to work why would
 
02:33:26.670 --> 02:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
you be voting in support is that your
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you the box was just
 
02:33:33.309 --> 02:33:33.319 align:start position:0%
an extension understood Mr
 
02:33:38.269 --> 02:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
ju um I think we can look to examples of
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh how right to work is uh worked in
 
02:33:45.710 --> 02:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
many other states and is it has been uh
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there are 27 other
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
states around the country that have had
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
this many for decades um and I think if
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
you look you you will find that the
 
02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
experience has been positive um I think
 
02:34:04.349 --> 02:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences is is something
 
02:34:06.910 --> 02:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
that you as public policy makers wrestle
 
02:34:08.830 --> 02:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
with on all kinds of
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislation but you you look to uh data
 
02:34:16.429 --> 02:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
and and use that to try and make what
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
you think is the best
 
02:34:21.070 --> 02:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
decision all right thank you very much

of the state employees Association SEIU
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
Local 1984 we represent more than 10,000
 
02:35:10.269 --> 02:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
workers in the state County Municipal
 
02:35:11.790 --> 02:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
and private
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
sectors despite its misleading name
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
Right to Work legislation is nothing
 
02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
more than a union busting bill it has
 
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with increasing wages
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
benefits or safety for that matter for
 
02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
working people and everything to do with
 
02:35:28.750 --> 02:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
weakening unions and removing worker
 
02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
protections Right to Work legislation
 
02:35:33.830 --> 02:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
hurts the economy in study after study
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
the legislation has proven to be wrong
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
for workers wrong for businesses and
 
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
wrong for the economy recently the
 
02:35:43.309 --> 02:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
online political website political came
 
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
out with a ranking of all 50 states
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
using a combination of Life quality
 
02:35:49.870 --> 02:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
issues including crime rates per capita
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
income and education levels they
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
averaged the 14 scores create a single
 
02:35:57.550 --> 02:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
ranking across the Spectrum I'm sure it
 
02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
will be no surprise to anyone in this
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
room to learn that the Hampshire a
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
non-right to work state top the list is
 
02:36:05.429 --> 02:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
one of the best states to live in
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
something that we can all be proud of
 
02:36:09.269 --> 02:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but what amazed me
 
02:36:11.550 --> 02:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
was that four out of the top five were
 
02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
all non-right to work working States and
 
02:36:16.349 --> 02:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
that right to work states account for
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
eight eight out of 10 of the worst
 
02:36:22.150 --> 02:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
states to live in including the worst
 
02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
five states in which to live in fact the
 
02:36:27.309 --> 02:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
majority of right to work states are not
 
02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
only below average but in the bottom 20
 
02:36:32.070 --> 02:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
of the 50
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
states how is this possible well let's
 
02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
talk about that workers in right to work
 
02:36:41.190 --> 02:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
states make an average of $1,500 less
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
per year and produce 15% Less in gross
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
domestic product than do workers in
 
02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
states without these laws workers in
 
02:36:50.269 --> 02:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
right to work states are less likely to
 
02:36:51.269 --> 02:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
have health
 
02:36:53.950 --> 02:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
insurance more workers are likely to be
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
injured or even killed on the job in
 
02:36:58.670 --> 02:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
states with these right to work
 
02:37:01.269 --> 02:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
laws communities lose jobs and Right to
 
02:37:03.510 --> 02:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
Work legislation lower wages and
 
02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
benefits seven out of 10 states with the
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
highest unemployment rates are right to
 
02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:08.910 align:start position:0%
highest unemployment rates are right to
work

02:37:08.910 --> 02:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:37:11.469 --> 02:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
states we have a great tradition here in
 
02:37:13.309 --> 02:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire of working together to
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
make it the best place to live in this
 
02:37:17.469 --> 02:37:17.479 align:start position:0%
country let's continue that good work
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
and set aside this divisive and partisan
 
02:37:22.750 --> 02:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
legislation by voting no it's bad for
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
our citizens it's bad for our businesses
 
02:37:27.389 --> 02:37:27.399 align:start position:0%
and it's bad for our state let's keep
 
02:37:30.870 --> 02:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on top of everyone's list
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
of best places to live thank
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony are
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
there any questions for the
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative in the L there is
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth thank you Mr
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr go for your
 
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um your organization as you
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
said represents public sector workers as
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
well as private
 
02:37:55.830 --> 02:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
workers and um because of that I would
 
02:37:59.710 --> 02:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
think you might be uniquely placed to
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
talk about how the portion of those
 
02:38:05.230 --> 02:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
employees who work in the public sector
 
02:38:07.550 --> 02:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
impacted uh by the Janice
 
02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
decision in ways that you're suggesting
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
Right to Work would also
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
private sector
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
workers well I don't think the Janice
 
02:38:24.030 --> 02:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
decision necessarily is is is is
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
something of that's negatively impacted
 
02:38:28.510 --> 02:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
us but this would because this is
 
02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
effectively directing private sector
 
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
businesses which is going to affect the
 
02:38:33.950 --> 02:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
spending power of workers in the state
 
02:38:35.630 --> 02:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
which is going to affect revenues for
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire which is
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
going to impact
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
um my bargaining ability at the table
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
with the state and it's also going to
 
02:38:44.590 --> 02:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
impact what people are going to be able
 
02:38:46.349 --> 02:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
to spend in business businesses in the
 
02:38:49.150 --> 02:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
state and it's also as I've stated these
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
laws tend to also inhibit um worker
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
protections and I think it's just bad
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
overall um I don't know why government
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
wants to get metal in the business of
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
private sector um businesses um with
 
02:39:05.110 --> 02:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
their with their
 
02:39:07.630 --> 02:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
employees um that that's their business
 
02:39:09.070 --> 02:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
that's government shouldn't be messing
 
02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:10.150 align:start position:0%
that's government shouldn't be messing
with

02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
that right thank you any other questions
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
here in yellow
 
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
be see any questions for the presenter
 
02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:18.670 align:start position:0%
be see any questions for the presenter
on

02:39:18.670 --> 02:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
Zoom well representative turkot S I can
 
02:39:24.510 --> 02:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
see you thank you Mr thank you Mr Feller
 
02:39:26.349 --> 02:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
uh going back to something
 
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative C were touched on could
 
02:39:31.150 --> 02:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
you give us what is uh the ratio of
 
02:39:34.110 --> 02:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
private sector and public in the
 
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
SEIU we have uh we have one um one um
 
02:39:41.269 --> 02:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
one unit one bargaining unit that is
 
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
private sector versus how many public
 
02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
and ratio of number of employees I think
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
um I think there's about I don't know we
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
represent but I want to say roughly we
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
have 35 bargaining units so there's one
 
02:39:58.269 --> 02:39:58.279 align:start position:0%
private sector and the rest are uh the
 
02:40:00.389 --> 02:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
rest are public County
 
02:40:02.269 --> 02:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
Municipal I can tell you that that
 
02:40:06.190 --> 02:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
membership thank you followup followup
 
02:40:12.110 --> 02:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
um also touching on what representative
 
02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
Seward was uh talking about the impact
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
of Janice uh you just said you think you
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
have a 100% representation in the the
 
02:40:23.790 --> 02:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
one unit that is private sector uh what
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
was the percentage of individuals in the
 
02:40:28.750 --> 02:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
public sector uh units that you lost as
 
02:40:30.790 --> 02:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
a result of Janice in other words how
 
02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
many actually resign from the union are
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
no longer paying dues um I actually I
 
02:40:37.950 --> 02:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
think our our membership went up but
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's not the point um I think you're
 
02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
focusing in the wrong area the F the
 
02:40:43.750 --> 02:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
focus of this is it's going to drive
 
02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
down wages it's going to drive down down
 
02:40:48.910 --> 02:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
citizens ability to purchase it's going
 
02:40:51.150 --> 02:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
to drive down business's Revenue it's
 
02:40:53.710 --> 02:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
going to drive down tax revenue by
 
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
passing these laws you're focusing in
 
02:40:58.870 --> 02:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:02.590 --> 02:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
area thank you for your answer I think I
 
02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
this is representative infantine I have
 
02:41:07.389 --> 02:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
a question how does that happen how does
 
02:41:10.750 --> 02:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
it drive down wages if you have a 100
 
02:41:14.349 --> 02:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
people in a union and they're all paying
 
02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
dues now
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
and you lose one person who refuses to
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
pay dues as a result
 
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
of If This Were to pass and become law
 
02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
and one person says you know I'm just
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
you don't do it for me I'm not going to
 
02:41:30.750 --> 02:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
pay the dues how does that affect the
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
bargaining and the salaries and
 
02:41:37.750 --> 02:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
then again I think I think your focus
 
02:41:39.870 --> 02:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
you no one's forced to join a union just
 
02:41:42.830 --> 02:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
like um and no one's forced to pay dues
 
02:41:44.670 --> 02:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
um what I'm what I've cited and what
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
other experts before you have cited are
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
the statistics in right to work states
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
that wages are lower they tend to be
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
lower because the bargaining power isn't
 
02:41:56.030 --> 02:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
there for the workers and that drives
 
02:41:58.349 --> 02:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
down revenue and that drives down
 
02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
people's ability to spend which
 
02:42:03.150 --> 02:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately impacts what you folks will
 
02:42:04.950 --> 02:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
do at the legislature because you'll
 
02:42:07.389 --> 02:42:07.399 align:start position:0%
have less Revenue
 
02:42:09.630 --> 02:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
ultimately I'm just stating statistics
 
02:42:11.110 --> 02:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
and I can get you those statistics if
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see them understood I have
 
02:42:16.510 --> 02:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
a question representative h yes thank
 
02:42:19.710 --> 02:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking question it's kind
 
02:42:22.710 --> 02:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
of talk
 
02:42:25.349 --> 02:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
about on those
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
statistics um is there any way in those
 
02:42:32.269 --> 02:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
statistics that show necessarily other
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
differences or other um conditions of
 
02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
those states that are being compared and
 
02:42:42.110 --> 02:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
for example I mean folks that make money
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
say in New York at a certain
 
02:42:48.269 --> 02:42:48.279 align:start position:0%
are going to make infinitely more money
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
in New York than they are in New
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and is that part of the basis
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:57.359 --> 02:43:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
seems

02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:05.349 --> 02:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
support um I'll have to research that
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:14.070 --> 02:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
you see no other questions in the
 
02:43:16.950 --> 02:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
L no questions online we thank you very
 
02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you next
 
02:43:22.990 --> 02:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
up is Greg Moore followed by Jim jerkin
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
Viola Kimi and Joe reap Greg
 
02:43:29.429 --> 02:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
representative Moes
 
02:43:31.630 --> 02:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman members of
 
02:43:32.750 --> 02:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
the committee I appreciate the
 
02:43:35.150 --> 02:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak uh to the labor
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee today my name is Greg Moore I
 
02:43:39.309 --> 02:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
am the state director with Americans for
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
Prosperity uh New Hampshire and I have a
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
long track record with this issue uh as
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
as the chair and vice chair and some of
 
02:43:49.030 --> 02:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
the other veteran committee members know
 
02:43:50.590 --> 02:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
I served as a chief of staff of the
 
02:43:52.469 --> 02:43:52.479 align:start position:0%
house and we certainly had robust
 
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
discussions about right to work at the
 
02:43:57.469 --> 02:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
time beyond that in 2006 I was working
 
02:43:59.389 --> 02:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
as a director at the Department of
 
02:44:02.110 --> 02:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services when the sea
 
02:44:04.670 --> 02:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
implemented the agency fee uh which of
 
02:44:08.030 --> 02:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
course uh went away in 2018 but but uh I
 
02:44:09.309 --> 02:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
certainly had to go through that it
 
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
didn't impact me directly as an
 
02:44:13.590 --> 02:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
unclassified employee but certainly it
 
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
impacted a number of DHHS employees as
 
02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
well as including some of some of the
 
02:44:20.110 --> 02:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
ones who worked directly for me so
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
there's there's a long track record now
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm not going to do is go down the
 
02:44:25.710 --> 02:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
same will warn path that uh every member
 
02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
of this committee who's been on this for
 
02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
more than a term has heard a gazillion
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
times um and trust me the Freshman
 
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
members of this committee will know
 
02:44:35.790 --> 02:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
quite well by the end of today uh
 
02:44:37.349 --> 02:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
instead what I'd like to do is talk a
 
02:44:39.429 --> 02:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
little bit put this into context the
 
02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
Right to Work legislation in context
 
02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
with another public policy issue that's
 
02:44:45.309 --> 02:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's also quite familiar and that that
 
02:44:47.230 --> 02:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
issue is the issue of the individual
 
02:44:49.670 --> 02:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
mandate under the Affordable Care Act uh
 
02:44:51.230 --> 02:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
you see with the individual mandate
 
02:44:52.590 --> 02:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
under the Affordable Care Act if you
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
didn't have employer sponsored Insurance
 
02:44:58.269 --> 02:44:58.279 align:start position:0%
you had two choices you could either buy
 
02:45:00.429 --> 02:45:00.439 align:start position:0%
through the government a third party uh
 
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
an insurance policy or you could pay a
 
02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
penalty to the government for the
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
privilege of not having Insurance well a
 
02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
similar situation exists in a 23 states
 
02:45:12.269 --> 02:45:12.279 align:start position:0%
that that lack Right to Work protections
 
02:45:14.230 --> 02:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh for for those individuals who work in
 
02:45:16.870 --> 02:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
a unionized Workforce with an agency fee
 
02:45:18.550 --> 02:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
they have two choices they can either
 
02:45:20.910 --> 02:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
join a third party uh as a condition of
 
02:45:23.469 --> 02:45:23.479 align:start position:0%
their employment the their Union or they
 
02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
can pay a penalty to their Union for the
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
privilege of not joining and and
 
02:45:31.469 --> 02:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
ironically the the sort of the arguments
 
02:45:33.670 --> 02:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
made by opponents of Right to Work
 
02:45:35.550 --> 02:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
mirror the arguments made by the
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
supporters of the individual mandate
 
02:45:39.510 --> 02:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
within the Affordable Care Act they
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
frequently hear them say uh people need
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
to pay their fair share and we can't
 
02:45:46.190 --> 02:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
have quote unquote free writers in the
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
system and and uh it's no surprise that
 
02:45:52.150 --> 02:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
that the individual mandate was durably
 
02:45:53.750 --> 02:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
the most unpopular provision of the
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act just as right to
 
02:45:58.590 --> 02:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
work laws consistently perform well and
 
02:46:00.710 --> 02:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
when when asked the general public their
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
opinion on the issue so what happened
 
02:46:05.469 --> 02:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
with the individual mandate well in
 
02:46:06.910 --> 02:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
early starting in
 
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
2018 the individual mandate as a part of
 
02:46:12.389 --> 02:46:12.399 align:start position:0%
the tax cut and jobs Act was that
 
02:46:15.070 --> 02:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
penalty was dropped to zero similarly
 
02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
middle of the way through 2018 the
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
penalty for not joining a union uh for
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
government employees was dropped down to
 
02:46:25.710 --> 02:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
zero what Senate Bill 61 will do is it
 
02:46:27.630 --> 02:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
would drop for private sector and
 
02:46:29.550 --> 02:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit employees it would drop the
 
02:46:31.710 --> 02:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
penalty for not joining your union down
 
02:46:33.630 --> 02:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
to zero same with the other same with
 
02:46:36.590 --> 02:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
the other two cohorts the the public
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
sector as well as now the individual
 
02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
mandate and that's the reason why it's
 
02:46:42.349 --> 02:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
so popular because it Embraces
 
02:46:44.349 --> 02:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
everything that we support the ideas of
 
02:46:46.190 --> 02:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
free expression
 
02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
in free association and and and that is
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
why this is an important piece of
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and that's why we fully
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
support it and I'd be happy to take any
 
02:46:56.349 --> 02:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee and again
 
02:46:57.990 --> 02:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
we we we ask that you find this bill out
 
02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:01.030 align:start position:0%
we we we ask that you find this bill out
to

02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:03.190 --> 02:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
pass thank you for your testimony do we
 
02:47:06.790 --> 02:47:06.800 align:start position:0%

Zoom seeing none we have a question

02:47:20.950 --> 02:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Moore for testifying before our
 
02:47:23.309 --> 02:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
committee today uh Mr Moore we've heard
 
02:47:25.150 --> 02:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
some information maybe you can clear
 
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
some stuff up for us or maybe you can
 
02:47:30.349 --> 02:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
add to it about uh about income growth
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
in states that have or have not uh uh
 
02:47:36.030 --> 02:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
instituted right to work as policy in
 
02:47:37.830 --> 02:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
their states I know that we have about
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
23 States or 22 States something like
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
that right now that have right to work
 
02:47:43.349 --> 02:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh maybe just a little bit more than
 
02:47:45.550 --> 02:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
that uh but um
 
02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
I know in the past decade more
 
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
information has come out about income
 
02:47:51.590 --> 02:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
growth can you address income growth for
 
02:47:54.590 --> 02:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
us certainly and as we stand right now
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
um as I'm sure as other members have
 
02:47:58.429 --> 02:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
pointed out there are 27 states that
 
02:48:00.590 --> 02:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
have enacted right toot work laws 23
 
02:48:03.070 --> 02:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
States uh of course have not enacted
 
02:48:05.309 --> 02:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
right to work laws since the TA heartley
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
act in
 
02:48:08.990 --> 02:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
1947 uh I think it's instructive to look
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
at the five states that have passed
 
02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
right to work laws in the last decade I
 
02:48:15.150 --> 02:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
think that that's really where we should
 
02:48:17.710 --> 02:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
focus our energies and look uh for the
 
02:48:19.950 --> 02:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
actual results as to the basis of the
 
02:48:22.269 --> 02:48:22.279 align:start position:0%
claims either by the supporters of the
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
people in opposition to right to work um
 
02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
if you look at the data from those five
 
02:48:29.590 --> 02:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
states that's uh starting with Indiana
 
02:48:34.510 --> 02:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
in 2011 uh Michigan in 2012 Wisconsin in
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
2015 and West Virginia in 2016 and then
 
02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
and then Kentucky in 2017 if uh looking
 
02:48:42.510 --> 02:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
at looking at those States one of the
 
02:48:44.230 --> 02:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
things that that absolutely did not
 
02:48:45.230 --> 02:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
happen I think it's it's important to
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
point this out the very at the very
 
02:48:48.510 --> 02:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
first instance one thing that absolutely
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
did not happen was in none of those
 
02:48:52.990 --> 02:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
states did wages go down so so I think
 
02:48:54.309 --> 02:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
that's important to point out in none of
 
02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
the five states did the wages go down
 
02:48:58.429 --> 02:48:58.439 align:start position:0%
now it's a little bit hard to get good
 
02:49:01.590 --> 02:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
data from Kentucky and West Virginia um
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
largely because West Virginia was in
 
02:49:05.469 --> 02:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
litigation so long that it's only now
 
02:49:07.870 --> 02:49:07.880 align:start position:0%
actually being fully implemented but but
 
02:49:10.190 --> 02:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
certainly in certainly in Kentucky in
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
2017 we can go back and look at and look
 
02:49:14.269 --> 02:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
at States like Indiana and Michigan
 
02:49:15.950 --> 02:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
which have had these laws in place for a
 
02:49:18.550 --> 02:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
few years now and what what we found in
 
02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
reviewing those data is that the income
 
02:49:23.349 --> 02:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
growth in Indiana and Michigan is
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
greater than their Regional counterparts
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's important to to
 
02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
keep in mind and and to consider now
 
02:49:31.790 --> 02:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's something as we all know that
 
02:49:34.229 --> 02:49:34.239 align:start position:0%
that whole area the the the so-called
 
02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
Rust Belt where we're seeing these
 
02:49:38.510 --> 02:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
states pass these laws are are frankly
 
02:49:40.150 --> 02:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
frankly not doing as well as the rest of
 
02:49:41.389 --> 02:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
the country whether it's right to work
 
02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
laws states without right to work laws
 
02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
but if you compare them to the regional
 
02:49:48.110 --> 02:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
growth within within that same that same
 
02:49:50.030 --> 02:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
region uh the states that are performing
 
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
better are the states that have recently
 
02:49:53.590 --> 02:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
enacted right to work laws I don't I
 
02:49:54.990 --> 02:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if that answers your question
 
02:49:57.309 --> 02:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
but um is that is that what you were
 
02:49:59.710 --> 02:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
looking for representative uh yes Mr
 
02:50:01.429 --> 02:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
Moore thank you very much Mr chairman
 
02:50:05.070 --> 02:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
that I apologize I'm responding to
 
02:50:11.070 --> 02:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
another legislator followup yes just
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
looking for a followup Mr
 
02:50:17.429 --> 02:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
chairman um uh thank you um as a
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
followup on that sometimes we see when
 
02:50:22.830 --> 02:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh when income growth happens we also
 
02:50:24.750 --> 02:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
see job growth happen particularly in
 
02:50:27.070 --> 02:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
private sector are there any statistics
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
that you know of that can point towards
 
02:50:31.910 --> 02:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh we have seen job
 
02:50:34.030 --> 02:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
growth in right to work
 
02:50:37.710 --> 02:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
states uh certainly there is a a robust
 
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh bit of information in that and I
 
02:50:41.389 --> 02:50:41.399 align:start position:0%
think that the the job growth comes
 
02:50:44.070 --> 02:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
before the income growth uh just from an
 
02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
economic standpoint what drives the
 
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
income growth is a scarcity of Labor
 
02:50:50.429 --> 02:50:50.439 align:start position:0%
much like much like uh here in New
 
02:50:52.429 --> 02:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when we were seeing prior to
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic some of the lowest
 
02:50:55.389 --> 02:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates we've seen
 
02:50:57.550 --> 02:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
historically uh that has a natural
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
tendency to drive labor so finding
 
02:51:02.150 --> 02:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
policies that drive job growth is how
 
02:51:04.229 --> 02:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
you drive income growth so I I'd say
 
02:51:06.030 --> 02:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
that the income growth follows from the
 
02:51:08.309 --> 02:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
job growth not the other way around uh
 
02:51:12.229 --> 02:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
but there is a a robust bit of studies
 
02:51:13.590 --> 02:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
that have been put together through the
 
02:51:16.349 --> 02:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
years look at the specific issue of job
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
growth and comparing comparing uh right
 
02:51:20.510 --> 02:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
to work states and non-right to work
 
02:51:23.790 --> 02:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
states as as other people have mentioned
 
02:51:25.510 --> 02:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
the the real challenge is controlling
 
02:51:28.469 --> 02:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
for the right to work policy and that's
 
02:51:30.510 --> 02:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
why I think it's so important to look at
 
02:51:32.750 --> 02:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
the states that have passed these laws
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
recently uh and and and I would
 
02:51:36.550 --> 02:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
encourage folks who are who are
 
02:51:38.150 --> 02:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
particularly interested as I said the
 
02:51:40.389 --> 02:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
two best examples would be would be
 
02:51:42.910 --> 02:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
Indiana and Michigan because there's
 
02:51:45.389 --> 02:51:45.399 align:start position:0%
enough evidence enough years of evidence
 
02:51:47.750 --> 02:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh behind them invariably one of the
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
things you'll find is with the passage
 
02:51:50.830 --> 02:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
of right to work you'll you'll see that
 
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
there is a protracted litigation so even
 
02:51:56.510 --> 02:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass right to work in here
 
02:51:59.429 --> 02:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
in 2021 I would expect that that you
 
02:52:01.389 --> 02:52:01.399 align:start position:0%
might see this this bill in litigation
 
02:52:05.190 --> 02:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
for uh who knows how long uh just as a
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
result of of that's the consistent model
 
02:52:09.630 --> 02:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in other states that
 
02:52:11.429 --> 02:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
have passed these types of laws and and
 
02:52:13.150 --> 02:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
I also point out those five states
 
02:52:15.670 --> 02:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
because the last to pass right to work
 
02:52:19.790 --> 02:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
prior to Indiana in 2 2011 was was
 
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma back in 1983 so there's
 
02:52:24.910 --> 02:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
obviously a big gap and comparing a lot
 
02:52:28.269 --> 02:52:28.279 align:start position:0%
of the economies uh pre1 1983 with with
 
02:52:31.030 --> 02:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
post 2011 uh can be a little bit like
 
02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
comparing apples and
 
02:52:35.389 --> 02:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
oranges thank you Mr
 
02:52:40.150 --> 02:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
Zoom seeing none in the L represent ad
 
02:52:45.229 --> 02:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Moore
 
02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you mentioned
 
02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
the uh Affordable Care acts individual
 
02:52:58.110 --> 02:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
mandate um as a comparable metaphor to
 
02:53:01.870 --> 02:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
um have or as opposite right to work um
 
02:53:03.710 --> 02:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
is it correct that the individual
 
02:53:07.349 --> 02:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
mandate um was originally defined by the
 
02:53:09.309 --> 02:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
Heritage Foundation in an effort to
 
02:53:11.070 --> 02:53:11.080 align:start position:0%
undercut the calls for universal
 
02:53:12.750 --> 02:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare in the
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
90s not in not in the exact form that it
 
02:53:17.870 --> 02:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
appeared in the Affordable Care but
 
02:53:20.429 --> 02:53:20.439 align:start position:0%
there conceptually it has been an idea
 
02:53:23.469 --> 02:53:23.479 align:start position:0%
that was that was B bantered about um
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
for many years in healthc care circles
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
certainly when when I was working at the
 
02:53:29.510 --> 02:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
and and um when I was at DHHS
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts passed something similar
 
02:53:37.349 --> 02:53:37.359 align:start position:0%
to that during my time there and that
 
02:53:38.910 --> 02:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
sort of brought the debate here to New
 
02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the middle part of the of
 
02:53:43.950 --> 02:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
the I guess we say the 2000s now uh
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
because Massachusetts had passed a Sim
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
similar piece of legislation uh there
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
that the idea has gone has been been
 
02:53:55.229 --> 02:53:55.239 align:start position:0%
around for a while now and um and there
 
02:53:57.269 --> 02:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
there are groups on on the right and the
 
02:53:59.750 --> 02:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
left who historically have passed that
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
but uh it Still Remains durably
 
02:54:03.750 --> 02:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
unpopular although who knows we might
 
02:54:05.510 --> 02:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
see it come back again uh with the
 
02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:06.990 align:start position:0%
see it come back again uh with the
current

02:54:06.990 --> 02:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
Administration follow up thank you Mr
 
02:54:12.429 --> 02:54:12.439 align:start position:0%
chairman um I don't want to
 
02:54:15.550 --> 02:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
categorize um the economic status of
 
02:54:17.150 --> 02:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
every email that we've received on this
 
02:54:18.510 --> 02:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
committee because I don't know
 
02:54:21.030 --> 02:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's personal finances uh but one
 
02:54:22.309 --> 02:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
thing I noticed where I was going
 
02:54:25.710 --> 02:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
through my legislative email is that uh
 
02:54:28.349 --> 02:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
it appeared that the overwhelming
 
02:54:31.030 --> 02:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
majority of people who wrote us opposed
 
02:54:35.150 --> 02:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
to this bill were working class folks um
 
02:54:36.429 --> 02:54:36.439 align:start position:0%
folks that come from that kind of
 
02:54:38.389 --> 02:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
demographic maybe they worked in Union
 
02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
before maybe they haven't uh maybe they
 
02:54:42.990 --> 02:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
support unions because they believe that
 
02:54:46.750 --> 02:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
um you know I Rise High f s votes um and
 
02:54:49.630 --> 02:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
the emails that we got in favor of the
 
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
bill were from uh the Bia um some I
 
02:54:57.269 --> 02:54:57.279 align:start position:0%
believe your organization sent one out
 
02:55:00.110 --> 02:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
why why do I have that perception that
 
02:55:02.429 --> 02:55:02.439 align:start position:0%
it would appear that those working class
 
02:55:04.710 --> 02:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
folks will be opposed to this while the
 
02:55:07.030 --> 02:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
industry folks would be in
 
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
support so just to clarify we we haven't
 
02:55:13.510 --> 02:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
sent any correspondence uh out uh from
 
02:55:16.030 --> 02:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
from Americans for Prosperity um ask you
 
02:55:18.790 --> 02:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
a question representative one of the
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
things I've learned through the years is
 
02:55:22.469 --> 02:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
is speculating on on people's thoughts
 
02:55:24.830 --> 02:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
and motives is a bad bad bad decision
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
when testifying before the state
 
02:55:28.990 --> 02:55:29.000 align:start position:0%

02:55:30.910 --> 02:55:30.920 align:start position:0%

legislative director for ASM Council 93
 
03:03:44.590 --> 03:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh proudly representing more than 4,000
 
03:03:46.429 --> 03:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
hardworking public sector workers here
 
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I'm here today on
 
03:03:50.590 --> 03:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
their behalf to testify in strong
 
03:03:52.190 --> 03:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
opposition to
 
03:03:54.510 --> 03:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
sb61 as you know a little over two and a
 
03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
half years ago the Supreme Court
 
03:03:58.550 --> 03:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
expressly prohibited agency fee in the
 
03:04:00.790 --> 03:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
public sector thereby instantaneously
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
making us a right to work country for
 
03:04:05.790 --> 03:04:05.800 align:start position:0%
the public sector labor movement get uh
 
03:04:07.469 --> 03:04:07.479 align:start position:0%
here we are once again opposing this
 
03:04:09.070 --> 03:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
latest effort to make New Hampshire the
 
03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
first right to work state in our region
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the country an effort that didn't TR
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
originate here in this state but rather
 
03:04:17.550 --> 03:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
within the offices of the national Right
 
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
to Work Foundation a group well funded
 
03:04:21.750 --> 03:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
by corporations and right-wing
 
03:04:23.429 --> 03:04:23.439 align:start position:0%
organizations and headquartered more
 
03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
than 500 miles away in Virginia where
 
03:04:27.830 --> 03:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation was drafted and
 
03:04:30.030 --> 03:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately cut and pasted almost Reba
 
03:04:32.429 --> 03:04:32.439 align:start position:0%
him into the bill before you today but
 
03:04:34.269 --> 03:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
given right to work's been a reality for
 
03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
us for some time now one may wonder why
 
03:04:39.030 --> 03:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
we're here today to oppose the bill well
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
in addition to standing in solidarity
 
03:04:42.990 --> 03:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
with our private sector Union brothers
 
03:04:44.750 --> 03:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
and sisters is we know the diet
 
03:04:46.269 --> 03:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
consequences that have followed when
 
03:04:49.070 --> 03:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
States pass right to work laws it's our
 
03:04:50.830 --> 03:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
belief the primary goal of this
 
03:04:52.830 --> 03:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and its deep pocketed
 
03:04:55.630 --> 03:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
corporate back is is and always has been
 
03:04:57.990 --> 03:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
simply to drain Union resources and
 
03:04:59.830 --> 03:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
weaken our ability to fight for decent
 
03:05:02.349 --> 03:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
wages benefits and safer working
 
03:05:03.910 --> 03:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
conditions when there isn't a strong
 
03:05:05.590 --> 03:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
union president to fight for workplace
 
03:05:07.710 --> 03:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
safety more workers are likely to get
 
03:05:09.710 --> 03:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
hurt or even killed on the job and when
 
03:05:10.950 --> 03:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
workers have less money in their
 
03:05:13.349 --> 03:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
paychecks they're forced to increasingly
 
03:05:15.150 --> 03:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
rely on taxpayer funded Public
 
03:05:17.229 --> 03:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
Assistance programs like food stamps and
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
subsidized Healthcare and child care and
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
they also of course have less money to
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
spend in their local and Statewide
 
03:05:25.030 --> 03:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
economies so while some businesses
 
03:05:27.150 --> 03:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
prosper from cutting wages and benefits
 
03:05:28.950 --> 03:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
more suffer especially smaller
 
03:05:30.910 --> 03:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
businesses from the reduced buying power
 
03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
of workers look I'm not going to repeat
 
03:05:35.070 --> 03:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
all the statistics suffice to say it's
 
03:05:36.870 --> 03:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
clear that these laws lead to lower
 
03:05:38.670 --> 03:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
wages and benefits for Union and
 
03:05:40.790 --> 03:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
non-union workers and have no
 
03:05:43.349 --> 03:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
discernable impact on job growth but I
 
03:05:44.670 --> 03:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
would like to talk a bit about the
 
03:05:46.469 --> 03:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
question of fundamental fairness one
 
03:05:48.510 --> 03:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
that's always been part of this debate
 
03:05:51.229 --> 03:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
in my 18 years of doing this work for
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
ask me I found that many legislators
 
03:05:55.510 --> 03:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
know that workers who choose for
 
03:05:58.070 --> 03:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
whatever reason not to support the Union
 
03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
by paying dues receive the same economic
 
03:06:03.469 --> 03:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
Ben uh benefits included in the contract
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
but I've also found that very few are
 
03:06:08.510 --> 03:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
aware that these laws also require the
 
03:06:10.229 --> 03:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
union to provide free legal
 
03:06:13.269 --> 03:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
representation to non-u paying workers
 
03:06:14.830 --> 03:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
workers who may have been suspended or
 
03:06:17.150 --> 03:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
fired or simply been denied a benefit or
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
protection included in the contract
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
unions are legally bound to provide a
 
03:06:23.429 --> 03:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
vigorous defense of these workers which
 
03:06:25.510 --> 03:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
can amount to thousands of dollars
 
03:06:27.229 --> 03:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
especially if the case ends up in
 
03:06:29.550 --> 03:06:29.560 align:start position:0%
arbitration so I can't help but wonder
 
03:06:31.469 --> 03:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
how many current New Hampshire uh New
 
03:06:34.349 --> 03:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lawmakers uh particularly the
 
03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
the new uh members are unaware of this
 
03:06:39.550 --> 03:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
fact and if so how many have chosen to
 
03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
accept as Undisputed Truth all of the
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
arguments put forward by the individuals
 
03:06:45.910 --> 03:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
who drafted this legislation and
 
03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
accounting on you men and women
 
03:06:50.590 --> 03:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
essentially serving as volunteers true
 
03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
citizen legislators to hurriedly pass
 
03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation and watch as it's
 
03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
signed into law if this bill does become
 
03:07:00.190 --> 03:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
law I'm sure you won't hear again from
 
03:07:01.750 --> 03:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
the people over V in Virginia who
 
03:07:04.030 --> 03:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
drafted the bill but you will see the
 
03:07:05.630 --> 03:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
many faces of the New Hampshire
 
03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
residents your neighbors your friends
 
03:07:08.910 --> 03:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
and even your family members who are
 
03:07:11.070 --> 03:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
hurt by it and you'll see its negative
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
impact in the communities and your
 
03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
districts many years to come I know it's
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
a busy day I'm going to close there I
 
03:07:18.870 --> 03:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
just want to say on behalf of all asme
 
03:07:21.150 --> 03:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
members and their families I thank you
 
03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
for your time and consideration today
 
03:07:25.830 --> 03:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
and for your continued dedication to
 
03:07:27.710 --> 03:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
Public Service during these
 
03:07:30.510 --> 03:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily challenging
 
03:07:32.870 --> 03:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
times thank you for your testimony any
 
03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:41.229 --> 03:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:43.469 --> 03:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
online this is representative infantine
 
03:07:45.630 --> 03:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you is it your
 
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
opinion that is it your opinion that uh
 
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
states that have Right to Work have less
 
03:07:53.389 --> 03:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
safe working
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
environments uh look when you unions are
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
always at the Forefront Mr chairman of
 
03:08:01.309 --> 03:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
fighting for these types of of issues uh
 
03:08:05.469 --> 03:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
and I believe uh uh Mr bracket in early
 
03:08:08.110 --> 03:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
testimony talked about when you're not
 
03:08:10.710 --> 03:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
protected by a union if you bring some
 
03:08:13.389 --> 03:08:13.399 align:start position:0%
type of a safety concern uh forward and
 
03:08:16.110 --> 03:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
you and you push that it's more than
 
03:08:17.790 --> 03:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
likely not going to turn out well for
 
03:08:21.670 --> 03:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
you as a worker um so yes we we do
 
03:08:24.510 --> 03:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
believe that we it's it it it's all kind
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
of uh flows together when you weaken
 
03:08:30.990 --> 03:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
unions you weaken the ability of
 
03:08:33.070 --> 03:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
individual workers and the Union as a
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
whole to fight for uh good safety
 
03:08:39.429 --> 03:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
practices and to and to bring to the
 
03:08:43.990 --> 03:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
attention of management safety issues
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
I want to I have my own fall I don't get
 
03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
it I didn't get it when Mr bracket said
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
it and I don't get it when you said it
 
03:08:53.110 --> 03:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
if you have a right to work law that
 
03:08:55.030 --> 03:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
passes and you have a small percentage
 
03:08:58.710 --> 03:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the IND individuals refusing to pay
 
03:09:01.229 --> 03:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
the the dues or the
 
03:09:05.150 --> 03:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
fees the union is still a union the
 
03:09:08.030 --> 03:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
union still takes their
 
03:09:11.389 --> 03:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
concerns to management that doesn't
 
03:09:14.510 --> 03:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
change correct
 
03:09:17.389 --> 03:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
but Mr chairman if the as I said earlier
 
03:09:19.269 --> 03:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
we believe the ultimate goal of this
 
03:09:22.429 --> 03:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
legislation is to weaken labor unions
 
03:09:25.150 --> 03:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
and as you you may not see an immediate
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
impact but over time as unions are
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
weakened these are the type of problems
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
that you
 
03:09:35.870 --> 03:09:35.880 align:start position:0%

committee uh for the record my name is

Viola ksim I want to thank you for the
 
03:11:14.110 --> 03:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I'm here on behalf
 
03:11:16.830 --> 03:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the Granite State organizing project
 
03:11:19.030 --> 03:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
we are a grass rate organization that
 
03:11:22.110 --> 03:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
unit States labor Community groups to
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
work towards a more just world I'm here
 
03:11:28.349 --> 03:11:28.359 align:start position:0%
today to express our opposition to
 
03:11:31.870 --> 03:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
sb61 uh over the decades we have seen an
 
03:11:34.110 --> 03:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
attack on organized labor by corporate
 
03:11:36.790 --> 03:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
interest and we've seen that as unions
 
03:11:39.469 --> 03:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
have declined income inequality has also
 
03:11:42.750 --> 03:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
increased so curtailing bargaining power
 
03:11:45.030 --> 03:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
for working people has contributed to A
 
03:11:48.110 --> 03:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
reduced middle class um and that and
 
03:11:49.790 --> 03:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
while incomes of those at the top
 
03:11:53.790 --> 03:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
continues to Rise um a 2016 report by
 
03:11:56.550 --> 03:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
the Center for Public Policy research
 
03:11:58.830 --> 03:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
shows that unions help to breach the
 
03:12:01.630 --> 03:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
racial inequality Gap particularly for
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
black workers in the union they receive
 
03:12:08.070 --> 03:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
16% higher wages than their nonunited
 
03:12:11.229 --> 03:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
counterparts similarly they are 177%
 
03:12:13.550 --> 03:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
more likely to have employee health
 
03:12:15.389 --> 03:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
insurance and
 
03:12:17.950 --> 03:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
18% more likely to have an employer
 
03:12:21.229 --> 03:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
retirement plan and additionally Union
 
03:12:23.349 --> 03:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
standardized wages for workers who are
 
03:12:26.190 --> 03:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
in the same position bring the racial
 
03:12:29.830 --> 03:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
and racial wage Gap the middle class is
 
03:12:32.229 --> 03:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
the backbone of our economy and without
 
03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
the voices of workers and unions racio
 
03:12:37.950 --> 03:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
and income inequality will exagerate I
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
want to call on our elected officials
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
today you all who are listening to focus
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
on policies that create good paying jobs
 
03:12:48.750 --> 03:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
policies that boost the local economy
 
03:12:50.910 --> 03:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
policies that increase consumer spending
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
and strengthen the middle class rather
 
03:12:55.950 --> 03:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
than considering Right to Work flows
 
03:12:58.110 --> 03:12:58.120 align:start position:0%

here in opposition to

this as a carpenter with over 10 years
 
03:14:07.030 --> 03:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
of experience I had grown accustomed to
 
03:14:08.750 --> 03:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
looking for side work in order to make
 
03:14:11.229 --> 03:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
ends meet as there never was enough
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
money to take care of all our needs such
 
03:14:15.910 --> 03:14:15.920 align:start position:0%

food Medical Care you get the picture
 
03:14:21.710 --> 03:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
years later I joined the carpenters
 
03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
union and found myself being a full-time
 
03:14:28.710 --> 03:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
single parent to two young boys it was a
 
03:14:30.389 --> 03:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
very difficult thing to do as it meant
 
03:14:32.469 --> 03:14:32.479 align:start position:0%
having to get my sons up around 5: in
 
03:14:34.750 --> 03:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
the morning and dropping them off at a
 
03:14:36.070 --> 03:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
friend's home by
 
03:14:39.229 --> 03:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
5:45 so that I could start my commute to
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
work being in the construction industry
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
often means traveling an hour or more to
 
03:14:46.670 --> 03:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
get to the job site and results in very
 
03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:47.870 align:start position:0%
get to the job site and results in very
long

03:14:47.870 --> 03:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
long
 
03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
days while those eight years as a single
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
dad were tough they would have been much
 
03:14:56.030 --> 03:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
much harder had it not been for my union
 
03:14:58.269 --> 03:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
membership I was able to support my
 
03:15:01.349 --> 03:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
family without any public
 
03:15:03.910 --> 03:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
assistance at one point one of my sons
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
required a lengthy brain surgery that
 
03:15:08.389 --> 03:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
resulted in nearly
 
03:15:10.630 --> 03:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
$250,000 in medical
 
03:15:15.229 --> 03:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
costs I did not have to stress and loose
 
03:15:18.269 --> 03:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
sleep over this as my family enjoyed
 
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
good medical coverage provided by my
 
03:15:22.670 --> 03:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
union and my
 
03:15:25.229 --> 03:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
employers I was able to pay off my
 
03:15:27.990 --> 03:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
portion of the costs within a
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%

03:15:32.429 --> 03:15:32.439 align:start position:0%
a challenging time in my life and it
 
03:15:35.469 --> 03:15:35.479 align:start position:0%
continues to pay off to this day my

03:15:40.830 --> 03:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
ex extensive training to succeed in my
 
03:15:42.990 --> 03:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
industry the employe ERS that I have
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
worked for strictly follow and adhere to
 
03:15:48.750 --> 03:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
all the federal guidelines regarding
 
03:15:51.910 --> 03:15:51.920 align:start position:0%

family and myself as construction is a
 
03:15:57.030 --> 03:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
very dangerous
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%

worked
 
03:16:04.750 --> 03:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
for really believe in in that safety
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
because they treat
 
03:16:10.269 --> 03:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
us as the most valuable asset that they
 
03:16:12.990 --> 03:16:13.000 align:start position:0%

forced to seek a second source of income
 
03:16:22.269 --> 03:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
and can now devote that time to being a
 
03:16:24.910 --> 03:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
better father husband and friend to

big distinction there and I want you to

corporate interest may tell you this
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
isn't a freedom issue it has always
 
03:20:18.510 --> 03:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
always been fly illegal to force anyone
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
to join a union in fact Right to Work
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
does not increase worker freedoms or job
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
creation it does the exact opposite if
 
03:20:29.429 --> 03:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
this bill passes New Hampshire will be
 
03:20:31.870 --> 03:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
the only state in Northeast to pass this
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
anti-worker legislation it has been
 
03:20:36.030 --> 03:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
proven that the states that have already
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
pass rate to work laws have low wages
 
03:20:40.469 --> 03:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
and incomes have higher poverty and
 
03:20:42.670 --> 03:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
infant mortality rates invest Less in
 
03:20:44.710 --> 03:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
public education and have increased
 
03:20:46.910 --> 03:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
workplace injury and fatality
 
03:20:50.150 --> 03:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
rates our members work hard highly
 
03:20:52.429 --> 03:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
skilled in a highly skilled industry one
 
03:20:53.910 --> 03:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
that depends on safety protocols and
 
03:20:57.309 --> 03:20:57.319 align:start position:0%
regulations to keep them safe this bill
 
03:20:59.309 --> 03:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
would DET be detrimental to their safety
 
03:21:02.070 --> 03:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
and yes it would put their lives at risk
 
03:21:03.309 --> 03:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
according to the Bureau of Labor
 
03:21:04.950 --> 03:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
Statistics workers in right to work
 
03:21:08.630 --> 03:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
states are 227% more likely to die on
 
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
the job than workers in New
 
03:21:13.269 --> 03:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I couldn't believe it when I
 
03:21:15.309 --> 03:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
first heard this statistic but when I
 
03:21:17.229 --> 03:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
thought about it there's a reason our
 
03:21:19.990 --> 03:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
state's workers are so safe and it's
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
because union members spend millions of
 
03:21:23.550 --> 03:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
dollars on a year to train and ensure
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
our members are skilled and safe on the
 
03:21:30.189 --> 03:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
job sites y local Force strongly opposes
 
03:21:31.550 --> 03:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation and we hope that you
 
03:21:33.110 --> 03:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
will help keep New Hampshire safe and
 
03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:36.000 align:start position:0%

03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
likely to die I I I didn't quite catch
 
03:21:53.870 --> 03:21:53.880 align:start position:0%

states are
 
03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
227% more likely to die on the job than
 
03:22:21.070 --> 03:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%

03:22:34.110 --> 03:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
presenter yeah on yellow be
 
03:22:36.030 --> 03:22:36.040 align:start position:0%

following up on uh chairman infantine
 
03:22:46.950 --> 03:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
question um I realized 200% sounds like
 
03:22:49.550 --> 03:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
a large number that's roughly twice the
 
03:22:52.750 --> 03:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
number um do you have the actual numbers
 
03:22:54.550 --> 03:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
actual numbers of workers who have been
 
03:22:56.469 --> 03:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
killed I mean are we talking two or
 
03:23:00.070 --> 03:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
three or are we talking hundreds or just
 
03:23:02.870 --> 03:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
just so I can get a uh more accurate
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
assessment of what that 200%
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
means so uh thank for your question one
 
03:23:11.469 --> 03:23:11.479 align:start position:0%
is actually too many I'd be happy to get

03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%

committee thank you for giving me the
 
03:23:50.469 --> 03:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify here today my
 
03:23:52.910 --> 03:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
name is Vincent vuco and I'm a senior
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
fellow with the MAA centers workers for
 
03:23:59.389 --> 03:23:59.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity project I'm here to testify
 
03:24:01.750 --> 03:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
in support of
 
03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
sb51 uh right to work so before I get
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
started you know there's been a lot of
 
03:24:07.950 --> 03:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
talk about statistics a lot of back and
 
03:24:10.590 --> 03:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
forth but you know really just want to
 
03:24:13.309 --> 03:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
get down to right to work is so before
 
03:24:15.630 --> 03:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
we get started I just want to Define
 
03:24:19.150 --> 03:24:19.160 align:start position:0%
right to work right to work simply means
 
03:24:22.030 --> 03:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
that a union can't get a worker fired
 
03:24:24.910 --> 03:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
for not paying them and now as you've
 
03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
heard with the Janice versus asby
 
03:24:29.030 --> 03:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
decision all public employees across the
 
03:24:31.229 --> 03:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
country have right to work what we're
 
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
talking about today is simply right to
 
03:24:35.510 --> 03:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
work for private sector
 
03:24:38.349 --> 03:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
employees meaning that private sector
 
03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
unions can't get Workers fired for not
 
03:24:43.269 --> 03:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
paying them it has nothing to do with
 
03:24:46.710 --> 03:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining workers unions
 
03:24:48.910 --> 03:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
they can still negotiate with employers
 
03:24:52.189 --> 03:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
over wages hours benefits anything they
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
could before a right to work law they
 
03:24:57.189 --> 03:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
can negotiate for after a right to work
 
03:24:59.110 --> 03:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
law except for the ability for the union
 
03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
to say pay us or you have to lose your
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
job now you heard uh one of the previous
 
03:25:09.309 --> 03:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
uh people testify saying that no one has
 
03:25:11.070 --> 03:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
to join the union they're absolutely
 
03:25:13.670 --> 03:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
right no one right to work state or not
 
03:25:15.630 --> 03:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
has to be forced to join a union they
 
03:25:17.110 --> 03:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
have a First Amendment right to choose
 
03:25:19.990 --> 03:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
to join or not the difference is that
 
03:25:22.590 --> 03:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
non-right to work states those workers
 
03:25:25.710 --> 03:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
have to pay the vast majority of their
 
03:25:28.790 --> 03:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
dues in what are known as agency fees to
 
03:25:31.469 --> 03:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
the union so we're not talking about
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
joining we're talking about being forced
 
03:25:35.229 --> 03:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
to pay and pretty much being forced to
 
03:25:38.670 --> 03:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
pay almost the full amount of dues to
 
03:25:41.550 --> 03:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
the union not having that option not
 
03:25:44.349 --> 03:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
having that choice so now we've heard a
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
lot about income and you know I don't
 
03:25:47.469 --> 03:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
want to bore everybody with Statistics
 
03:25:49.150 --> 03:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
if we want happy to get into that in
 
03:25:52.590 --> 03:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
question and answer um but in all of the
 
03:25:54.550 --> 03:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
most recent right to work states that
 
03:25:58.630 --> 03:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
have passed the law incomes have gone up
 
03:26:00.309 --> 03:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about right to work
 
03:26:00.319 --> 03:26:01.269 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about right to work
in

03:26:01.269 --> 03:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:26:05.070 --> 03:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
safety safety has increased in all the
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
states that have just passed right to
 
03:26:12.030 --> 03:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
work um we've heard a lot about private
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
contracts now let's step back we're not
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
talking about coming in and getting
 
03:26:19.110 --> 03:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
between an employer to employee to a
 
03:26:21.670 --> 03:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
completely neutral
 
03:26:24.750 --> 03:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
environment labor law is complex and
 
03:26:27.710 --> 03:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
there is a myriad of
 
03:26:31.030 --> 03:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
statutes on the books federally that
 
03:26:34.429 --> 03:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
give unions privileges unlike almost any
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
other institution in America unions can
 
03:26:39.070 --> 03:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
force employers to bargain with them
 
03:26:41.710 --> 03:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
they can force workers to accept the
 
03:26:43.710 --> 03:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
representation and they're even exempt
 
03:26:45.150 --> 03:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
from some
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
laws what right to work is doing is it's
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
leveling the playing field a little it's
 
03:26:52.349 --> 03:26:52.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it completely level and if
 
03:26:54.510 --> 03:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
we want to talk about eliminating Force
 
03:26:56.349 --> 03:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
riders or Free Riders that's a great
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
conversation we should do that but right
 
03:27:02.429 --> 03:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
now we're simply saying that a worker is
 
03:27:04.469 --> 03:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
forced to accept this representation
 
03:27:07.229 --> 03:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be forced to pay for it
 
03:27:10.710 --> 03:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
in addition especially if they do not
 
03:27:14.550 --> 03:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
want it one of the other um presenters
 
03:27:16.429 --> 03:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
talked about political money I think it
 
03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
was uh the representative well he's
 
03:27:22.830 --> 03:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
right 40% a third to 40% of union
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
members typically vote Republican the
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
problem is that almost all Union money
 
03:27:31.510 --> 03:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
and almost all Union support usually
 
03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
goes to Democrats now I'm not saying
 
03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:36.439 align:start position:0%
that's right or wrong and I'm not saying
 
03:27:38.590 --> 03:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
Union support is right or wrong but what
 
03:27:40.510 --> 03:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
I am saying is that there is a
 
03:27:44.030 --> 03:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
disconnect between the union membership
 
03:27:46.189 --> 03:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
and the union leadership that's why we
 
03:27:48.590 --> 03:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
need right to work that is why it's so
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
important because if workers do not feel
 
03:27:53.150 --> 03:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
like they're getting value for their
 
03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
money with right to work they can hold
 
03:27:57.550 --> 03:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
their leadership accountable they can
 
03:28:00.030 --> 03:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
say you're not doing a good job we don't
 
03:28:01.830 --> 03:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
want to pay you or you know what you are
 
03:28:04.150 --> 03:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
doing a good job you deserve our dues
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
and you've heard other people testify
 
03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
union leaders testify saying that even
 
03:28:11.389 --> 03:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
with the Janice versus abme decision
 
03:28:14.229 --> 03:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
that when workers had the choice they
 
03:28:17.189 --> 03:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
saw the value and they stayed in right
 
03:28:19.389 --> 03:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
to work is simply about Freedom we're
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to hear a lot about statistics and
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
in right to work states there is lower
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
unemploy there's lower unemployment
 
03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's higher job growth there's higher
 
03:28:30.030 --> 03:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
income growth and the benefits go on but
 
03:28:32.349 --> 03:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
at the heart of it it's simply saying
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
that a union can't force a worker to pay
 
03:28:37.469 --> 03:28:37.479 align:start position:0%
them simply to keep their job it gives
 
03:28:39.550 --> 03:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
the worker the choice so with that thank
 
03:28:42.790 --> 03:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
you for your time and happy to take any
 
03:28:45.110 --> 03:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:28:49.030 --> 03:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.389 --> 03:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
L seeing none do we have any questions
 
03:28:56.189 --> 03:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
Zoom seeing No Hands thank you very much

made a mistake uh did I I believe I
 
03:29:06.030 --> 03:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
skipped over someone unless I'm totally
 
03:29:07.870 --> 03:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
losing it Joe reap from associate
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%

03:29:28.510 --> 03:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
the worst we got to deal with today but
 
03:29:30.870 --> 03:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
um well anyway uh Ed thank you very much

background I the president and CEO of

in the conquered area I'm here to
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
express our support for
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
sb61 um but first I want to set the
 
03:29:49.030 --> 03:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
record straight about safety in training
 
03:29:51.790 --> 03:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
commitment um safety is not exclusive to
 
03:29:54.910 --> 03:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
Union or non-un um in fact uh our
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
contractors here which are predominately
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
non-union in New in New Hampshire uh
 
03:30:00.189 --> 03:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
spend millions of dollars a year on
 
03:30:01.870 --> 03:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
training and investing in their talent
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
and keeping people safe and uh the em
 
03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
and if you want to look talk about
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
safety safety uh is one of those things
 
03:30:13.189 --> 03:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
that uh we track and one of the there
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
are many indicators you could do to look
 
03:30:17.229 --> 03:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
at safety of a company of of employees
 
03:30:18.070 --> 03:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
and one of those is called The
 
03:30:20.750 --> 03:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
Experience modification or EMR and among
 
03:30:22.670 --> 03:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
our high performing members in the state
 
03:30:24.550 --> 03:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
um you'll find one is the industry
 
03:30:26.710 --> 03:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
average well in our in our state um on
 
03:30:30.070 --> 03:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
average we average below 1% around 7%
 
03:30:32.309 --> 03:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
for a safety standard and that is in
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
part because of our commitment to safety
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
and training um our association
 
03:30:38.790 --> 03:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
represents over 250 companies uh here in
 
03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
the granite state our employers
 
03:30:42.070 --> 03:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
employees are committed to that safety
 
03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
culture training and provide high
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
quality of life for their employees and
 
03:30:47.670 --> 03:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
what we want to share with is that right
 
03:30:49.990 --> 03:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
to work uh the the right of a worker to
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
join participate in or financially
 
03:30:53.550 --> 03:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
support a union is certainly a
 
03:30:54.870 --> 03:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental right that should never be
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
infringed upon the same goes of course
 
03:30:58.510 --> 03:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
for the worker who decides to make a
 
03:31:00.830 --> 03:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
different Choice the right to exercise
 
03:31:02.830 --> 03:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
such a choice is the essence of economic
 
03:31:05.229 --> 03:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
freedom the right to work protects both
 
03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
of those rights no American should be
 
03:31:09.469 --> 03:31:09.479 align:start position:0%
forced to join a union just to keep a
 
03:31:11.309 --> 03:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
job no required to pay dues to an
 
03:31:14.030 --> 03:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
organization they don't believe in Right
 
03:31:15.870 --> 03:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
to Work allows workers to freely decide
 
03:31:18.309 --> 03:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not to join a union now more
 
03:31:19.950 --> 03:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
than ever individuals are better
 
03:31:22.110 --> 03:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
informed highly educated and able to
 
03:31:23.550 --> 03:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
make decisions about what is right for
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
their economic future at the same time
 
03:31:27.710 --> 03:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
unions are more active than ever
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
communicating their value to the
 
03:31:30.990 --> 03:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
membership such laws are not about
 
03:31:33.150 --> 03:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
eliminating unions nor Outlaw their
 
03:31:35.510 --> 03:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
right to organize rather than looking at
 
03:31:37.429 --> 03:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
the sky's falling situation I'd
 
03:31:39.150 --> 03:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
encourage union leaders to instead look
 
03:31:41.030 --> 03:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
at the work they're doing to try to
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
better communicate the value they
 
03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
believe they're providing to their
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
members every day uh and also uh
 
03:31:47.630 --> 03:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
something that I would like to also make
 
03:31:49.229 --> 03:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
a note of is in construction most
 
03:31:50.469 --> 03:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
workers in New Hampshire choose to be
 
03:31:53.189 --> 03:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
non-union and we lead the uh region in
 
03:31:55.950 --> 03:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
terms of wages and benefits in fact uh
 
03:31:57.429 --> 03:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
construction unions in the state U
 
03:31:58.710 --> 03:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
represent less than 10% of the
 
03:32:00.750 --> 03:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
construction Workforce here and we
 
03:32:01.870 --> 03:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
believe that number is unlikely to
 
03:32:04.990 --> 03:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
change under Right to Work economic
 
03:32:07.429 --> 03:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
growth has been talked about a lot about
 
03:32:10.429 --> 03:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
other right work states so I'll forgo
 
03:32:11.790 --> 03:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
those comments
 
03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
and I just say I encourage you all to
 
03:32:15.750 --> 03:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
please uh put the individual first in
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%

co-pastor of the Meridan Congregational
 
03:33:28.830 --> 03:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
Church here in Meridan and um you will
 
03:33:31.550 --> 03:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
you have received already testimony from
 
03:33:33.630 --> 03:33:33.640 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Council of churches
 
03:33:36.950 --> 03:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
in opposition to sp61 I I joined them
 
03:33:39.030 --> 03:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
and and my colleague Reverend Gail Kenny
 
03:33:40.910 --> 03:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
will say more following me so I don't
 
03:33:42.990 --> 03:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
want to be redundant but what I want to
 
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
Simply say is to really ask us to look
 
03:33:51.070 --> 03:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
at the the morality of sp61 and it's one
 
03:33:53.309 --> 03:33:53.319 align:start position:0%
rarely have I seen a bill that is so
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
avowedly immoral from from its beginning
 
03:34:00.550 --> 03:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
so the the um creators of this bill
 
03:34:03.790 --> 03:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
obviously rightly I I presume believe
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
that we care about workers and so they
 
03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
falsely disingenuously called it a right
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
to work knowing full well it has nothing
 
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
to do with the right to work but
 
03:34:14.670 --> 03:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
thinking people will respond well to
 
03:34:17.429 --> 03:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
that and in fact everybody I've talked
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
to the vast majority of my congregation
 
03:34:21.150 --> 03:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
when it's explained that right to work
 
03:34:23.429 --> 03:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
isn't about right to work really that
 
03:34:26.429 --> 03:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
it's really about uh uh limiting the
 
03:34:28.670 --> 03:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
power of labor unions is not in
 
03:34:30.670 --> 03:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
supportive of it so it's really I would
 
03:34:32.670 --> 03:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
ask you to consider why is it that the
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
presenters can't be honest with you and
 
03:34:36.229 --> 03:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
tell you this is about the right to
 
03:34:38.349 --> 03:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
exploit workers maybe you'd still vote
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
for it but at least you'd know what you
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be lying to pretending
 
03:34:43.269 --> 03:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
that they're supporting they're helping
 
03:34:45.510 --> 03:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
workers someone asked earlier why is it
 
03:34:46.950 --> 03:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
that the majority of workers we hear
 
03:34:48.510 --> 03:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
from are opposed to this the majority of
 
03:34:50.910 --> 03:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
employ and and many employers are for it
 
03:34:52.750 --> 03:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
that tells you something as
 
03:34:57.070 --> 03:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
well the what are what are we afraid of
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
Are We afraid that if people have the
 
03:35:03.070 --> 03:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
right to organize and and uh for for
 
03:35:04.750 --> 03:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
better working conditions they'll
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
achieve them I would hope so labor
 
03:35:09.189 --> 03:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
unions are not over represented in this
 
03:35:10.670 --> 03:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
country of anything that they're they
 
03:35:12.150 --> 03:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
power is weaken and yet many of the
 
03:35:14.429 --> 03:35:14.439 align:start position:0%
advantages we take for granted wouldn't
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
be here if it were not for active
 
03:35:19.670 --> 03:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
organizing and the silly argument about
 
03:35:21.389 --> 03:35:21.399 align:start position:0%
people having the right not to pay I
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
mean that's as crazy as if I I go up to
 
03:35:25.389 --> 03:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
a toll booth and I say you know what I
 
03:35:26.990 --> 03:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
believe in the right to ride I'm not
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
gonna pay you know I I should have my
 
03:35:30.590 --> 03:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
choice the highways are here I should be
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
able to ride on them whether I pay it's
 
03:35:33.429 --> 03:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
a silly argument you know that as well
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
as we do that this is not about the
 
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
right to work it's not about freedom of
 
03:35:39.910 --> 03:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
workers it's about and the only reason
 
03:35:41.950 --> 03:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
that so many employees and and so much
 
03:35:43.710 --> 03:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
money is pouring in from outside of the
 
03:35:47.389 --> 03:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
state is because of an an active an
 
03:35:49.189 --> 03:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
understanding that the more we can limit
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
the power of workers the more worker
 
03:35:53.189 --> 03:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
power can be limited limited the more
 
03:35:55.630 --> 03:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
business can Thrive that's not right for
 
03:35:57.389 --> 03:35:57.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New Hampshire has defeated
 
03:35:59.710 --> 03:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
this time and again and I urge New
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because right to work is
 
03:36:03.630 --> 03:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
morally wrong for New Hampshire it's
 
03:36:06.269 --> 03:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
morally wrong for anyone and I strongly
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
urge that you vote it I think it's itl
 
03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to leg

Church of Christ and I speak today on
 
03:37:26.070 --> 03:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of the economic Justice team of
 
03:37:27.670 --> 03:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
this particular New Hampshire
 
03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
denomination and we are the largest
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
Protestant denomination in the state of
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire leaders within multiple
 
03:37:36.309 --> 03:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
Faith Traditions from Protestants to
 
03:37:38.550 --> 03:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
Catholics to Jews and more have been
 
03:37:40.389 --> 03:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
vigorous in their opposition to these
 
03:37:42.429 --> 03:37:42.439 align:start position:0%
bills for multiple reasons and you heard
 
03:37:44.590 --> 03:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
from the the Catholic dasis already this
 
03:37:46.990 --> 03:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
morning um our faith leads us to
 
03:37:49.469 --> 03:37:49.479 align:start position:0%
understand that all work has value and
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
that all workers have a right to dignity
 
03:37:53.950 --> 03:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
and respect our faith leads us to
 
03:37:55.150 --> 03:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
understand that workers deserve to have
 
03:37:57.510 --> 03:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
a voice on the job and the right to come
 
03:37:59.830 --> 03:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
together collectively we also believe
 
03:38:02.590 --> 03:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire employers involved in
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining have the right to
 
03:38:05.309 --> 03:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
deal with their workers at the
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
bargaining table without the heavy hand
 
03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the legislature interfering in very
 
03:38:13.229 --> 03:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
specific contractual decisions U but
 
03:38:15.349 --> 03:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what this bill would do
 
03:38:16.990 --> 03:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
so our faith is grounded in some
 
03:38:18.830 --> 03:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
foundational Commandments and one of
 
03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
them is Thou shalt not bear false
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
witness but unfortunately you've heard
 
03:38:25.830 --> 03:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
some false witness about this bill not
 
03:38:28.590 --> 03:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
just on this time around but for the
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
last four decades and no matter what is
 
03:38:33.070 --> 03:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
claimed by the Bill's proponents the
 
03:38:36.429 --> 03:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
primary purpose and the primary hopes um
 
03:38:38.590 --> 03:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
behind this bill are that workers would
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
be divided and that somehow that this
 
03:38:43.110 --> 03:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
could help Union strength and
 
03:38:45.189 --> 03:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
 the effectiveness of collective
 
03:38:47.469 --> 03:38:47.479 align:start position:0%
bargaining by encouraging workers not to
 
03:38:49.990 --> 03:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
pay union dues even though they might
 
03:38:52.189 --> 03:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
benefit mightily from a union bargain
 
03:38:53.750 --> 03:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
contract or Union handle workplace
 
03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
grievances so this bill comes to us year
 
03:38:58.510 --> 03:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
after year from the well-healed Virginia
 
03:39:01.510 --> 03:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and um we've heard again over
 
03:39:04.510 --> 03:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
the decades wild claims about employers
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
just waiting at New Hampshire's Gates so
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
to speak to set up shop in our state if
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
such a law is passed
 
03:39:13.229 --> 03:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
but no one has ever been able to
 
03:39:16.189 --> 03:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
legitimately identify a single business
 
03:39:17.790 --> 03:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
that has that intent that's just again
 
03:39:20.429 --> 03:39:20.439 align:start position:0%
waiting at the gates so if the out ofate
 
03:39:22.630 --> 03:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
architects of this bill want uh want to
 
03:39:24.870 --> 03:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
come to you bearing the total truth they
 
03:39:26.790 --> 03:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
would divulge the history of where this
 
03:39:28.830 --> 03:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
policy and where this concept came from
 
03:39:31.150 --> 03:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
and I would just ask do you know the
 
03:39:33.229 --> 03:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
history of so-called right to work and
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
if not I believe you should before you
 
03:39:38.349 --> 03:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
vote and the truth is um the historical
 
03:39:40.070 --> 03:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
truth is the right to work laws bubbled
 
03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
up in the Jim Crow South in the 1940s
 
03:39:45.870 --> 03:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
and Beyond these laws were all about
 
03:39:48.550 --> 03:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
trying to put a a divide between black
 
03:39:50.670 --> 03:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
workers and white workers when there was
 
03:39:52.269 --> 03:39:52.279 align:start position:0%
any hint that they might come together
 
03:39:54.389 --> 03:39:54.399 align:start position:0%
to unionize and one of the key
 
03:39:56.349 --> 03:39:56.359 align:start position:0%
architects of of these laws was a
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
wealthy industrialist and lobbyist from
 
03:40:01.710 --> 03:40:01.720 align:start position:0%
Texas named Vance Muse academics have
 
03:40:04.590 --> 03:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
described his efforts as an anti-labor
 
03:40:07.110 --> 03:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
Crusade on in a US Senate hearing Mr
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
Muse once said proudly I'm a southerner
 
03:40:12.070 --> 03:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm a white supremacist and his
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
literature promoting these laws included
 
03:40:16.750 --> 03:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
a sickening statement and I want to ask
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
for your forgiveness in advance for
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
repeating his words U but I think that
 
03:40:24.349 --> 03:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
you need to hear them um he said that if
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
right to work laws were not passed then
 
03:40:31.150 --> 03:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
quote white women and white men will be
 
03:40:34.150 --> 03:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
forced into organizations meaning unions
 
03:40:37.349 --> 03:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
with black African Apes whom they will
 
03:40:40.349 --> 03:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
have to call brother or lose their jobs
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the end of the quote that is
 
03:40:45.389 --> 03:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
where this law comes from that is where
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
it bubbled up and early on The
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
Architects of these laws decided to very
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
deceptively label their concept right to
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
work because who could be against the
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
right to work to their you know total
 
03:41:02.830 --> 03:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
Delight their idea about these laws
 
03:41:06.189 --> 03:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
worked these laws pit workers against
 
03:41:08.590 --> 03:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
one another and drastically diminished
 
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
workers ability to collectiv bargain
 
03:41:13.389 --> 03:41:13.399 align:start position:0%
effectively because they were divided
 
03:41:15.189 --> 03:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
between people who chose to pay and
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
people who didn't want to pay and again
 
03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
starting out with dividing black and
 
03:41:22.349 --> 03:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
white um so what did that mean after
 
03:41:24.309 --> 03:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
workers were divided it didn't happen
 
03:41:26.750 --> 03:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
overnight but when those divisions occur
 
03:41:30.189 --> 03:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
over time it meant lower wages because
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
of weaker bargaining power fewer
 
03:41:35.550 --> 03:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
benefits less safe workplaces and so
 
03:41:38.070 --> 03:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
ever since Vance sm's day corporate
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
interests that want to keep wages is low
 
03:41:42.670 --> 03:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
and want to keep workers voiceless have
 
03:41:45.070 --> 03:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
spent untold amounts of money and I
 
03:41:46.630 --> 03:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
don't have a figure but thinking about
 
03:41:48.750 --> 03:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
just 40 years focused on New Hampshire
 
03:41:50.990 --> 03:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
with all the mailings all the all the
 
03:41:54.429 --> 03:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
efforts um all the the Slick materials
 
03:41:56.910 --> 03:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
um is been a lot of money and we are
 
03:41:58.389 --> 03:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
just one state of many that they've
 
03:42:01.229 --> 03:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
targeted so these out of sters again for
 
03:42:04.149 --> 03:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
the past 40 years have believed that you
 
03:42:05.990 --> 03:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislators are
 
03:42:07.950 --> 03:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
particularly susceptible to their false
 
03:42:11.110 --> 03:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
witness um so we hear words about
 
03:42:12.750 --> 03:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
Freedom that's part of the false witness
 
03:42:14.429 --> 03:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
so I want to close by just saying a few
 
03:42:16.830 --> 03:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
things about Freedom so workers already
 
03:42:18.790 --> 03:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
have the freedom to vote democratically
 
03:42:19.990 --> 03:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they want to have a
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
union if they vote to form a union in
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
their workplace they have the freedom to
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
vote democratically on whether or not
 
03:42:26.950 --> 03:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
they want to fair share an agency's
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
clause in their contract New Hampshire
 
03:42:30.269 --> 03:42:30.279 align:start position:0%
workers have the freedom to choose
 
03:42:32.429 --> 03:42:32.439 align:start position:0%
whether or not to seek employment in a
 
03:42:34.630 --> 03:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
place where there already are democratic
 
03:42:36.870 --> 03:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
democratically formed unions and they
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
have a freedom to choose um to whether
 
03:42:42.110 --> 03:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
or not to seek employment in workplaces
 
03:42:44.349 --> 03:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
for example where there's a drug testing
 
03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
requirement or a background check
 
03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
requirement or other very significant
 
03:42:51.189 --> 03:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
requires for going to work there uh it's
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
already been legally established that no
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
worker can be forced um to become a
 
03:42:58.469 --> 03:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
member of your union and the freedom
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
exists even for relief from agency fees
 
03:43:03.389 --> 03:43:03.399 align:start position:0%
in certain circumstances and employers
 
03:43:05.110 --> 03:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
has the freedom to choose whether or not
 
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
to have a clause in their contract that
 
03:43:09.030 --> 03:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
addresses addresses agency fees or fair
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
share clauses
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
construction contractors have the
 
03:43:14.070 --> 03:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
freedom to choose whether or not to
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
enter into Partnerships with the
 
03:43:17.710 --> 03:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
construction unions so that the the
 
03:43:19.950 --> 03:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
union Bears major responsibility for
 
03:43:22.750 --> 03:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
employee screening and training in a way
 
03:43:24.030 --> 03:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
that makes the contractor more
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
productive and more competitive so if
 
03:43:28.429 --> 03:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
you prohibit these agreements one
 
03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
question I have and you should ask
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
yourselves how are you going to
 
03:43:34.389 --> 03:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
compensate the negatively affected
 
03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
contractors for what you're taking away
 
03:43:39.389 --> 03:43:39.399 align:start position:0%
from them and I'd say no New Hampshire
 
03:43:41.670 --> 03:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
employ employers with unionized
 
03:43:44.830 --> 03:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
employees are running to you pleading
 
03:43:47.710 --> 03:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
Save Me From Myself I'm incapable of
 
03:43:49.389 --> 03:43:49.399 align:start position:0%
making good decisions in collective
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
bargaining so I implore you please do
 
03:43:55.630 --> 03:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
not be swayed or manipulated by false
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
witness or from out of state spending I
 
03:44:00.790 --> 03:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
pray that you take to heart where this
 
03:44:02.750 --> 03:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill comes from and what it's really all
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
about and that you vote inexpedient to
 
03:44:07.110 --> 03:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
legislate and if the truths the many
 
03:44:09.389 --> 03:44:09.399 align:start position:0%
truths that you hear today from so many
 
03:44:11.670 --> 03:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
witnesses don't affect you then at least
 
03:44:14.070 --> 03:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that this bill has a real cost
 
03:44:16.710 --> 03:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
factor in terms of prosecutorial costs
 
03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
and investigative cost and it lacks a
 
03:44:21.550 --> 03:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so for that flaw alone I
 
03:44:22.910 --> 03:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
would just suggest that you send this
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
bill packing and I thank you for your
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
time thank you for your testimony there
 
03:44:31.160 --> 03:44:31.170 align:start position:0%

today to present to you a statement from
 
03:45:43.469 --> 03:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
Mark Dixon who is the a professor and
 
03:45:45.309 --> 03:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
chair of the sociology department at
 
03:45:47.429 --> 03:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College and is unable to be
 
03:45:50.070 --> 03:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
here today so I I'll read this into the
 
03:45:51.750 --> 03:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
record and then afterward I'll send you
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
a copy of Professor Dixon is the author
 
03:45:57.790 --> 03:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
most recently of Heartland Blues labor
 
03:45:59.710 --> 03:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
rights in the industrial Midwest
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
published last year and he says uh I
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
have been writing and teaching on labor
 
03:46:07.950 --> 03:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
issues for the last 15 years my research
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
on Right to Work provides an historical
 
03:46:13.710 --> 03:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
perspective on Senate Bill
 
03:46:16.630 --> 03:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
61 Right to Work Advocates sometimes
 
03:46:19.830 --> 03:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
presented as a job growth strategy or a
 
03:46:21.309 --> 03:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
means to protect the rights of
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
individual employees historical evidence
 
03:46:26.830 --> 03:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
suggests otherwise Right to Work
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
originated as a tool to curb new Union
 
03:46:32.349 --> 03:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
organizing efforts and to destabilize
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
existing unions in the 1940s as well as
 
03:46:38.070 --> 03:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
today the financial support for right to
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
work has come from those more interested
 
03:46:43.149 --> 03:46:43.159 align:start position:0%
in weakening unions than in job growth
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
or considering how labor law might
 
03:46:46.990 --> 03:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
effectively balance the interest of
 
03:46:50.110 --> 03:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
employers employees and labor
 
03:46:52.790 --> 03:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
organizations the first state campaigns
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
for Right to Work were in
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
1944 when unemployment dipped below 2%
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
nationally and average workers had real
 
03:47:03.670 --> 03:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
economic leverage anti- Roosevelt
 
03:47:06.070 --> 03:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
organizations at The Fringe of American
 
03:47:08.309 --> 03:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
politics were the first to take up the
 
03:47:11.110 --> 03:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
issue following World War II mainstream
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
business associations such as the
 
03:47:15.070 --> 03:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce and the National
 
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
Association of Manufacturers
 
03:47:19.389 --> 03:47:19.399 align:start position:0%
increasingly pushed for state laws to
 
03:47:22.349 --> 03:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
slow down a growing union movement union
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
membership had grown fivefold between
 
03:47:27.670 --> 03:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
1935 and the end of the war in my
 
03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
research I find that states were more
 
03:47:32.070 --> 03:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
likely to adopt right to work laws
 
03:47:35.389 --> 03:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
during the 1940s and 1950s if they had
 
03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
active Union organizing campaigns
 
03:47:39.790 --> 03:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
particularly in the south were
 
03:47:42.510 --> 03:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
organizing brought the potential of
 
03:47:44.910 --> 03:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
integration and if employers themselves
 
03:47:47.110 --> 03:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
were organized and active in politics in
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
short the emergence of right to work was
 
03:47:53.309 --> 03:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
about weakening a political
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
adversary there is little historical
 
03:47:57.990 --> 03:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
evidence to support right to work as a
 
03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
means of protecting the rights of
 
03:48:02.429 --> 03:48:02.439 align:start position:0%
individual employees and union members I
 
03:48:04.590 --> 03:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
just want to repeat that line there is
 
03:48:06.870 --> 03:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
little historical evidence to support
 
03:48:08.990 --> 03:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
right to work as a means of protecting
 
03:48:10.149 --> 03:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
the right
 
03:48:12.189 --> 03:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
of individual employees and union
 
03:48:15.189 --> 03:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
members for example the Taft heartley
 
03:48:18.309 --> 03:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
Act of 1947 originally mandated their
 
03:48:21.550 --> 03:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
workplace elections be held in non right
 
03:48:23.389 --> 03:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
to work states to determine whether to
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
Grant unions the ability to enter into a
 
03:48:28.510 --> 03:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
union shop agreement or to withdraw from
 
03:48:30.710 --> 03:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
Union shop agreements negotiated before
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
the act more than 90% of workers voted
 
03:48:36.349 --> 03:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
in favor of the Union shop the Mandate
 
03:48:38.910 --> 03:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
was dropped in 1951 after the near
 
03:48:41.550 --> 03:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
uniform support from workers the next
 
03:48:43.429 --> 03:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
uptick in Right to Work activity
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
followed the merge of the American
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
Federation of Labor and Congress
 
03:48:49.189 --> 03:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
industrial Congress of industrial
 
03:48:50.590 --> 03:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
organizations in
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
1955 again driven by business fears over
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
the strength of a unified labor movement
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
it was in this context that the National
 
03:49:00.349 --> 03:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
Association of
 
03:49:03.710 --> 03:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
Manufacturers popularized the term Big
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
labor the latest push for Right to Work
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
comes in a much different environment
 
03:49:10.550 --> 03:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
the percentage of workers belonging to
 
03:49:12.550 --> 03:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
unions has declined considerably since
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
its mid 20th century Peak a large body
 
03:49:17.429 --> 03:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
of research now documents how Union
 
03:49:20.349 --> 03:49:20.359 align:start position:0%
decline has contributed to increases in
 
03:49:23.110 --> 03:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
economic inequality and working poverty
 
03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
and to diminished social Mobility so why
 
03:49:30.070 --> 03:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
Target unions now consistent across both
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
periods however different is that right
 
03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
to work has been an important tool for
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
organized business it is a clear way to
 
03:49:39.630 --> 03:49:39.640 align:start position:0%
defund and destabilize a poli itical
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
opponent whereas the National
 
03:49:43.349 --> 03:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
Association of Manufacturers took the
 
03:49:45.149 --> 03:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
lead on providing model language on
 
03:49:47.710 --> 03:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
right to work in the 1950s the American
 
03:49:50.189 --> 03:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
legislative exchange Council has taken
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
up the mantle in recent decades the
 
03:49:54.349 --> 03:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
historical record on right to work's
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
primary use is clear and it is not the
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
protection of employee rights uh thank
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
you much Mr chairman uh I'm afraid I
 
03:50:05.429 --> 03:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
can't answer any questions directly on
 
03:50:07.710 --> 03:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
behalf of Professor Dixon but I will
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
send to you the statement and you can
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
get a hold of him uh if you would like
 
03:50:14.910 --> 03:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
to draw more on his expertise and uh
 
03:50:17.070 --> 03:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
I've I first testified against right to
 
03:50:18.510 --> 03:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
work in
 
03:50:20.870 --> 03:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
1983 possibly before any of you were
 
03:50:24.070 --> 03:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
even in the legislature uh so I could
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
say a word or two on my own behalf if
 
03:50:27.469 --> 03:50:27.479 align:start position:0%
you had any other
 
03:50:29.550 --> 03:50:29.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
03:50:33.790 --> 03:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
presenter in the

agency but I am here representing myself
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
today uh with experience I have about
 
03:52:42.149 --> 03:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
this matter including my former time
 
03:52:46.670 --> 03:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
working at the New Hampshire's job CP I
 
03:52:49.349 --> 03:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
oppose passage of this Right to Work
 
03:52:52.830 --> 03:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
bill my testimony will be condensed out
 
03:52:54.990 --> 03:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
of respect for yours and the other
 
03:52:55.000 --> 03:52:59.070 align:start position:0%

03:52:59.070 --> 03:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:01.309 --> 03:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
time when reviewing the text of this
 
03:53:03.149 --> 03:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
bill proponents State clearly their
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
intent is to maximize freedom of choice
 
03:53:09.630 --> 03:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
and pursuit of employment
 
03:53:11.590 --> 03:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
that Viewpoint in my observation is
 
03:53:14.830 --> 03:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
short-sided and is a
 
03:53:17.070 --> 03:53:17.080 align:start position:0%
disservice to Workforce Development
 
03:53:19.269 --> 03:53:19.279 align:start position:0%
efforts being made in New Hampshire and
 
03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
does not actually encourage an
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
employment climate conductive to
 
03:53:24.359 --> 03:53:26.750 align:start position:0%
employment climate conductive to
economic

03:53:26.750 --> 03:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
economic
 
03:53:29.070 --> 03:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
growth my role was to network with
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
businesses across New England and to
 
03:53:35.830 --> 03:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
assist trade graduates with obtaining
 
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
employment their trades range from
 
03:53:39.870 --> 03:53:39.880 align:start position:0%

other
 
03:53:48.189 --> 03:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
trades we had goals for which targets we
 
03:53:49.950 --> 03:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
should expect graduates to be able to
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
hit considering the importance of adding
 
03:53:53.670 --> 03:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
those skill sets to our state's
 
03:53:56.510 --> 03:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
economy New Hampshire is primarily a
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
small business State uh it's no secret
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing industry is aging and
 
03:54:04.510 --> 03:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
is in desperate need of younger workers
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
in most if not all of the job placements
 
03:54:09.550 --> 03:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
I was involved in uh in order for our
 
03:54:12.990 --> 03:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
graduates to hit program wage goals uh
 
03:54:15.429 --> 03:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
which in New Hampshire are lower than
 
03:54:17.950 --> 03:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
some of those goals of other neighboring
 
03:54:19.309 --> 03:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
states in New
 
03:54:22.149 --> 03:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
England um they would have to work
 
03:54:25.070 --> 03:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
overtime overnight with differential pay
 
03:54:27.030 --> 03:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
or relocate to other
 
03:54:27.040 --> 03:54:28.550 align:start position:0%
or relocate to other
states

03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:54:28.560 --> 03:54:30.670 align:start position:0%
states
um

03:54:30.670 --> 03:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
whereas the union jobs that the
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
graduates would uh would
 
03:54:39.189 --> 03:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
get um would tend to be some of the the
 
03:54:43.030 --> 03:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
best job placements that we could
 
03:54:45.910 --> 03:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
find what they've offered to the workers
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
and what effect uh unions have on our
 
03:54:54.269 --> 03:54:54.279 align:start position:0%
economy outweighs the supposed negatives
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh with uh you know as stated by other
 
03:55:04.670 --> 03:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.750 --> 03:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
dues uh it's not surprising to see right
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
to work taken up in the legislature
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
given the current composition however I
 
03:55:15.550 --> 03:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
would implore you to consider these
 
03:55:15.560 --> 03:55:18.950 align:start position:0%
would implore you to consider these
economic

03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
downsides uh I'm available for any
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
questions but I can't guarantee I have
 
03:55:26.510 --> 03:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
information sufficient uh to answer them
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
as I'm uh no longer in that kind of a
 
03:55:32.309 --> 03:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
role this time but I do appreciate you
 
03:55:36.189 --> 03:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
out thank you for your testimony any
 
03:55:40.189 --> 03:55:40.199 align:start position:0%

ibw and it's no secret it's it's been a
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
tough year for uh New Hampshire
 
03:57:12.910 --> 03:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
Electrical Workers throughout this
 
03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic thousands of members
 
03:57:17.349 --> 03:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
from International Brotherhood
 
03:57:19.990 --> 03:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
Electrical Workers have shown up each
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
day to ensure the light stay on our
 
03:57:25.630 --> 03:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
members have been regarded for decades
 
03:57:28.030 --> 03:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
as some of the highest quality hardest
 
03:57:30.189 --> 03:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
working linemen in the state and for
 
03:57:32.670 --> 03:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
good reason every year dozens of
 
03:57:35.149 --> 03:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
hardworking union members graduate from
 
03:57:37.389 --> 03:57:37.399 align:start position:0%
the ibw local 104's apprenticeship
 
03:57:39.510 --> 03:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
program located in barington New
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the program is part of a
 
03:57:43.510 --> 03:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
longstanding partnership with the
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
northeastern apprenticeship and training
 
03:57:48.670 --> 03:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
once members who also are paid during
 
03:57:50.269 --> 03:57:50.279 align:start position:0%
the duration of their apprenticeship
 
03:57:53.429 --> 03:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
graduate they are fully prepared and for
 
03:57:55.349 --> 03:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
a rewarding career as a journey and
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
lineman not only do they guaranteed jobs
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
with one of the uh ibw signatory
 
03:58:02.670 --> 03:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
contractors they also have the
 
03:58:04.110 --> 03:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to travel with their
 
03:58:06.910 --> 03:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized do
 
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
certificate um why am I telling you this
 
03:58:11.790 --> 03:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire lawmakers are in
 
03:58:13.750 --> 03:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
the process of hearing a bill that would
 
03:58:15.870 --> 03:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
directly weaken this program and
 
03:58:17.790 --> 03:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
programs like it across the
 
03:58:21.670 --> 03:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
state if sb61 is passed Right to Work
 
03:58:23.630 --> 03:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
bill would dramatically weaken private
 
03:58:26.990 --> 03:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
unions such as ibw 104 we have worked
 
03:58:29.309 --> 03:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
for over a century at no cost to
 
03:58:31.510 --> 03:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers build relationship with
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
contractors across New England who know
 
03:58:36.149 --> 03:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
when they hire workers from us they are
 
03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
getting highly skilled hardworking
 
03:58:37.880 --> 03:58:39.790 align:start position:0%
getting highly skilled hardworking
employees

03:58:39.790 --> 03:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
employees
 
03:58:42.189 --> 03:58:42.199 align:start position:0%
um I have other stuff but you've heard
 
03:58:44.070 --> 03:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
all of it about the statistics so i'
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
just like to say also as a a line
 
03:58:49.950 --> 03:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
worker um our members perform work for
 
03:58:49.960 --> 03:58:50.950 align:start position:0%
worker um our members perform work for
several

03:58:50.950 --> 03:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
several
 
03:58:54.349 --> 03:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
utilities that not only uh have uh
 
03:58:56.670 --> 03:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
property in New Hampshire but also have
 
03:58:59.950 --> 03:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
property in other New England states so
 
03:59:01.950 --> 03:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
when one of our contractors was awarded
 
03:59:05.870 --> 03:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
a a pro a contract say from eversource
 
03:59:08.510 --> 03:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
that contract is for the entire property
 
03:59:12.030 --> 03:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
and my concern is if a uh employee from
 
03:59:14.149 --> 03:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire decides to become a
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
non-paying member and then while working
 
03:59:20.990 --> 03:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
on a project in New Hampshire what
 
03:59:23.469 --> 03:59:23.479 align:start position:0%
happens to that individual when the next
 
03:59:30.550 --> 03:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:32.590 --> 03:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and thank you for

03:59:39.830 --> 03:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions for
 
03:59:43.950 --> 03:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:47.349 --> 03:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
Zoom seeing none any in the
 
03:59:51.070 --> 03:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
L Vice chairman seor thank you Mr
 
03:59:54.510 --> 03:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and um thank you Mr eaten for
 
03:59:57.710 --> 03:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
your presentation my question is if you
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
know if you have a sense of for the
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
contracts that you negotiate in New
 
04:00:08.830 --> 04:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how many require agency fees
 
04:00:08.840 --> 04:00:10.229 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how many require agency fees
from

04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
non-members as a percentage and
 
04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
generally what
 
04:00:17.149 --> 04:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
percentage uh would you say of the
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
employees that you represent are
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
non-members that pay agency
 
04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
Fe I would I would say that on the uh
 
04:00:32.429 --> 04:00:32.439 align:start position:0%
the hiring Hall part of uh Local 104
 
04:00:35.950 --> 04:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
there's 100% union membership by choice
 
04:00:39.070 --> 04:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
I mean nobody's uh request wed paying
 
04:00:40.990 --> 04:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
agency fee or any of
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
that again my concern though is when we
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
again work for just say ABC Electric and
 
04:00:50.309 --> 04:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
again the first project may be in
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and that that
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
project's completed for ever Source you
 
04:00:57.149 --> 04:00:57.159 align:start position:0%
could be assigned to a job say in
 
04:00:59.389 --> 04:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
Hoppington Massachusetts so if
 
04:01:03.670 --> 04:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
somebody's a uh non uh fee paying or
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to pay dues I mean the only
 
04:01:09.590 --> 04:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
Al alternative for them is to be let go
 
04:01:11.550 --> 04:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
when they move to the next
 
04:01:14.269 --> 04:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
project and this happen not only osource
 
04:01:16.429 --> 04:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
National Grid Liberty they all have
 
04:01:20.670 --> 04:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:22.990 --> 04:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
now thank
 
04:01:25.790 --> 04:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
you J did I see your hand raised yes
 
04:01:28.389 --> 04:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
04:01:30.870 --> 04:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
Eaton um you mentioned you currently
 
04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
have 100% union membership uh
 
04:01:37.750 --> 04:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
voluntarily no agency fees uh if right
 
04:01:39.469 --> 04:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
this current bill right to work were to
 
04:01:42.510 --> 04:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
go through what do you believe your the
 
04:01:44.590 --> 04:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of union membership would be
 
04:01:47.550 --> 04:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
following passage Right to
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
Work Well I I would I would hope it
 
04:01:53.550 --> 04:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
would be 100% but my again my concern
 
04:01:57.189 --> 04:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
would be more for that a a New Hampshire
 
04:01:57.199 --> 04:01:58.349 align:start position:0%
would be more for that a a New Hampshire
uh

04:01:58.349 --> 04:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
resident could
 
04:02:04.149 --> 04:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
be again only and if he's working for a
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
contractor the contractor can't say the
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh eversource or National Grid listen I
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
got some people that they can only work
 
04:02:12.429 --> 04:02:12.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I mean the contract is
 
04:02:14.349 --> 04:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
a blanket agreement that you work for
 
04:02:17.070 --> 04:02:17.080 align:start position:0%
ever Source where they where they so
 
04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
choose so my concern would be these
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
people would be left out they'd be they
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
laid off they could even be terminated
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
for not being able to fulfill what
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to in the
 
04:02:30.990 --> 04:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
contract now go into an area where again
 
04:02:35.710 --> 04:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.750 --> 04:02:38.760 align:start position:0%

union family and we have been for over
 
04:04:14.560 --> 04:04:16.070 align:start position:0%
union family and we have been for over
40

04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
40
 
04:04:19.030 --> 04:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
years it was the union wages that kept
 
04:04:22.229 --> 04:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
us above water during the tough
 
04:04:25.349 --> 04:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
times because the union members fought
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
for higher Wagers better benefits and
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
non-union um households profited
 
04:04:41.469 --> 04:04:41.479 align:start position:0%
remember no workers are forced to work
 
04:04:44.830 --> 04:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
for a union company it's their choice if
 
04:04:47.229 --> 04:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
they don't want to pay union dues don't
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
work for a union
 
04:04:52.590 --> 04:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
company please don't send our state
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
citizens backwards when you cast your
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
vote please think about your neighbors
 
04:05:01.349 --> 04:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
your friends and your Town's people can
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
they afford to lose income wages will go
 
04:05:09.790 --> 04:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
down we see that in other right to work
 
04:05:11.790 --> 04:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
states around this
 
04:05:14.590 --> 04:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
country not all of them make respectable
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
living wages is that what you and your
 
04:05:20.950 --> 04:05:20.960 align:start position:0%

04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
falter and as I see Thomas Walter is
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak I assume you're
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
going to uh share the same connection so
 
04:06:25.389 --> 04:06:25.399 align:start position:0%
I would recognize thas falter
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
next Mr chairman a question not related
 
04:06:32.510 --> 04:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
to the uh and before you start yes
 
04:06:35.229 --> 04:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
what's the uh do we intend on taking any
 
04:06:38.790 --> 04:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
kind of a break at at some point or so
 
04:06:43.149 --> 04:06:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh I slid in here the um because the
 
04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
chairman had planned to take his lunch
 
04:06:48.429 --> 04:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
break at once at one and I think that
 
04:06:51.389 --> 04:06:51.399 align:start position:0%
was his plan for today rather than break
 
04:06:55.710 --> 04:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
the session for lunch uh to leave that
 
04:07:00.030 --> 04:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.990 --> 04:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
falter go
 
04:07:16.910 --> 04:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
ahead and you're muted again if you can
 
04:07:20.269 --> 04:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
unmute yourself we can't hear
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
you how's that can you hear me that's
 
04:07:25.229 --> 04:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
great you know we're not the greatest
 
04:07:27.070 --> 04:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
with electronics here you know I thought
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
I was trying to be helpful but I guess I
 
04:07:33.389 --> 04:07:33.399 align:start position:0%
wasn't now you've you've you've heard
 
04:07:35.309 --> 04:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
from a lot of eloquent speakers today
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll probably not be the most
 
04:07:40.349 --> 04:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
delegant but I have personal experience
 
04:07:43.269 --> 04:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
um and I'm a construction worker have
 
04:07:45.790 --> 04:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
been for over 40 years as Brenda told
 
04:07:49.510 --> 04:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
you uh and you know I've never heard
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
anybody on the job site say you know we
 
04:07:54.109 --> 04:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
need right to work this make a a life so
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
much better never once uh I'm from over
 
04:07:59.469 --> 04:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
in Greenville in the whips switch area
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of construction
 
04:08:02.830 --> 04:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
workers there well we're not talking
 
04:08:06.389 --> 04:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
about right to work you know some of the
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
things we are talking about unfunded
 
04:08:11.710 --> 04:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
mandates big that's big controversy I
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
hope you'll do something about that as
 
04:08:13.680 --> 04:08:15.550 align:start position:0%
hope you'll do something about that as
well

04:08:15.550 --> 04:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know schools you know those are
 
04:08:22.269 --> 04:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
the important things this this is comes
 
04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
up every year and and it drains a lot of
 
04:08:24.960 --> 04:08:26.830 align:start position:0%
up every year and and it drains a lot of
resources

04:08:26.830 --> 04:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
resources
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
so you know what what's the real reason
 
04:08:33.429 --> 04:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
for this uh you know why why do we have
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
to uh listen to it every year I mean
 
04:08:40.830 --> 04:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
there's choices to be made and the
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
Reverend made a good point you know we
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
have to pay our toll Greenville is still
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
a town meeting we come in we decide what
 
04:08:52.149 --> 04:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
we want we make those choices and we
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
decide how much money it's going to take
 
04:08:57.389 --> 04:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
and then we pay our taxes and those who
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't pay their taxes guess what happens
 
04:09:03.950 --> 04:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
to them I'm sure you know I so in my
 
04:09:06.670 --> 04:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
union I I pay for everything everything
 
04:09:08.469 --> 04:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
comes out of my pocket
 
04:09:10.389 --> 04:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
I decided what kind of programs we're
 
04:09:13.109 --> 04:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
going to have I decide I get a vote on
 
04:09:16.109 --> 04:09:16.119 align:start position:0%
my insurance I get a vote on my training
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
I have to do my own
 
04:09:20.910 --> 04:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
training I I don't get any holidays no
 
04:09:22.950 --> 04:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
holidays at all I don't get any vacation
 
04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
pay all comes out of my money absolutely
 
04:09:29.149 --> 04:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
no seniority I'm as good as my last
 
04:09:32.189 --> 04:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
paycheck that's the way it works so and
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
I've done this for a number of years and
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
I you know are there complainers sure
 
04:09:38.349 --> 04:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
there are you know this complaint is
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
about paying taxes this complaint is
 
04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
about paying tolls but so what's the
 
04:09:45.229 --> 04:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
right what's the real benefit how am I
 
04:09:47.710 --> 04:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
going to benefit from this and you know
 
04:09:48.870 --> 04:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
04:09:52.189 --> 04:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
reasons I have uh I'd like to go into is
 
04:09:54.790 --> 04:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
the right to work you know it it it's
 
04:09:56.830 --> 04:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
really taking away my
 
04:09:59.550 --> 04:09:59.560 align:start position:0%
rights uh you know and other and other
 
04:10:01.070 --> 04:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
people from New Hampshire their rights
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
as well the federal law already
 
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
already is enforced it's through the uh
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
ta back and you know in my union I know
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
if you don't even like we have a
 
04:10:15.070 --> 04:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
political action uh fund if you don't
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
want to pay into it if you have some
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
problems with uh with how they they're
 
04:10:22.510 --> 04:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
being uh spent you don't have to pay
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
into it you don't have to work for that
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
Union shop up there there's always
 
04:10:31.630 --> 04:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
choices so why why exactly are we
 
04:10:34.109 --> 04:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
adopting it I mean other states have
 
04:10:36.950 --> 04:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
adopted this and and and it's shown that
 
04:10:39.870 --> 04:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
working families suffer all the time how
 
04:10:43.469 --> 04:10:43.479 align:start position:0%
do they suffer they have lower pay uh
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
paying jobs much lower uh there's more
 
04:10:50.109 --> 04:10:50.119 align:start position:0%
Glenn bracket Mr Brackett he talked
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
about it more fatalities in the
 
04:10:55.630 --> 04:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
workplace so you have to ask you who's
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
pushing this I I don't see any I don't
 
04:11:00.189 --> 04:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
see any workers up here saying give me
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
right to work I only see special
 
04:11:04.030 --> 04:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
interest groups and they want to take
 
04:11:05.710 --> 04:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
away our civil and workplace rights from
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
our families so the answer to the
 
04:11:11.550 --> 04:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
question is they're just looking for
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
higher profits for themselves at the
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
expense of me the New Hampshire family
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
working person and even governor sonunu
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
in 2018 he said there's no need and I
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
heard that there's no need to pursue any
 
04:11:29.710 --> 04:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
additional legislation so why so what
 
04:11:33.910 --> 04:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
he's really saying is in other words why
 
04:11:36.510 --> 04:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
should government get involved in legal
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
matters relating to the contract between
 
04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
the employer and the employee why would
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
this body insert itself into the
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
marketplace with its thumb on the scale
 
04:11:48.429 --> 04:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
against the Working Families of New
 
04:11:50.790 --> 04:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so
 
04:11:50.800 --> 04:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so
why

04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:11:55.469 --> 04:11:55.479 align:start position:0%
why why do we need this that's really
 
04:11:57.229 --> 04:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
and and what's it going to do for me
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
because that's really what it is there's
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
many more of me we're construction

04:13:00.550 --> 04:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
few brief
 
04:13:00.560 --> 04:13:02.149 align:start position:0%
few brief
things

04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:13:05.469 --> 04:13:05.479 align:start position:0%
um uh take you know out of respect for
 
04:13:07.269 --> 04:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
your time and the the committee and
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
everybody else's time uh what I'd like
 
04:13:13.870 --> 04:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
to start with is I I I want to say that
 
04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that Mr vermi in his uh
 
04:13:19.830 --> 04:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
testimony in support of the
 
04:13:23.189 --> 04:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
bill uh mind you that I am opposed to
 
04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
the bill in his testimony and support of
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
the bill he
 
04:13:30.389 --> 04:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledged uh that
 
04:13:33.109 --> 04:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh that nobody can be forced to join a
 
04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
labor union and he also acknowledged the
 
04:13:39.109 --> 04:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
fact that that that this bill
 
04:13:43.109 --> 04:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
would uh create the existence of free
 
04:13:45.790 --> 04:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
free what he called free writers or I
 
04:13:48.510 --> 04:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
would refer to as Free Loaders but I'm
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
glad that he acknowledged that the other
 
04:13:52.990 --> 04:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to touch on is I believe
 
04:13:55.630 --> 04:13:55.640 align:start position:0%
representative turkot had asked the
 
04:14:01.109 --> 04:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
question um regarding uh money and money
 
04:14:04.550 --> 04:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
coming into the state to oppose this uh
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
and nobody has spoke on it yet but do
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
believe the union leader had some
 
04:14:12.429 --> 04:14:12.439 align:start position:0%
extensive reporting on the fact that Mr
 
04:14:12.439 --> 04:14:13.990 align:start position:0%
extensive reporting on the fact that Mr
Baker's

04:14:13.990 --> 04:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
Baker's
 
04:14:19.389 --> 04:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
organization uh I believe spent 10 uh
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
$100,000 with $10,000 contributions to
 
04:14:28.349 --> 04:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
10 uh members of the state senate uh in
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
support of this um so and then the other
 
04:14:34.750 --> 04:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
thing I I wish the chairman was here
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
because he um he's he's
 
04:14:46.349 --> 04:14:46.359 align:start position:0%
uh had a few questions regarding how um
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
Right to Work could affect us being a
 
04:14:52.269 --> 04:14:52.279 align:start position:0%
more unsafe
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
workplace uh in the state of New
 
04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and while I understand it's
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
anecdotal you know my daughter works for
 
04:15:04.670 --> 04:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
a uh well-known nationally recognized
 
04:15:08.710 --> 04:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
retailer that they're publicly traded
 
04:15:11.630 --> 04:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
she uh had to clean up some broken glass
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
and she cut her
 
04:15:16.870 --> 04:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
hand not only did they not even Pro
 
04:15:19.950 --> 04:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
offer her medical attention they didn't
 
04:15:21.630 --> 04:15:21.640 align:start position:0%
take an accident
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
report uh you know and and I can tell
 
04:15:28.510 --> 04:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
you where I work and I've been a a union
 
04:15:31.870 --> 04:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
member for close to 33 years where I
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
work that wouldn't have flown because
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
there's a check and balance with the
 
04:15:38.349 --> 04:15:38.359 align:start position:0%
Union there there there's somebody
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
looking to make sure that the company is
 
04:15:43.149 --> 04:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
going to follow the rules now where I
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
work I think the company's a great
 
04:15:46.990 --> 04:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
company and they would follow the rules
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
but it isn't always the case uh as you
 
04:15:53.630 --> 04:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
as you see here and so um you know
 
04:15:55.710 --> 04:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
there's that check to make sure okay
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
this this employee is going to fill out
 
04:16:01.070 --> 04:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
an accident report and um you know going
 
04:16:03.030 --> 04:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
to get the Med medical attention that
 
04:16:05.550 --> 04:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
that they need so those are a few of the
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
things that I I wanted to touch on uh
 
04:16:10.590 --> 04:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
that I've heard here this morning and
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
like I said um I'm going to you've got
 
04:16:15.469 --> 04:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
my written testimony but I I just want
 
04:16:18.429 --> 04:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
to touch on some of the more personal uh
 
04:16:21.109 --> 04:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
issues like I said I've been at my place
 
04:16:23.990 --> 04:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
of employment for nearly 33 years in
 
04:16:26.910 --> 04:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
that time I've been a member of my union
 
04:16:29.070 --> 04:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh at times I've held various leadership
 
04:16:31.590 --> 04:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
positions and in that time I've served
 
04:16:33.109 --> 04:16:33.119 align:start position:0%
on the bargaining committee and
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
participated in the negotiation of six
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements at no
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
time did my employer or a coworker ever
 
04:16:44.349 --> 04:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
propose what this ill intended
 
04:16:48.189 --> 04:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
legislation seeks to do which begs the
 
04:16:50.550 --> 04:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
question why would the government want
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
to insert itself into this process why
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
would you want to alter this component
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire
 
04:17:00.149 --> 04:17:00.159 align:start position:0%
Advantage thanks to my Union contract
 
04:17:02.670 --> 04:17:02.680 align:start position:0%

04:17:04.990 --> 04:17:05.000 align:start position:0%

04:17:07.389 --> 04:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
home at 23 years old I have the
 
04:17:09.710 --> 04:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
disposable income to take my family
 
04:17:13.510 --> 04:17:13.520 align:start position:0%

solution to a problem that doesn't exist

sp61 uh defendants of Right to Work

argue that it is about practicing

protecting the freedom of whether or not
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
workers can join a union well the truth
 
04:24:14.109 --> 04:24:14.119 align:start position:0%
is that always has been legally
 
04:24:16.910 --> 04:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
federally illegal to force anyone to
 
04:24:19.590 --> 04:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
join a union the real Freedom comes from
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunities you get when you join
 
04:24:24.750 --> 04:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
a union you get better wages health care
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
benefits and
 
04:24:29.309 --> 04:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
more because of what union members have
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
provided for our state we get to live
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%

04:24:37.630 --> 04:24:37.640 align:start position:0%

free with knowing union dues not taxes
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%

during a town hall the bottom line is
 
04:24:57.239 --> 04:24:58.269 align:start position:0%
during a town hall the bottom line is
really

04:24:58.269 --> 04:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:25:02.070 --> 04:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
simple we want out we want we went out
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
and passed right to work we got rid of
 
04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
prevailing wages
 
04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
we built Fields all over the place
 
04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
thinking corporations would come and
 
04:25:15.070 --> 04:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't come did they right now the
 
04:25:17.070 --> 04:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
same law that Governor Justice is
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
referring to right to work is up for the
 
04:25:22.590 --> 04:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
House vote in New Hampshire and here we
 
04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
have an elected official Governor
 
04:25:27.870 --> 04:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
Justice saying in plainest possible
 
04:25:29.710 --> 04:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
terms that we have known in New
 
04:25:32.269 --> 04:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for Generations that right to
 
04:25:34.229 --> 04:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
work is a law that provides neither
 
04:25:37.149 --> 04:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
rights nor work
 
04:25:38.750 --> 04:25:38.760 align:start position:0%

for 20 years being a part of a union and
 
04:26:50.349 --> 04:26:50.359 align:start position:0%
always knowing that the union has my
 
04:26:52.630 --> 04:26:52.640 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire motto is Live Free or Die
 
04:27:10.510 --> 04:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
being in a union and paying dues is for
 
04:27:11.910 --> 04:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
the union to collectively bargain on
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
your behalf it's no different than any
 
04:27:15.349 --> 04:27:15.359 align:start position:0%

running right to work actually has
 
04:27:36.670 --> 04:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with worker freedom and
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
everything to do with breaking organized
 
04:27:40.389 --> 04:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
labor and strengthening corporate
 
04:27:43.349 --> 04:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
control over politics workers have very
 
04:27:44.990 --> 04:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
little bargaining power in the United
 
04:27:46.990 --> 04:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
States in most developed countries
 
04:27:48.870 --> 04:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
workers have more say and working
 
04:27:50.950 --> 04:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
conditions tend to be better in America
 
04:27:52.630 --> 04:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
unless you're in a union the workplace
 
04:27:54.990 --> 04:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
Dynamic gives all the power to the owner
 
04:27:56.830 --> 04:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
the business interests if business
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
interests are not checked by the
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining power of labor unions and
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
other worker groups then we will become
 
04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
a developing country the safe
 
04:28:08.830 --> 04:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
the safest most um trained and skilled
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
labor is that of union labor we fight
 
04:28:13.030 --> 04:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
every day not just for union labor but
 
04:28:15.149 --> 04:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
for labor in general this so-called
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
Right to Work bill is nothing as it
 
04:28:19.109 --> 04:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
reads it is a right to work for Less
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
studies show that workers in right to
 
04:28:23.030 --> 04:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
work states make 10,000 less a year
 
04:28:25.630 --> 04:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
while the CEOs get 320 times richer off

the back of the workers unions make up
 
04:28:30.389 --> 04:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
7% of the workforce in this country in
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
the construction field it's about 4%
 
04:28:34.630 --> 04:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
this country was built on union labor
 
04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
it's because of organ organized labor
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
and the right to collect collectively
 
04:28:40.590 --> 04:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
bargain is why we have eight hour work
 
04:28:43.389 --> 04:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
days 5ay work weeks and 40-hour work
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
weeks sick leave Etc this is why we have
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
the safest workers and work sites going
 
04:28:50.229 --> 04:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
today and this is all factual
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
information working people in right to
 
04:28:54.309 --> 04:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
work states have consistently lower
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
quality of life when you compare right
 
04:28:57.790 --> 04:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
to work states and free bargaining
 
04:28:59.229 --> 04:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
States the differences are not
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
comparable they have less Access to
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
Health Care poor education systems for
 
04:29:05.950 --> 04:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
children the poverty rate is higher and
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
the risk of workplace fatalities is 49%
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
higher when working people can't freely
 
04:29:13.309 --> 04:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
speak up together they can't negotiate
 
04:29:15.550 --> 04:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
for higher safety standards better
 
04:29:18.189 --> 04:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
training Fair wages and health benefits
 
04:29:20.349 --> 04:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
and this will impact all of us Union and
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
non-union alike right to work will lower
 
04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
wages cause higher workplace injuries
 
04:29:28.750 --> 04:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
and increase poverty will this make our
 
04:29:31.030 --> 04:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
will this make our state more attractive
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I urge you to vote no
 
04:29:37.830 --> 04:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
on S sp61 right to work is wrong for New
 
04:29:40.630 --> 04:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm open to any questions
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%

1837 I was elected by the members who
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
work in the electric utility industry
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
these are the people who restore your
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
power after storms disable the electric
 
04:34:27.439 --> 04:34:29.510 align:start position:0%
power after storms disable the electric
distribution

04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
04:34:33.310 --> 04:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
system safety and training are our top
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
priorities we work cooperative with the
 
04:34:37.789 --> 04:34:37.799 align:start position:0%
electric utilities in the Manchester
 
04:34:40.109 --> 04:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
Community College to build a Workforce
 
04:34:41.709 --> 04:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire through the best
 
04:34:41.719 --> 04:34:45.590 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire through the best
apprenticeships

04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.869 --> 04:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
available s sp61 is simply wrong for New
 
04:34:53.310 --> 04:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let's be clear nobody can be
 
04:34:55.990 --> 04:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
forced to join my union that's already
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
against the law that's a simple fact
 
04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
remember as others have told you already
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
nobody can be forced to join my union
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's against the
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
law however unions are required to
 
04:35:13.390 --> 04:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
service non-members at the expense of
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
the existing
 
04:35:18.510 --> 04:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
members that's just patently
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
unfair uh negotiating administering
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
contracts and protecting workers wages
 
04:35:25.470 --> 04:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
and benefits cost
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
money why why would we want to force
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
some people to
 
04:35:35.029 --> 04:35:35.039 align:start position:0%
pay and allow others to ride for free it
 
04:35:36.189 --> 04:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
just just it's just not the New
 
04:35:36.199 --> 04:35:39.310 align:start position:0%
just just it's just not the New
Hampshire

04:35:39.310 --> 04:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:43.269 --> 04:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
way currently non-union members can only
 
04:35:45.830 --> 04:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
be required to pay their fair share for
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
these vital
 
04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
Services what's wrong with paying your
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
fair share when you're when you're
 
04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
getting the benefit of the
 
04:35:56.910 --> 04:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
services the only purpose of this bill
 
04:35:59.230 --> 04:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
is to increase corporate power at the
 
04:36:01.869 --> 04:36:01.879 align:start position:0%
expense of working
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
people obviously wages and benefits will
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
erode faster or grow slower if
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
corporations are empowered and
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining rights are
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
eroded we've heard this the statistics
 
04:36:16.470 --> 04:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
but the point is
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
obvious Corporation corporate power
 
04:36:21.869 --> 04:36:21.879 align:start position:0%
wants to reduce the unions and that will
 
04:36:23.789 --> 04:36:23.799 align:start position:0%
hurt Working Families and hurt working
 
04:36:26.510 --> 04:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
people across the
 
04:36:30.150 --> 04:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
state I ask you to reject sb61 as New
 
04:36:33.150 --> 04:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has done in a bipartisan way
 
04:36:35.070 --> 04:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
every time it's come up over the last 4
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
40 plus
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
years for 40 years we've been working
 
04:36:42.029 --> 04:36:42.039 align:start position:0%
bipartisan to to defeat this bad
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
legislation please continue to do
 
04:36:48.349 --> 04:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
time thank you for your testimony are
 
04:36:53.551 --> 04:36:53.561 align:start position:0%

repelled in
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
1947 um I just don't think it's good for
 
04:39:25.910 --> 04:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Working Families as you
 
04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%

04:39:29.789 --> 04:39:29.799 align:start position:0%
who have signed up in opposition to this
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
that far outweigh the um people who are
 
04:39:35.070 --> 04:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
in favor for it and you know
 
04:39:37.750 --> 04:39:37.760 align:start position:0%

you guys are voices for the people of
 
04:39:56.310 --> 04:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I just don't think it's
 
04:39:58.230 --> 04:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
good for New Hampshire um you know
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's been talks that businesses can't
 
04:40:02.350 --> 04:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
engage with
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
their union members um once they have
 
04:40:07.030 --> 04:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
them on the job site that's who they do
 
04:40:10.150 --> 04:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
engage with so it's not like Union
 
04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
business managers
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
are keeping contractors away from the
 
04:40:18.990 --> 04:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
employees that they employ um already in
 
04:40:21.990 --> 04:40:22.000 align:start position:0%

organization as a condition of securing

or continuing in any employment so this
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%

throughout the country in Canada who
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
work in a number of different industries
 
04:43:32.830 --> 04:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
from steel utilities Health Care law

04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
almost any industry in the Ste or
 
04:43:38.910 --> 04:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
because have people who who work in it
 
04:43:42.430 --> 04:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
um I live in Massachusetts but um
 
04:43:44.550 --> 04:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
probably like many of the state reps
 
04:43:46.948 --> 04:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
attending this hearing today I've spent
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
a big chunk of my career representing
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
good people good working people in the
 
04:43:55.350 --> 04:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I was actually a
 
04:43:58.070 --> 04:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
gas worker for over 30 years in the
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
field um I was a president of a local
 
04:44:03.150 --> 04:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
Amalgamated Union which had members in
 
04:44:05.550 --> 04:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
both New Hampshire and M Massachusetts
 
04:44:07.310 --> 04:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
so I have a lot of friends and I
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
represent a lot of people um who live
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
and work in in the good State of New
 
04:44:15.270 --> 04:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um many of these
 
04:44:18.030 --> 04:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
people cross the Gambit as far as
 
04:44:21.070 --> 04:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
political persuasion um but I can say a
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
majority of them in the state of New
 
04:44:26.910 --> 04:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are registered Republicans um
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you whatever their
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
political affiliation and I continue to
 
04:44:36.190 --> 04:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
talk to the people I've represented um
 
04:44:37.830 --> 04:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
they all say right to work isn't good
 
04:44:39.788 --> 04:44:39.798 align:start position:0%
for them it's not good for them it's not
 
04:44:41.868 --> 04:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
good for their families it's not good
 
04:44:44.430 --> 04:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire um
 
04:44:48.430 --> 04:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
they've said this now 39 times um as
 
04:44:51.910 --> 04:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's been stated previously through the
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
representation um through you through
 
04:44:58.990 --> 04:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
their body um voted down 39
 
04:45:02.830 --> 04:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
times I I've continually asked what's
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
change why this legislation why is it
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
being considered again you look at the
 
04:45:09.590 --> 04:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
other states that have passed right to
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
work I can get you all the data you want
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
anything you want to see it hasn't
 
04:45:16.510 --> 04:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
helped any of the Working Families in
 
04:45:20.270 --> 04:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
those States it hasn't helped the states
 
04:45:23.550 --> 04:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
themselves um it it hasn't helped them
 
04:45:26.830 --> 04:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
financially and it and I can tell you it
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
certainly hasn't helped their reputation
 
04:45:33.628 --> 04:45:33.638 align:start position:0%
a as a state that is concerned about
 
04:45:35.070 --> 04:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
04:45:38.230 --> 04:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
the people who work in those States for
 
04:45:40.670 --> 04:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
the different companies that operate in
 
04:45:46.030 --> 04:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
them um I continually ask people um what
 
04:45:47.948 --> 04:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
they what comes to their mind when when
 
04:45:50.350 --> 04:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
you hear a right to work state well
 
04:45:52.350 --> 04:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
what's the first thing you think of and
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
I get all kinds of different answers and
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
none of them are good uh people
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
say struggling population cheap labor
 
04:46:01.840 --> 04:46:03.190 align:start position:0%
say struggling population cheap labor
exploited

04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
exploited
 
04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce um companies taking advantage
 
04:46:09.390 --> 04:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
of their states and the government um
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
that that's what's on people's minds
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
when they hear the words right to work
 
04:46:15.628 --> 04:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
state and again I can get
 
04:46:19.628 --> 04:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
you any data you think you need because
 
04:46:22.990 --> 04:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
it all supports these opinions as as
 
04:46:26.830 --> 04:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
accurate um I have to ask respectfully
 
04:46:29.470 --> 04:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
um do you want to see the good
 
04:46:33.830 --> 04:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
reputation of this state tarnished um
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
this is how people will see this state
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
moving forward if this legislation
 
04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
passes do you want to know that
 
04:46:45.230 --> 04:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
hardworking New Hampshire people um feel
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
proud to live and work in this state I I
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
think everybody does and I I
 
04:46:53.830 --> 04:46:53.840 align:start position:0%

respectfully um this legislation it's
 
04:47:15.708 --> 04:47:15.718 align:start position:0%
not it's not in the best interests of
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
never mind the state but the country
 
04:47:20.990 --> 04:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's unamerican to force an
 
04:47:24.390 --> 04:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
organization to provide service without
 
04:47:27.310 --> 04:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
payment it's absolutely unamerican and
 
04:47:29.788 --> 04:47:29.798 align:start position:0%
should not be taking place in this good
 
04:47:31.590 --> 04:47:31.600 align:start position:0%

labor committee we can hear you please
 
04:48:30.708 --> 04:48:30.718 align:start position:0%
free to
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
testify good afternoon and thank you for
 
04:48:35.230 --> 04:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
my name is Jim cadillo and I live in
 
04:48:40.110 --> 04:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
Londoner and I oppose this bill it seems
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
the majority of States who have been
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
right to work the longest are failing
 
04:48:45.270 --> 04:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
they have the highest poverty rates in
 
04:48:47.590 --> 04:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
the country and looking at the states
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
that have been right to work the longest
 
04:48:50.948 --> 04:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
made more sense to me than looking at
 
04:48:54.070 --> 04:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
the most recent I live in London Derry I
 
04:48:56.470 --> 04:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
have two kids we love the town and the
 
04:48:59.150 --> 04:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
schools I work in New Hampshire now but
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
there were years that I couldn't I had
 
04:49:03.070 --> 04:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
to work in Massachusetts it's not that I
 
04:49:05.230 --> 04:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
couldn't get a job in New Hampshire I
 
04:49:06.868 --> 04:49:06.878 align:start position:0%
could I just couldn't make the same
 
04:49:09.230 --> 04:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
money and I couldn't get benefits the
 
04:49:11.948 --> 04:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
companies that I did work for in New
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that did offer benefits I was
 
04:49:16.350 --> 04:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
paid too low to actually take advantage
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
of them so I did that commute every day
 
04:49:20.548 --> 04:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
losing hours with my family sitting in
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
traffic and I wasn't alone in 2017 there
 
04:49:25.868 --> 04:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
were over a 100,000 people that made
 
04:49:25.878 --> 04:49:26.990 align:start position:0%
were over a 100,000 people that made
that

04:49:26.990 --> 04:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:49:29.230 --> 04:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
commute Massachusetts isn't right to
 
04:49:31.628 --> 04:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
work it's a very Union Den State and
 
04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
business was booming there enough so
 
04:49:34.830 --> 04:49:34.840 align:start position:0%
that it was is taking care of a large
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
number of families in our state so when
 
04:49:38.510 --> 04:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
people talk about business coming here
 
04:49:40.788 --> 04:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
if we're right to work what kind of
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
business and do we even want them here
 
04:49:43.830 --> 04:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
if they're coming here just to pay low
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
wages and with terrible benefits if any
 
04:49:49.628 --> 04:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
benefits at all um business in mass is
 
04:49:51.070 --> 04:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
there because there was a well-trained
 
04:49:53.070 --> 04:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce and the reason for that is
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
unions spend a lot of money on training
 
04:49:57.310 --> 04:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
their members the people I talked to in
 
04:49:58.708 --> 04:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that are members of a
 
04:50:01.390 --> 04:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
union are proud of it they do better
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
better pay and better benefits I do I
 
04:50:06.430 --> 04:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
joined a union later in life I was by
 
04:50:08.910 --> 04:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
far the oldest Apprentice at that time
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
joining a union in the training that got
 
04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
me changed my life the only regret I
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
have is not joining earlier I own a home
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire now and I work in New
 
04:50:19.948 --> 04:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now and I'll tell you what
 
04:50:21.948 --> 04:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
working both non-union and Union in my
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
life trying to negotiate with a business
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
owner by yourself is can certainly be
 
04:50:28.910 --> 04:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
difficult as a construction worker Union
 
04:50:30.510 --> 04:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
reps listen to their membership about
 
04:50:32.670 --> 04:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
their concerns before they
 
04:50:35.230 --> 04:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
negotiate well let me leave it at this
 
04:50:36.590 --> 04:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
today we have heard from people
 
04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
representing business owners and out of
 
04:50:40.590 --> 04:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
state interest in favor of this bill and
 
04:50:42.430 --> 04:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
all your constituents that you represent
 
04:50:44.670 --> 04:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
seem to be against it so please do the
 
04:50:48.910 --> 04:50:48.920 align:start position:0%

the pandemic when others were told to
 
04:54:44.470 --> 04:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
stay home we were told to show up at

place workers would not be able to stand
 
04:55:05.350 --> 04:55:05.360 align:start position:0%

accidents and death rates on the jobs
 
04:55:26.868 --> 04:55:26.878 align:start position:0%

legislation um today I've heard many
 
04:58:04.470 --> 04:58:04.480 align:start position:0%

04:58:05.948 --> 04:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
fact the entire majority of people
 
04:58:08.310 --> 04:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of this legislation
 
04:58:10.788 --> 04:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
have been uh business
 
04:58:12.868 --> 04:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
organizations uh some from inst State
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
some from out of state uh I have not
 
04:58:17.830 --> 04:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
heard one single person who represents
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
workers speak in favor of this
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
legislation uh everybody knows that this
 
04:58:27.510 --> 04:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
is union busting legislation and that's
 
04:58:30.510 --> 04:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
it it does not bring in quality jobs to
 
04:58:32.510 --> 04:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire it doesn't in
 
04:58:35.548 --> 04:58:35.558 align:start position:0%
the other state that it's been inacted
 
04:58:38.190 --> 04:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire doesn't need meat
 
04:58:41.788 --> 04:58:41.798 align:start position:0%
packing plants or low wage manufacturing
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
jobs New Hampshire needs careers I drive
 
04:58:48.270 --> 04:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
to work every morning down Route three
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
or Route 93 and across 128 into
 
04:58:53.788 --> 04:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I see a veritable
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
who's who of the Fortune 500 the NASDAQ
 
04:59:00.628 --> 04:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
the S&amp;P all those companies are in
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which some of you folks
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
and Conquer tell us is over taxed and
 
04:59:08.030 --> 04:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
over regulated yet all these businesses
 
04:59:11.470 --> 04:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
go there my question to you folks is why
 
04:59:13.390 --> 04:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
would you pass a piece of regressive
 
04:59:15.548 --> 04:59:15.558 align:start position:0%
legislation that's going to make working
 
04:59:18.030 --> 04:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
conditions in New Hampshire even worse
 
04:59:20.110 --> 04:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
you folks should be spending your time
 
04:59:22.830 --> 04:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out why those companies
 
04:59:24.390 --> 04:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
do not come to the state of New
 
04:59:27.270 --> 04:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we supposedly have the New
 
04:59:29.948 --> 04:59:29.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage we continually top
 
04:59:32.150 --> 04:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
out polls for quality of life and best
 
04:59:33.628 --> 04:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
places to live
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
yet all these businesses locate a mere
 
04:59:39.750 --> 04:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
50 mes south of us and as the gentleman
 
04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
stated earlier you've got a 100,000
 
04:59:44.070 --> 04:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
people who get up every single morning
 
04:59:47.150 --> 04:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
and drive into Massachusetts which is
 
04:59:49.948 --> 04:59:49.958 align:start position:0%
the total antithesis of a right to work
 
04:59:54.350 --> 04:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
state so you gentlemen and ladies uh in
 
04:59:56.230 --> 04:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
the legislature have some things you
 
04:59:57.948 --> 04:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
need to figure out and figure out why
 
04:59:59.628 --> 04:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
these companies don't locate in New
 
05:00:03.270 --> 05:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have an educated Workforce
 
05:00:05.350 --> 05:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
which is actually shrinking because our
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
young people are leaving the state in
 
05:00:09.190 --> 05:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
search of higher wages and better
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
benefits the cost of living in New
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is outstripping the wages in
 
05:00:16.548 --> 05:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so we're going to continue
 
05:00:19.548 --> 05:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
to you lose our smartest and youngest
 
05:00:21.548 --> 05:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
people to other
 
05:00:25.310 --> 05:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
states I graduated high school in 1985
 
05:00:27.390 --> 05:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
and more than half of my graduating
 
05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
class lives outside the state of New
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and several of them I have
 
05:00:34.470 --> 05:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
spoken to and they mentioned one thing
 
05:00:36.310 --> 05:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
the money's better elsewhere and the
 
05:00:38.750 --> 05:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
benefits are better elsewhere this
 
05:00:41.708 --> 05:00:41.718 align:start position:0%
legislation is not going to make job
 
05:00:43.548 --> 05:00:43.558 align:start position:0%
conditions in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
any better than they already are it's
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
going to make it worse thank you for
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%

05:00:55.150 --> 05:00:55.160 align:start position:0%

Rochester I don't see either
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:11.070 --> 05:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
hello hello yes we hear you you are free
 
05:02:13.510 --> 05:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
to testify okay thank you Mr chairman
 
05:02:15.708 --> 05:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
05:02:19.350 --> 05:02:19.360 align:start position:0%
Scott calberg and I am opposed to S
 
05:02:21.430 --> 05:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
sp61 I think that the right to work
 
05:02:24.150 --> 05:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
movement is misleading it says that in
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
states that support Right to Work
 
05:02:28.390 --> 05:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
employees have more spendable after tax
 
05:02:30.670 --> 05:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
money and I have a hard time believing
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
that 23 years ago was working for a
 
05:02:36.030 --> 05:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
non-union company on a bridge project
 
05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
and had the opportunity to join the
 
05:02:40.510 --> 05:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
operating engineers which I did I went
 
05:02:43.230 --> 05:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
from making 12250 an hour with terrible
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
Insurance to making $21 an hour in
 
05:02:45.520 --> 05:02:46.510 align:start position:0%
Insurance to making $21 an hour in
excellent

05:02:46.510 --> 05:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
05:02:49.150 --> 05:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
Insurance within a short time I was able
 
05:02:51.548 --> 05:02:51.558 align:start position:0%
to buy my first house and at the same
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
time I watched my friends at the
 
05:02:54.990 --> 05:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
non-union company I had worked with
 
05:02:57.868 --> 05:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
continue to struggle just as I had we
 
05:02:59.868 --> 05:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
all had small families to support and
 
05:03:02.948 --> 05:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
over time they had some success at the
 
05:03:05.548 --> 05:03:05.558 align:start position:0%
jobs all of them got raises and did a
 
05:03:07.868 --> 05:03:07.878 align:start position:0%
little better some better than others
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
and some not as much I on the other hand
 
05:03:12.390 --> 05:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
had benefited from a collective
 
05:03:14.830 --> 05:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement where we received
 
05:03:16.590 --> 05:03:16.600 align:start position:0%
what amounts to a regular cost of living
 
05:03:18.830 --> 05:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
wage in decent working
 
05:03:21.150 --> 05:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
conditions in short I was doing much
 
05:03:23.590 --> 05:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
better than they than my
 
05:03:26.470 --> 05:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
friends what I had that they didn't was
 
05:03:28.910 --> 05:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
someone who interceded on my behalf that
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
was Adept at negotiating I likened it to
 
05:03:33.510 --> 05:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
buying a car if you can negotiate well
 
05:03:35.510 --> 05:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
you do better for yourself and if you
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
aren't a good negotiator you do poorly
 
05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
most people aren't Adept at negotiating
 
05:03:43.030 --> 05:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
so there are varied results I have a
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
friend that owns a landscape business in
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and he say says he pays up
 
05:03:50.910 --> 05:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
to a $10 an hour difference for the same
 
05:03:53.150 --> 05:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
position for employees because of this
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
practice this shows what happens when
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
you make your own
 
05:04:01.190 --> 05:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
deal I was once told by Mr Ed Fish who
 
05:04:03.190 --> 05:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
was the owner of suff construction which
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
is a nationwide building contractor that
 
05:04:08.510 --> 05:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
a true deal is when he pays more than he
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
wanted and the subcontractor didn't get
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
all that he wanted he followed that up
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
with saying the deals are really evenly
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
worked out Mr Fish was a billionaire an
 
05:04:21.110 --> 05:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
expert negotiator that worked with
 
05:04:23.430 --> 05:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
unions and non-union companies
 
05:04:25.948 --> 05:04:25.958 align:start position:0%
alike I believe it believe that if you
 
05:04:27.708 --> 05:04:27.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to be part of a union you
 
05:04:30.548 --> 05:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
don't have to so don't seek a job that
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
is Union if you do want to a job that is
 
05:04:35.510 --> 05:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
Union has a union connected to it you
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
should take that into
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
account asking why the job has the pay
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
the conditions and the benefits that you
 
05:04:44.548 --> 05:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
are seeking it didn't get to be a
 
05:04:46.270 --> 05:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
sought-after position because everyone
 
05:04:48.830 --> 05:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
fought for themselves it was the union
 
05:04:51.390 --> 05:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
behind it that made it appealing to you
 
05:04:53.548 --> 05:04:53.558 align:start position:0%
and you should support that if you don't
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
like unions seek out a non-union
 
05:04:58.510 --> 05:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
position and apply for that right to
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
work vilifies unions but the leadership
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
in a union isn't about being in charge
 
05:05:07.190 --> 05:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
it's about taking care of those in your
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
charge right to work claims a monetary
 
05:05:12.270 --> 05:05:12.280 align:start position:0%

listening to all the other people who uh
 
05:06:02.000 --> 05:06:02.948 align:start position:0%
listening to all the other people who uh
test

test
 
05:06:07.030 --> 05:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
ified that uh the right to work lobbyist
 
05:06:11.190 --> 05:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
was saying that they are protecting what
 
05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be a a very small minority of
 
05:06:17.230 --> 05:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
people who don't want to pay these union
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
dues or fees and um which amounts to a
 
05:06:23.868 --> 05:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
couple hundred dollars as they claim uh
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
for each of these people so why are they
 
05:06:30.470 --> 05:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
spending millions of dollars to save me
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
$200 uh just seems like there's a little
 
05:06:38.270 --> 05:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.430 --> 05:06:41.440 align:start position:0%

what happened um well not everybody had
 
05:07:40.910 --> 05:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
the same uh position I did
 
05:07:45.788 --> 05:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
uh I I was I was doing a a typical um
 
05:07:47.670 --> 05:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know one day I was a carer one day I
 
05:07:51.430 --> 05:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
was the equipment operator I I my whole
 
05:07:53.708 --> 05:07:53.718 align:start position:0%
uh history is as an equipment operator
 
05:07:56.350 --> 05:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
so not everybody had the same
 
05:07:59.750 --> 05:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications uh but uh a few years
 
05:08:02.830 --> 05:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
later there was a a job
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
uh that was actually on the other side
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the bridge and uh two or three of the
 
05:08:11.390 --> 05:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
um of my friends actually went to
 
05:08:14.110 --> 05:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
different unions uh for the same reason
 
05:08:16.310 --> 05:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
I went to the to my
 
05:08:21.030 --> 05:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%

three or four years uh when they were
 
05:08:47.910 --> 05:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
there they didn't have that opportunity
 
05:08:50.430 --> 05:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh when they did go to uh the pile
 
05:08:52.948 --> 05:08:52.958 align:start position:0%

anyone on the committee have to make
 
05:10:48.750 --> 05:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
that life-changing phone
 
05:10:51.310 --> 05:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
call we've seen the studies in states
 
05:10:53.430 --> 05:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
where right to work law
 
05:10:55.948 --> 05:10:55.958 align:start position:0%
exists these states have a
 
05:10:59.548 --> 05:10:59.558 align:start position:0%
54% higher rate of job site
 
05:11:01.590 --> 05:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
fatalities and that's according to the
 
05:11:01.600 --> 05:11:02.948 align:start position:0%
fatalities and that's according to the
BL

05:11:02.948 --> 05:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
BL
 
05:11:06.788 --> 05:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
L I just want to say that again right to
 
05:11:09.510 --> 05:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
work where right to work laws exists
 
05:11:11.548 --> 05:11:11.558 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
05:11:15.310 --> 05:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
54% higher rate of job site
 
05:11:18.350 --> 05:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
fatalities as far as I'm concerned one
 
05:11:20.470 --> 05:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
fatality is too
 
05:11:23.390 --> 05:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
many so what's behind this increase in
 
05:11:23.400 --> 05:11:25.310 align:start position:0%
many so what's behind this increase in
workplace

05:11:25.310 --> 05:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
workplace
 
05:11:27.948 --> 05:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
fatalities as the economic policy
 
05:11:30.830 --> 05:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
Institute notes right to work laws are
 
05:11:34.030 --> 05:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
designed to hurt Union I and lower
 
05:11:37.948 --> 05:11:37.958 align:start position:0%
wages unions give workers a voice in the
 
05:11:40.390 --> 05:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
workplace allowing them to speak up
 
05:11:45.948 --> 05:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
about hazards on the job without fear of
 
05:11:48.830 --> 05:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
retaliation when right to work laws
 
05:11:52.350 --> 05:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
weaken this system of checks and
 
05:11:55.110 --> 05:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
balances workers May no May no longer
 
05:11:59.830 --> 05:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable about speaking up about
 
05:12:02.670 --> 05:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
safety the capy Union is focused on
 
05:12:05.110 --> 05:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
workplace safety and
 
05:12:07.590 --> 05:12:07.600 align:start position:0%

5% that Union
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%

earlier in the day um from Senator Regan
 
05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of them was when when he first

when he first introduced his bill in the
 
05:16:24.110 --> 05:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
Senate his words were exactly you will
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
not hear from any New Hampshire
 
05:16:27.470 --> 05:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
businesses supporting this bill you will
 
05:16:29.868 --> 05:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
not hear from any New Hampshire citizens
 
05:16:31.868 --> 05:16:31.878 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and that that Rings
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
true today I don't hear any New
 
05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%

put people in office who are rep who are
 
05:16:40.628 --> 05:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
asking you boy could you please fix all
 
05:16:42.510 --> 05:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
these wrongs here in New Hampshire with
 
05:16:44.628 --> 05:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
the working system I can't wait to go to
 
05:16:48.230 --> 05:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
Louisiana or Mississippi or or Arkansas
 
05:16:49.548 --> 05:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
because they're right to workstat and
 
05:16:50.788 --> 05:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
they've got such great wages and
 
05:16:52.948 --> 05:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
benefits of course their wages have come
 
05:16:55.150 --> 05:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
up they're at the bottom of the barrel
 
05:16:56.750 --> 05:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing broken here in New
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there is nothing wrong what's
 
05:16:59.948 --> 05:16:59.958 align:start position:0%

05:17:07.788 --> 05:17:07.798 align:start position:0%
even exist so I I truly believe that
 
05:17:10.310 --> 05:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's from out of state influences who
 
05:17:12.070 --> 05:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
gave tens of thousands of dollars
 
05:17:13.990 --> 05:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
reportedly to some New Hampshire
 
05:17:17.390 --> 05:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
Senators as reported by the union leader
 
05:17:19.868 --> 05:17:19.878 align:start position:0%
uh Senator Regan this morning also said
 
05:17:21.990 --> 05:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know he and I quote him again dues
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to pay politicians it's against
 
05:17:27.150 --> 05:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
the law for dues to pay politicians it's
 
05:17:29.310 --> 05:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
against the law we have political action
 
05:17:31.110 --> 05:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
funds which people have spoken about
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
today not dues please re researchers
 
05:17:36.670 --> 05:17:36.680 align:start position:0%
only a couple more points because
 
05:17:38.510 --> 05:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
everything else has been covered we have
 
05:17:40.350 --> 05:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
to represent people whether they pay
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
dues or not go to the National Labor
 
05:17:45.390 --> 05:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
Relations Board website Google failure
 
05:17:48.110 --> 05:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
to represent and see what that says we
 
05:17:51.030 --> 05:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
have to by law represent people the nlrb
 
05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
will have a charge filed with them for
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
failure to represent so we have to take
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
care of everybody whether they pay dues
 
05:18:00.150 --> 05:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
or not we here at the local have both
 
05:18:02.430 --> 05:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
public sector and private sector people
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
so we know both sides of the Janice
 
05:18:05.990 --> 05:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
issue we also know both sides of right
 
05:18:08.708 --> 05:18:08.718 align:start position:0%
to work when the last election came
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
through we realized this bill was going
 
05:18:12.310 --> 05:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
to come up again like it does every two
 
05:18:14.670 --> 05:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
years to fix a problem that does not
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
exist the problem in the state of New
 
05:18:19.270 --> 05:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the high cost of electrical
 
05:18:21.350 --> 05:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
and the high cost of doing business here
 
05:18:23.190 --> 05:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's got nothing to do with whether
 
05:18:25.510 --> 05:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're right to work or not our employers
 
05:18:27.190 --> 05:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
can't find members now can't find
 
05:18:31.628 --> 05:18:31.638 align:start position:0%
employee as it employees as it is so I
 
05:18:34.470 --> 05:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
won't uh continue on but again I just
 
05:18:36.990 --> 05:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate if it's not broke what
 
05:18:39.030 --> 05:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
are we trying to fix the right to work
 
05:18:41.070 --> 05:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
states consistently come out at the
 
05:18:43.470 --> 05:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
bottom of the barrel why would we ever
 
05:18:46.110 --> 05:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
want to be anything like that so with
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
that I'd be glad to answer any questions
 
05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%

05:19:30.110 --> 05:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
Lynch Mike Lynch from Londonberry Mr
 
05:19:32.628 --> 05:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
chairman can you hear me
 
05:19:34.670 --> 05:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
again real quick for you Mr chairman I
 
05:19:36.750 --> 05:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to clear up uh safety things that
 
05:19:38.310 --> 05:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
have been brought up uh before I read my
 
05:19:40.990 --> 05:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
statement being a part of an organized
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh labor force it actually gives for my
 
05:19:45.310 --> 05:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
company gives us a seat at the table um
 
05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to safety we have safety
 
05:19:49.548 --> 05:19:49.558 align:start position:0%
committees uh not all companies are
 
05:19:50.990 --> 05:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
required to have these safety committees
 
05:19:53.510 --> 05:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
where the employees are involved uh our
 
05:19:55.628 --> 05:19:55.638 align:start position:0%
company it's actually negoti you within
 
05:19:57.628 --> 05:19:57.638 align:start position:0%
our CBA that we are required to be at
 
05:19:59.788 --> 05:19:59.798 align:start position:0%
the table with our company uh and it's
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:06.708 --> 05:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
um you please mute me thank you I
 
05:20:08.670 --> 05:20:08.680 align:start position:0%
apologize for that Mike Mr Lynch there
 
05:20:10.750 --> 05:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
was a someone else talking go ahead you
 
05:20:13.788 --> 05:20:13.798 align:start position:0%
can resume uh no worries um I was just
 
05:20:15.670 --> 05:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
stating that basically when it comes to
 
05:20:16.990 --> 05:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
safety because you had asked multiple
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
times that uh this organized Labor uh
 
05:20:22.190 --> 05:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
gives us a seat at the table especially
 
05:20:24.430 --> 05:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
within my company uh gives us a seat
 
05:20:28.270 --> 05:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
where we can uh fight for better PPE and
 
05:20:31.110 --> 05:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
fight for better safety uh whereas if we
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
we were not a organized Union that might
 
05:20:35.510 --> 05:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
not be the case so I just wanted to
 
05:20:38.230 --> 05:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
quickly start off with that for you um
 
05:20:40.070 --> 05:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
but ladies and gentlemen the committee
 
05:20:41.628 --> 05:20:41.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
05:20:42.990 --> 05:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
to testify before you today in
 
05:20:45.670 --> 05:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
opposition as s sp61 not only am I a
 
05:20:48.548 --> 05:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
Union steward within usw local
 
05:20:50.910 --> 05:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
12203 I'm a born and Brad New Hampshire
 
05:20:53.110 --> 05:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
citizen that people who know me would
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
agree when it comes to things political
 
05:20:56.390 --> 05:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
I try to steer as far as away as
 
05:20:59.590 --> 05:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
possible s sp61 is a topic unfortunately
 
05:21:01.350 --> 05:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
I couldn not ignore as it has the
 
05:21:03.110 --> 05:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
potential to directly impact the way I
 
05:21:05.230 --> 05:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
provide for my family I grew up in a
 
05:21:08.110 --> 05:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
union household my mother was a a US
 
05:21:10.150 --> 05:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
postal worker for 30 years my father a
 
05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
union electrical engineer coming from a
 
05:21:14.750 --> 05:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
union household As I Grew Older I was
 
05:21:16.390 --> 05:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
anything but a full-blown Union
 
05:21:19.030 --> 05:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
supporter I would jab at my dad about
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
the typical Union stereotype how many
 
05:21:22.548 --> 05:21:22.558 align:start position:0%
Union guys does it take to change one
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
light bulb de this didn't change until I
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
starting my first job after
 
05:21:29.948 --> 05:21:29.958 align:start position:0%
college this job was for a top financial
 
05:21:31.548 --> 05:21:31.558 align:start position:0%
company based in New Hampshire for an
 
05:21:33.628 --> 05:21:33.638 align:start position:0%
entry-level wage that even after seven
 
05:21:36.270 --> 05:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
years with top end of the year reviews I
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
barely received $10,000 in salary
 
05:21:40.990 --> 05:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
increases I decid at that point to make
 
05:21:43.270 --> 05:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
a change that to this day was the best
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
decision I ever made for myself and my
 
05:21:47.230 --> 05:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
family I accepted a job at Liberty
 
05:21:49.548 --> 05:21:49.558 align:start position:0%
Utilities who I would like to add is on
 
05:21:52.110 --> 05:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
record in opposition of this bill seven
 
05:21:54.708 --> 05:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
years ago they explained to me up front
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
that i' be joining the US Steel Workers
 
05:21:58.390 --> 05:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
Union and they explained what exactly
 
05:22:00.670 --> 05:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
came along with working for that Union
 
05:22:03.190 --> 05:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
our being a part of that Union I saw the
 
05:22:04.830 --> 05:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
instant benefits the union would provide
 
05:22:07.230 --> 05:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
me thanks to the years of negotiations
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
and sacrifices of my previous brothers
 
05:22:11.390 --> 05:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
and sisters I've been able to buy a home
 
05:22:13.310 --> 05:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
in the town I grew up in which in this
 
05:22:15.510 --> 05:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
current housing market I would never be
 
05:22:17.788 --> 05:22:17.798 align:start position:0%
able to afford with my previous
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
job thanks to the union my wage is more
 
05:22:22.788 --> 05:22:22.798 align:start position:0%
than doubled my health care costs aren't
 
05:22:24.990 --> 05:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
crippling and on my current path I'll be
 
05:22:26.270 --> 05:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
able to retire
 
05:22:28.548 --> 05:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
comfortably I've I've also seen our
 
05:22:30.150 --> 05:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
Union save the jobs of many of my
 
05:22:32.430 --> 05:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters sisters whereas if
 
05:22:33.788 --> 05:22:33.798 align:start position:0%
they had worked without union
 
05:22:36.868 --> 05:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
representative representation they most
 
05:22:38.270 --> 05:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
likely would have been terminated
 
05:22:39.830 --> 05:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
instead theyve been given opportunities
 
05:22:43.670 --> 05:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
to prove themselves in closing the state
 
05:22:45.510 --> 05:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Prides itself on not
 
05:22:48.510 --> 05:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
being like most other states it's why
 
05:22:50.750 --> 05:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
unlike the state to our direct s our
 
05:22:52.150 --> 05:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
Senators and representatives don't
 
05:22:54.070 --> 05:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
receive tens of thousands of dollars as
 
05:22:56.110 --> 05:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
salaries to represent the great people
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
of our state although the senator who Co
 
05:23:01.350 --> 05:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored the bill thinks we may cry
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
babies and doesn't know doesn't think we
 
05:23:05.430 --> 05:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
know what's good for us you have a
 
05:23:06.868 --> 05:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
chance to show that we are above these
 
05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
types of people and these Outsiders
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
these Outsiders that have now come 30
 
05:23:13.070 --> 05:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
plus times trying to bring this bill to
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
our state that definitely does not
 
05:23:16.708 --> 05:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
benefit the working citizens yet only
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
seeks to slowly bust unions from the
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
inside out I implore you to ask yourself
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
this one question who do you claim to
 
05:23:26.190 --> 05:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
represent the interests of hardworking
 
05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
men and women of New Hampshire that
 
05:23:29.990 --> 05:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
vastly oppose this bill or the outside
 
05:23:32.190 --> 05:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
interest and big corporations that say
 
05:23:33.948 --> 05:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
they won't come here unless we become a

the first
 
05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
time um my name is Sarah Jane canoy I'm
 
05:24:24.390 --> 05:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
testifying today as a private citizen I
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
am a resident of Manchester I've lived
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for 14 years I'm very
 
05:24:31.440 --> 05:24:32.750 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for 14 years I'm very
against

05:24:32.750 --> 05:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
sb61 and my reasons are based in my
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
personal experience um for about 10
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
years when I was between high school and
 
05:24:44.190 --> 05:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
college and just out of college I worked
 
05:24:46.750 --> 05:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
in several different nursing homes uh
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
taking care of elderly people the first
 
05:24:51.868 --> 05:24:51.878 align:start position:0%
two nursing homes I worked in were not
 
05:24:55.510 --> 05:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
unionized the first one was an
 
05:24:58.030 --> 05:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
absolute disaster the kind of place
 
05:25:00.390 --> 05:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
you'd rather die than have your loved
 
05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
parents or grandparent live in the
 
05:25:05.670 --> 05:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
second one was a little bit better but
 
05:25:07.948 --> 05:25:07.958 align:start position:0%
constantly struggled with problems of
 
05:25:10.990 --> 05:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
lack of sufficient staff overwork of the
 
05:25:13.708 --> 05:25:13.718 align:start position:0%
staff resulting in injuries of the staff
 
05:25:16.230 --> 05:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
because it can be very hard on your back
 
05:25:18.350 --> 05:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
to be uh helping people picking them up
 
05:25:21.030 --> 05:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
and moving them around the third nursing
 
05:25:23.590 --> 05:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
home that I worked at was unionized and
 
05:25:25.470 --> 05:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
the difference between the unionized and
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
the non-unionized nursing home was
 
05:25:31.310 --> 05:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
nursing homes was unbelievable not only
 
05:25:34.590 --> 05:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
were the workers treated better and the
 
05:25:37.910 --> 05:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
workers schedules um more appropriate
 
05:25:41.310 --> 05:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
for care the care for the residents was
 
05:25:43.470 --> 05:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
night and day so much better at the
 
05:25:45.708 --> 05:25:45.718 align:start position:0%
unionized nursing home it was better
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
care because the workers made a decent
 
05:25:49.948 --> 05:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
wage and didn't have to work two or
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
three jobs to support their families it
 
05:25:53.708 --> 05:25:53.718 align:start position:0%
was better care because there were
 
05:25:56.910 --> 05:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
always sufficient numbers of staff that
 
05:25:58.990 --> 05:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
were working each shift and if someone
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
called in sick there was always someone
 
05:26:03.948 --> 05:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
who came in to um fill in for that so we
 
05:26:07.110 --> 05:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
were never short staffed um and this
 
05:26:09.548 --> 05:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
nursing home won national awards because
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
the care that we provided there was so
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
good and we were all proud of our work
 
05:26:15.150 --> 05:26:15.160 align:start position:0%
and proud to be a part of the
 
05:26:17.510 --> 05:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
team after I'd been working there for a
 
05:26:19.948 --> 05:26:19.958 align:start position:0%
few years well actually a few months I
 
05:26:21.868 --> 05:26:21.878 align:start position:0%
realized that the difference was in
 
05:26:25.430 --> 05:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
large part due to the union so later I
 
05:26:27.788 --> 05:26:27.798 align:start position:0%
joined the union committee and got
 
05:26:31.150 --> 05:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
active in the Union as a volunteer um
 
05:26:33.310 --> 05:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
did some meetings and actually helped to
 
05:26:38.070 --> 05:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
negotiate a contract uh for the union so
 
05:26:40.470 --> 05:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
for this reason I'm completely against
 
05:26:42.150 --> 05:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
the so-called
 
05:26:46.350 --> 05:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
misnamed uh Right to Work bill as a
 
05:26:49.548 --> 05:26:49.558 align:start position:0%
person who volunteered to devote time to
 
05:26:52.548 --> 05:26:52.558 align:start position:0%
my union to make sure that my fellow
 
05:26:55.270 --> 05:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
workers had better working conditions it
 
05:26:58.030 --> 05:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
would have been completely unfair to the
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
Union to my work to my volunteers
 
05:27:04.190 --> 05:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
to allow people to benefit from that
 
05:27:06.948 --> 05:27:06.958 align:start position:0%
work without having to pay their fair
 
05:27:09.190 --> 05:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
share I know you've heard from many
 
05:27:11.990 --> 05:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
speakers today about how this is not a
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire-based idea it's an idea
 
05:27:16.788 --> 05:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
that's coming from a think tank outside
 
05:27:18.670 --> 05:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
the state it's an idea that's been
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
defeated many times and I encourage you
 
05:27:23.830 --> 05:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
to please defeat this very
 
05:27:26.990 --> 05:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
ill-considered idea again thank you for
 
05:27:29.070 --> 05:27:29.080 align:start position:0%

20,000 plus union workers in the granite
 
05:28:36.430 --> 05:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
state I'm a republican I grew up in a
 
05:28:38.830 --> 05:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
union household I'm the oldest of the
 
05:28:42.230 --> 05:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
five Murphy kids and when I was 14 my
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
37-year-old father underwent one of the
 
05:28:46.750 --> 05:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
first heart transplants in
 
05:28:48.910 --> 05:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts unfortunately he passed
 
05:28:51.390 --> 05:28:51.400 align:start position:0%
away a month later the surgery was
 
05:28:53.430 --> 05:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
considered experimental at the time and
 
05:28:55.830 --> 05:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
insurance didn't cover much of it his
 
05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
Union ibw 2222 in Boston held
 
05:29:01.750 --> 05:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
fundraisers for him and later for us to
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
help with expenses at his funeral there
 
05:29:06.110 --> 05:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
was a procession of telephone Vehicles
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
all around the cemetery and the line at
 
05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
his wake was out the door of dar's
 
05:29:13.350 --> 05:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
funeral home and around the block I will
 
05:29:16.190 --> 05:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
never forget it when I started with the
 
05:29:18.230 --> 05:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
company myself and began attending Union
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
meetings my dad's former co-workers
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
would love to tell me about how smart he
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
was and what a great technician he was
 
05:29:26.030 --> 05:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
and I love to hear them because I felt
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
like I got to know him as an adult
 
05:29:30.628 --> 05:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
through their stories I I know you're
 
05:29:32.350 --> 05:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
thinking cool story Peg what's your
 
05:29:35.750 --> 05:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
point my point is this our Union is more
 
05:29:38.270 --> 05:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
than our job and our paycheck it's our
 
05:29:40.708 --> 05:29:40.718 align:start position:0%
family my story is real and it's
 
05:29:43.708 --> 05:29:43.718 align:start position:0%
emotional but what it is not is rare
 
05:29:46.270 --> 05:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
union membership is often
 
05:29:48.390 --> 05:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
multigenerational we grow up in a union
 
05:29:50.190 --> 05:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
household and then raise our children in
 
05:29:53.548 --> 05:29:53.558 align:start position:0%
one so I hope that helps illustrate why
 
05:29:55.628 --> 05:29:55.638 align:start position:0%
when this issue is pushed time and time
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
again when colorful mailers featuring
 
05:30:00.510 --> 05:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
smiling models who look like they think
 
05:30:02.990 --> 05:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
law is a yoga practice arrive in the
 
05:30:05.510 --> 05:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
mail and when the public talking point
 
05:30:08.270 --> 05:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
is freedom but behind the scenes it's
 
05:30:11.070 --> 05:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
break the back of organized labor when
 
05:30:12.590 --> 05:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
union members are denigrated
 
05:30:14.910 --> 05:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
simultaneously as both Thugs and
 
05:30:17.150 --> 05:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
crybabies it gets our attention and not
 
05:30:19.868 --> 05:30:19.878 align:start position:0%
in a good way this is a highly emotional
 
05:30:22.310 --> 05:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
issue and voting is a highly emotional
 
05:30:24.788 --> 05:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
action it's insulting and infuriating
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
when our elected leaders simply refuse
 
05:30:29.628 --> 05:30:29.638 align:start position:0%
to listen to us they try to tell us we
 
05:30:31.270 --> 05:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't understand understand the issue
 
05:30:33.868 --> 05:30:33.878 align:start position:0%
it's for our own good as though we are
 
05:30:35.270 --> 05:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
instead of essential service
 
05:30:37.430 --> 05:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
professionals And Trades people we're
 
05:30:39.628 --> 05:30:39.638 align:start position:0%
children who need to be protected from
 
05:30:42.430 --> 05:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves I've been in the room I've
 
05:30:45.190 --> 05:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
heard the real story I understand the
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
true intent of this legislation
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
perfectly and so do my 20,000 voting
 
05:30:51.628 --> 05:30:51.638 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters it's disheartening
 
05:30:53.270 --> 05:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
when our Representatives side with out

business owners they submitted it but
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
wanted it on the
 
05:32:44.510 --> 05:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
record um my name is David garzen I live
 
05:32:46.470 --> 05:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
in Raymond New Hampshire I'm writing
 
05:32:48.350 --> 05:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
this testimony on behalf of myself and
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
my wife Nicole Garza since 2015 we have
 
05:32:55.548 --> 05:32:55.558 align:start position:0%
owned and operated Lupe 55 Cantina
 
05:32:58.070 --> 05:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
located at the beach in Hampton we are
 
05:33:01.070 --> 05:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
here today in opposition to s sp61
 
05:33:02.628 --> 05:33:02.638 align:start position:0%
because this bill will
 
05:33:05.910 --> 05:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
negatively affect our business we have
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
done our research in the difference in
 
05:33:10.230 --> 05:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
quality of life between free bargaining
 
05:33:11.830 --> 05:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
Estates and right to work
 
05:33:14.030 --> 05:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
states and we have no idea why the
 
05:33:15.990 --> 05:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislature thinks that this is a good
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
idea for New Hampshire why are we trying
 
05:33:22.230 --> 05:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
to fix a problem that doesn't exist our
 
05:33:24.270 --> 05:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
business is dependent upon people being
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy themselves and that
 
05:33:28.030 --> 05:33:28.040 align:start position:0%
requires disposable
 
05:33:30.430 --> 05:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
income research shows that medium
 
05:33:33.150 --> 05:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
incomes are substantially Less in R tour
 
05:33:35.150 --> 05:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
States and that alone should show the
 
05:33:37.350 --> 05:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
legislature that New Hampshire doesn't
 
05:33:39.750 --> 05:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
need or want this
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation our state funds education
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
through property taxes the room and
 
05:33:47.150 --> 05:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
meals tax are business pays helps fund
 
05:33:50.110 --> 05:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state if incomes go down
 
05:33:52.750 --> 05:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
in the room and Mills Revenue goes down
 
05:33:54.350 --> 05:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
how are we going to keep the quality of
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
life Granite Staters have without
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
raising property taxes to equalize the
 
05:33:58.878 --> 05:34:00.670 align:start position:0%
raising property taxes to equalize the
shortfall

05:34:00.670 --> 05:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
shortfall
 
05:34:02.670 --> 05:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
finally who does right to work really
 
05:34:05.070 --> 05:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
help from everything we've read it
 
05:34:07.628 --> 05:34:07.638 align:start position:0%
really looks like legislation that will
 
05:34:09.830 --> 05:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
only benefit large corporations that
 
05:34:11.708 --> 05:34:11.718 align:start position:0%
don't need the help and hurt small
 
05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
family-owned businesses like ours
 
05:34:16.868 --> 05:34:16.878 align:start position:0%
neither of us are economists but with
 
05:34:19.030 --> 05:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
the few hours we took to do the research
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
we found that this is a horrible piece
 
05:34:23.190 --> 05:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
of legislation that will undoubtedly
 
05:34:25.788 --> 05:34:25.798 align:start position:0%
hurt our business and many other small
 
05:34:28.708 --> 05:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
businesses in this state please do the
 
05:34:32.948 --> 05:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
research and find as b61 itl thank you
 
05:34:36.868 --> 05:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
Garza all right are there any questions
 
05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%

love this state and uh I remind my state
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
reps um whenever I possibly can that I
 
05:35:47.910 --> 05:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
can't thank them enough uh for the job
 
05:35:51.070 --> 05:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
that they do to represent this
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
state um I am not in favor of Right to
 
05:35:56.948 --> 05:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
Work Senate Bill
 
05:36:00.390 --> 05:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
61 and I ask you to
 
05:36:02.830 --> 05:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
consider um what it could do to this
 
05:36:04.990 --> 05:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
state um
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
by I think hurting unions across the
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
state and not just unions but companies
 
05:36:16.510 --> 05:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
in general um I think that is bad for
 
05:36:19.670 --> 05:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
this state uh it has failed several
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
times as you know on moving forward I
 
05:36:25.350 --> 05:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
think that um you as Representatives
 
05:36:27.948 --> 05:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
have a job to do and continue to vote
 
05:36:30.110 --> 05:36:30.120 align:start position:0%

organizations of this type unions are an
 
05:41:02.110 --> 05:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
dispensable element of social life
 
05:41:04.590 --> 05:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
especially in modern industrialized
 
05:41:07.070 --> 05:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
societies he went on to say that modern
 
05:41:09.070 --> 05:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
unions grew up from the struggle of
 
05:41:11.750 --> 05:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
workers to protect their just rights and
 
05:41:13.910 --> 05:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
that thanks to the work of their unions
 
05:41:16.350 --> 05:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
workers will not only have more but
 
05:41:18.948 --> 05:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
above all be more in other words that

05:41:34.150 --> 05:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
Truth concluded the repeated calls
 
05:41:36.390 --> 05:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
within the church's social Doctrine

promotion of workers associations that
 
05:41:43.510 --> 05:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
can defend their rights must be honored
 
05:41:47.270 --> 05:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
today even more than in the past Senate
 
05:41:50.150 --> 05:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 61 does nothing to advance the
 
05:41:53.430 --> 05:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
human dignity of working people or to
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of workers to
 
05:41:58.310 --> 05:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
organize and maintain effective unions
 
05:41:59.750 --> 05:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
it is meant to keep
 
05:42:03.830 --> 05:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
unions weak in and effective all in the
 
05:42:05.990 --> 05:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
nature of some economic benefit that
 
05:42:09.430 --> 05:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
might Ur we know all too well that in
 
05:42:11.868 --> 05:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
the states where it has been adopted
 
05:42:14.948 --> 05:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
this legislation has led to lower wages
 
05:42:17.548 --> 05:42:17.558 align:start position:0%
fewer benefits for working people such
 
05:42:20.430 --> 05:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
as Employer Health Care pensions more
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous workplaces higher infant
 
05:42:26.548 --> 05:42:26.558 align:start position:0%
mortality rates and higher poverty rates
 
05:42:28.868 --> 05:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 61 is called the right to
 
05:42:31.910 --> 05:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
work act but is it is misnamed because
 
05:42:33.750 --> 05:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't create any new rights for
 
05:42:36.830 --> 05:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
working people this law seeks to impede
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
work of solidarity and create divisions
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
in the workplace it sets the economic
 
05:42:45.270 --> 05:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
interests of a single individual against
 
05:42:48.150 --> 05:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
the common good of the group as a whole
 
05:42:51.310 --> 05:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
Cardinal Blas kopich of the ash dases of
 
05:42:54.510 --> 05:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
Chicago observed that history has shown
 
05:42:57.230 --> 05:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
that a society with a healthy effective
 
05:42:59.628 --> 05:42:59.638 align:start position:0%
and responsible labor movement is a
 
05:43:01.990 --> 05:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
better place than one where powerful
 
05:43:04.788 --> 05:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
economic interests have their way and
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
the voices and rights of work is
 
05:43:09.788 --> 05:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
undiminished Senate Bill 61 does nothing
 
05:43:12.468 --> 05:43:12.478 align:start position:0%
to enhance the Dignity of working people
 
05:43:14.868 --> 05:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
and it sole purpose is to weaken unions
 
05:43:17.708 --> 05:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
so necessary to the common good of New

thing for New Hampshire to adopt this
 
05:47:28.990 --> 05:47:29.000 align:start position:0%

allowing me to speak about Senate Bill
 
05:48:17.030 --> 05:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
61 New Hampshire steel has been a very
 
05:48:19.590 --> 05:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
successful construction subcontractor
 
05:48:22.430 --> 05:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
for over 40 years so I would like to
 
05:48:24.270 --> 05:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
address this bill from the perspective
 
05:48:27.150 --> 05:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
of of an employer between the two of
 
05:48:29.468 --> 05:48:29.478 align:start position:0%
them my company's employee over 100
 
05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
people at our facility in gtown and on
 
05:48:35.510 --> 05:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
nearly two dozen active construction job
 
05:48:38.350 --> 05:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
sites around New England proudly
 
05:48:42.270 --> 05:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
including my employees um included among
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
my employees are over 50 Union ion
 
05:48:47.868 --> 05:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
workers out of local 7 very early on in
 
05:48:50.150 --> 05:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
the life of my company back in the 20th
 
05:48:52.708 --> 05:48:52.718 align:start position:0%
century I realized that if my steel
 
05:48:54.948 --> 05:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
fabrication operation was going to be
 
05:48:57.110 --> 05:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
successful grow and continue to thrive
 
05:48:59.468 --> 05:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
into the future I needed to improve the
 
05:49:01.948 --> 05:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
the service end of it because that's
 
05:49:04.750 --> 05:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
what general contractors demanded I knew
 
05:49:06.270 --> 05:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
immediately that I would need the help
 
05:49:08.270 --> 05:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
of iron workers the Iron Workers Union
 
05:49:10.430 --> 05:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
to provide the kind of trained and
 
05:49:12.110 --> 05:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
reliable Workforce that would bring
 
05:49:14.270 --> 05:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
success that's when I established New
 
05:49:15.910 --> 05:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire steel directors as a union
 
05:49:18.628 --> 05:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
Ting company I made that decision freely
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
and of my own accord clearly it was one
 
05:49:23.110 --> 05:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
of the best decisions I ever made for my
 
05:49:25.350 --> 05:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
company and its employees but I want to
 
05:49:27.788 --> 05:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
reiterate the important thing is that I
 
05:49:30.150 --> 05:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
made the decision as my own choice I
 
05:49:32.030 --> 05:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
believe this bill would interfere with
 
05:49:34.430 --> 05:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
my right as an employer or any other
 
05:49:36.990 --> 05:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
employer's rights to choose how to run
 
05:49:40.430 --> 05:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
his or her business and how I negotiate
 
05:49:43.390 --> 05:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
with my Workforce I made my decision
 
05:49:44.948 --> 05:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
based on my knowledge that when I use
 
05:49:47.868 --> 05:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
Union Union iron workers I am putting
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
well-trained safety-minded professionals
 
05:49:52.990 --> 05:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
on my job sites who will do the job well
 
05:49:55.548 --> 05:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
the first time that makes my customers
 
05:49:57.590 --> 05:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
happy allowing me to secure more work
 
05:49:59.350 --> 05:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
and protect my body botom line allowing
 
05:50:01.468 --> 05:50:01.478 align:start position:0%
me to grow the company and hire more
 
05:50:04.110 --> 05:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
people I do not believe allowing
 
05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
government into the middle of my
 
05:50:07.868 --> 05:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
negotiations with workers which is what
 
05:50:10.110 --> 05:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
this bill does will do anything to boost
 
05:50:12.788 --> 05:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
employment or grow the economy right to
 
05:50:14.390 --> 05:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
work will force me to change the way I
 
05:50:16.230 --> 05:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
negotiate with my workers because the
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
government decided it can set terms
 
05:50:21.708 --> 05:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
better than I can for my own projects I
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
know I made the right choice when I
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
chose to work with the Union the proof
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
is in the pudding New Hampshire steel is
 
05:50:28.708 --> 05:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
one of the largest strongest most
 
05:50:30.750 --> 05:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
well-respected miscellaneous metal
 
05:50:33.110 --> 05:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
subcontractors in New England we have
 
05:50:35.030 --> 05:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
seen consistent growth through our
 
05:50:37.510 --> 05:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
Inception since our Inception and have
 
05:50:39.788 --> 05:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
weathered three deep recessions and a
 
05:50:41.910 --> 05:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic thriving when many of our
 
05:50:44.030 --> 05:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
competitors went under I can honestly
 
05:50:46.310 --> 05:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
say that signing a Union contract was a
 
05:50:48.468 --> 05:50:48.478 align:start position:0%
major part of that success if this
 
05:50:50.868 --> 05:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
so-called right to work law had been in
 
05:50:53.030 --> 05:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
effect all this time I cannot say we
 
05:50:55.070 --> 05:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
would have done as well as we have I
 
05:50:57.468 --> 05:50:57.478 align:start position:0%
will let others testify as to how right
 
05:51:00.468 --> 05:51:00.478 align:start position:0%
to work laws depress wages stifle growth
 
05:51:03.628 --> 05:51:03.638 align:start position:0%
and slow Economic Opportunity in closing
 
05:51:05.750 --> 05:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here to say that as an employer I
 
05:51:07.310 --> 05:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
don't want the government getting into
 
05:51:09.468 --> 05:51:09.478 align:start position:0%
my business and in interfering with my
 
05:51:12.468 --> 05:51:12.478 align:start position:0%
ability to hire quality employees that
 
05:51:15.070 --> 05:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
help my business grow that should be my
 
05:51:19.070 --> 05:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
right to be a union operation or not
 
05:51:21.468 --> 05:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
just as it's the op the employees right
 
05:51:24.670 --> 05:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
to work at a union shop or not it's just
 
05:51:26.868 --> 05:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
not fair that an employee for an
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
employee to enjoy the benefit benefits
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
of a negotiated Union contract without
 
05:51:33.390 --> 05:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
paying paying their fair share of what
 
05:51:35.830 --> 05:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
it took to secure those benefits this
 
05:51:37.948 --> 05:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
bill is a bad idea it it's not good
 
05:51:41.030 --> 05:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
policy please reject Senate Bill 61 and
 
05:51:42.910 --> 05:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't interfere with my right to choose
 
05:51:46.510 --> 05:51:46.520 align:start position:0%

05:53:50.548 --> 05:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
ever why I ask would we let a
 
05:53:53.628 --> 05:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
misleadingly named Bill to be passed in
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
our state right to work is wrong for New
 
05:53:57.080 --> 05:53:59.070 align:start position:0%
our state right to work is wrong for New
Hampshire

05:53:59.070 --> 05:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:54:01.708 --> 05:54:01.718 align:start position:0%
ask yourselves where is this push coming
 
05:54:04.310 --> 05:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
from when I was at the farmers market
 
05:54:07.468 --> 05:54:07.478 align:start position:0%
this weekend spending my money in my
 
05:54:10.310 --> 05:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
local businesses do you think I saw
 
05:54:13.230 --> 05:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
anyone from Virginia there I don't think
 
05:54:16.670 --> 05:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
so I see men and women of New Hampshire
 
05:54:19.150 --> 05:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
working men and women spending their
 
05:54:22.390 --> 05:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
money supporting our businesses and
 
05:54:24.548 --> 05:54:24.558 align:start position:0%

second can you hear me
 
05:56:52.430 --> 05:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
now yes we can okay um basically there I
 
05:56:54.190 --> 05:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
asked about 20 Representatives if they
 
05:56:57.430 --> 05:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
were for or against uh the right to work
 
05:56:59.830 --> 05:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
and most of them said they were for it
 
05:57:01.628 --> 05:57:01.638 align:start position:0%
and I said okay what are your reasons
 
05:57:03.468 --> 05:57:03.478 align:start position:0%
and two reasons they basically gave me
 
05:57:07.548 --> 05:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
was being forced to join a union and
 
05:57:10.230 --> 05:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
being forced to pay dues so with that
 
05:57:14.830 --> 05:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
said I give you my history uh back in 84
 
05:57:18.070 --> 05:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
I worked for a heating company and I was
 
05:57:19.990 --> 05:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
making a good wage I thought everything
 
05:57:22.070 --> 05:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
was going good friend of mine hit me up
 
05:57:24.948 --> 05:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
and said hey Union's looking for a guy
 
05:57:27.110 --> 05:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
would you like to come over so I checked
 
05:57:29.510 --> 05:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
out and said where you offered basically
 
05:57:31.430 --> 05:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell my wages were going to go
 
05:57:35.548 --> 05:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
from $7 an hour back at 84 to 12 my
 
05:57:37.628 --> 05:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
insurance for health was going to go to
 
05:57:40.788 --> 05:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
something called a JY plan which was the
 
05:57:43.230 --> 05:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
Cadillac of everything back then I was
 
05:57:46.708 --> 05:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
going to get uh a dental plan I was
 
05:57:49.230 --> 05:57:49.240 align:start position:0%
going to get a pension I was going to
 
05:57:52.590 --> 05:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
get a couple of extra paid holidays five
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
sick days in an extra week after 10
 
05:57:58.190 --> 05:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
years it was like it was an no-brainer
 
05:57:59.708 --> 05:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
it was only going to cost me about one
 
05:58:03.510 --> 05:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
and a half% in Union dues so just to
 
05:58:05.310 --> 05:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
raise a loan was going to cover that so
 
05:58:08.350 --> 05:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
I jumped nobody forced me and I went in
 
05:58:11.190 --> 05:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
there with both eyes wide open I am a
 
05:58:13.030 --> 05:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
registered Republican have been for
 
05:58:14.708 --> 05:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
years I didn't know there so many of us
 
05:58:17.548 --> 05:58:17.558 align:start position:0%
out there also been a union officer and
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
a union employee for about 36
 
05:58:24.150 --> 05:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
years the other thing is dues okay
 
05:58:25.750 --> 05:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
everybody talks about having to pay the
 
05:58:28.270 --> 05:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
dues not having to pay the dues
 
05:58:30.670 --> 05:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
there are many places Boy Scouts Girl
 
05:58:33.510 --> 05:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
Scouts Kanas clubs the Nights of
 
05:58:37.548 --> 05:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
Columbus hobby clubs uh sporting clubs
 
05:58:40.190 --> 05:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
and country clubs they all Childs does
 
05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
is to run the organization or to do
 
05:58:45.190 --> 05:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
charitable events imagine walking up
 
05:58:46.910 --> 05:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
into the Manchester Country Club after
 
05:58:48.788 --> 05:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
so many years and say hey I don't feel
 
05:58:51.750 --> 05:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
like paying du anymore I'm done and I
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
still join and enjoy the the amenities
 
05:58:55.990 --> 05:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
that go with it I don't think you'll
 
05:58:58.190 --> 05:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
stay there that long
 
05:59:01.548 --> 05:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
another thing about this thing is safety
 
05:59:03.510 --> 05:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
I go to a lot of construction sites over
 
05:59:06.590 --> 05:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
the years one construction side I won't
 
05:59:08.750 --> 05:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
mention in town in Manchester that it
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
happened they had spotters and what
 
05:59:13.270 --> 05:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
these guys did was they kept an eye out
 
05:59:16.150 --> 05:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
for the oosha guys and the safety guys
 
05:59:18.150 --> 05:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
while they put a guy down in the trench
 
05:59:21.030 --> 05:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
about 15 feet below the surface to take
 
05:59:23.670 --> 05:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
measurements Etc and when somebody came
 
05:59:26.150 --> 05:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
up they yelled Don get out of the hole
 
05:59:27.788 --> 05:59:27.798 align:start position:0%
because they didn't want to put Shoring
 
05:59:31.110 --> 05:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
up Etc so I find that Union shops are
 
05:59:35.230 --> 05:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
far safer than non-union shops not all
 
05:59:38.030 --> 05:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
but the ones I see pick right
 
05:59:41.190 --> 05:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
out and the other thing is I look at
 
05:59:43.868 --> 05:59:43.878 align:start position:0%
people and I they talk about unions
 
05:59:46.590 --> 05:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
donating money to one party or another
 
05:59:48.030 --> 05:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
you got to ask yourself would you rather
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
have $200 in a donation or 200 votes I
 
05:59:53.670 --> 05:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
didn't realize how many Republicans were
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
Union supporters at the same time I
 
05:59:58.990 --> 05:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was just a a few of us but it
 
06:00:02.548 --> 06:00:02.558 align:start position:0%
seems to be quite a bit in closing the
 
06:00:05.070 --> 06:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
devil's in the details the simple Right
 
06:00:06.670 --> 06:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
to Work bill would be a couple of
 
06:00:08.230 --> 06:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
sentences here it is this is what you
 
06:00:09.628 --> 06:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
have this is what we want this is what
 
06:00:12.910 --> 06:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
you do it isn't until a bill has passed
 
06:00:15.430 --> 06:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's been in the process for a while
 
06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
that you realize the other ramifications
 
06:00:21.070 --> 06:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
along with it and this is what I worry
 
06:00:24.390 --> 06:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
about is down the road what happens you
 
06:00:26.070 --> 06:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
watch a restaurant show they do
 
06:00:27.628 --> 06:00:27.638 align:start position:0%
something they change the restaurant
 
06:00:29.628 --> 06:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
around they go back a year later they
 
06:00:32.750 --> 06:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
look at it okay and they see you know if
 
06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
the guy followed it if things are going
 
06:00:36.750 --> 06:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
good and if it doesn't when we pass
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
bills throughout the country the town
 
06:00:40.948 --> 06:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
everything else nobody really looks at
 
06:00:44.230 --> 06:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
what the ramifications are of that bill
 
06:00:45.868 --> 06:00:45.878 align:start position:0%
years down the road you get bits and
 
06:00:47.990 --> 06:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
pieces of it but it's like anything else
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
there's thousands of laws and bills out
 
06:00:53.750 --> 06:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
there and they all go away you know so
 
06:00:55.830 --> 06:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
with this thing here it seems like
 
06:00:57.830 --> 06:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
nobody wants it that wants to you it's a
 
06:01:00.468 --> 06:01:00.478 align:start position:0%
good worker nobody's forced to join a
 
06:01:03.510 --> 06:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
union my Union's only seen two guys
 
06:01:06.868 --> 06:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
leave over the course of the 35 years
 
06:01:08.830 --> 06:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
and they both for personal reasons you
 
06:01:10.990 --> 06:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
know they basically moved out of state
 
06:01:14.670 --> 06:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
so everybody stays so going forward I'm
 
06:01:16.628 --> 06:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
against the bill and I hope the rest of
 
06:01:18.910 --> 06:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
you are you know take a long hard look
 
06:01:21.468 --> 06:01:21.478 align:start position:0%
at the people out here that do work it's
 
06:01:23.830 --> 06:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
not going to do any benefit to anybody
 
06:01:26.150 --> 06:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time I appreciate
 
06:01:28.948 --> 06:01:28.958 align:start position:0%

our group of
 
06:04:02.590 --> 06:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
workers could have decided to be an open
 
06:04:05.190 --> 06:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
shop where the workers can choose not to
 
06:04:07.948 --> 06:04:07.958 align:start position:0%
join a union and not be covered under
 
06:04:10.270 --> 06:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
any collective bargaining agreement our
 
06:04:12.190 --> 06:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
group of workers decided that having a
 
06:04:14.350 --> 06:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
union shop and working under the same
 
06:04:16.628 --> 06:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
collectively BG and agreement is what
 
06:04:19.910 --> 06:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
works best for us and our families our
 
06:04:23.628 --> 06:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
workers as a group have decided that for
 
06:04:26.230 --> 06:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
our local to have the most leverage to
 
06:04:28.468 --> 06:04:28.478 align:start position:0%
collectively bargain everybody should be
 
06:04:30.350 --> 06:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
part of the group and all operate under
 
06:04:32.310 --> 06:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
the same agreement that's what we came
 
06:04:33.590 --> 06:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
up with and we
 
06:04:36.030 --> 06:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
decided as a group and that's what our
 
06:04:39.110 --> 06:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
companies agree to state of thean should
 
06:04:41.070 --> 06:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
not be getting involved in an agreement
 
06:04:42.910 --> 06:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
between a group of workers and the
 
06:04:44.948 --> 06:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
companies that they collectively bargain
 
06:04:48.430 --> 06:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
with this right to work law would
 
06:04:50.150 --> 06:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
effectively make those collectively
 
06:04:53.350 --> 06:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
bargain agreements n in void just a few
 
06:04:55.230 --> 06:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
of the questions that will come up is
 
06:04:56.788 --> 06:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
what will happen to those negotiated
 
06:04:59.110 --> 06:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
contra contct s how is this new law
 
06:05:01.510 --> 06:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
going to be enforced who is going to
 
06:05:03.030 --> 06:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
enforce this new
 
06:05:06.868 --> 06:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
law are the taxpayers of enhance you
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay the fees associated
 
06:05:10.590 --> 06:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
with the compliance of this totally
 
06:05:13.708 --> 06:05:13.718 align:start position:0%
unnecessary law the law that this body
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
is entertaining will let a worker that
 
06:05:18.628 --> 06:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
is covered under our agreement refuse to
 
06:05:21.230 --> 06:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
contribute his or her fair share of dues
 
06:05:23.190 --> 06:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
that are agreed upon by the workers in
 
06:05:25.590 --> 06:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
the company that said worker would still
 
06:05:27.030 --> 06:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
be covered under the same contract
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
contract as all the other workers has
 
06:05:31.390 --> 06:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
anyone on this committee actually had a
 
06:05:33.390 --> 06:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
constituent come up to them and say you
 
06:05:35.230 --> 06:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
know what I don't think I want to pay my
 
06:05:37.548 --> 06:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
dues but I want to keep my good pay and
 
06:05:40.190 --> 06:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
all the benefits I also want the union
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
to bargain for me and represent me if
 
06:05:44.070 --> 06:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
need be but I don't want to contribute
 
06:05:47.150 --> 06:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
my fair share like everybody else does
 
06:05:49.910 --> 06:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
why would this bill even be entertained
 
06:05:51.628 --> 06:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
that would be like entertaining A bill
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
that gives employees the right to refuse
 
06:05:56.070 --> 06:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
to pay health insurance premiums but
 
06:05:58.590 --> 06:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
still be covered under the said policy
 
06:05:59.948 --> 06:05:59.958 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire would certainly
 
06:06:01.948 --> 06:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
not entertain a bill like
 
06:06:04.590 --> 06:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
that I hear the argument that a member
 
06:06:06.910 --> 06:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to contribute if he or
 
06:06:08.868 --> 06:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
she doesn't like the union
 
06:06:12.070 --> 06:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
leadership the truth is your local union
 
06:06:14.150 --> 06:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
leaderships made up of the co-workers
 
06:06:16.948 --> 06:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
within your group our locals have a
 
06:06:19.510 --> 06:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
simple Democratic solution to a poor
 
06:06:22.350 --> 06:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
leadership issue you vote them out or
 
06:06:24.390 --> 06:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
better yet you run for the leadership
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
position yourself if you feel that you
 
06:06:28.548 --> 06:06:28.558 align:start position:0%
can do a better job you don't take your
 
06:06:30.948 --> 06:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
ball and go home I.E I'm not paying my
 
06:06:34.110 --> 06:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
fair share your union belongs to you and
 
06:06:36.788 --> 06:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
your co-workers if there are issues
 
06:06:39.270 --> 06:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
which there are in every local you work
 
06:06:42.070 --> 06:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
them out the Democratic way you come up
 
06:06:44.430 --> 06:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
with a compromise on the issues within
 
06:06:47.788 --> 06:06:47.798 align:start position:0%
your group and or you put them to a vote
 
06:06:49.628 --> 06:06:49.638 align:start position:0%
as I stated earlier your group can
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
decide not to be a union shop
 
06:06:54.830 --> 06:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
not your group can decide to be an open
 
06:06:56.350 --> 06:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
shot where joining the union is
 
06:06:56.360 --> 06:06:57.708 align:start position:0%
shot where joining the union is
voluntary

06:06:57.708 --> 06:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
voluntary
 
06:06:59.948 --> 06:06:59.958 align:start position:0%
your group can decide to unite as one
 
06:07:02.628 --> 06:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
voice and be a union shop that decision
 
06:07:04.948 --> 06:07:04.958 align:start position:0%
should be totally up to the employees
 
06:07:07.708 --> 06:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
and the employer again the state of New
 
06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the tax Bayes of New
 
06:07:11.628 --> 06:07:11.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should not get involved in the
 
06:07:14.150 --> 06:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
everyday Mutual decisions between a
 
06:07:16.150 --> 06:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
private group of workers and a private
 
06:07:18.350 --> 06:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
corporation that is simply not part of
 
06:07:20.310 --> 06:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire's modotto Live Free or
 
06:07:23.628 --> 06:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
Die Another argument I hear is a new
 
06:07:25.468 --> 06:07:25.478 align:start position:0%
worker should not have to join a union
 
06:07:27.390 --> 06:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
company if they don't want to well they
 
06:07:30.030 --> 06:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
don't the truth is there are many more
 
06:07:31.590 --> 06:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities out there to work for a
 
06:07:33.590 --> 06:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
non-un company than there are for Union
 
06:07:36.150 --> 06:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
companies 90% of workers in New
 
06:07:38.270 --> 06:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do not belong to a union as we
 
06:07:41.230 --> 06:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
speak again 90% of workers in New
 
06:07:43.590 --> 06:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do not currently belong to a
 
06:07:46.350 --> 06:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
union so to say that a new worker does
 
06:07:48.468 --> 06:07:48.478 align:start position:0%
not have the choice to work a job that
 
06:07:51.468 --> 06:07:51.478 align:start position:0%
is non-un is very misleading in all
 
06:07:53.910 --> 06:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
outfalls I know in my industry alone
 
06:07:55.910 --> 06:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
there are numerous utility companies out
 
06:07:57.948 --> 06:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
there that are not affiliated with any
 
06:08:00.310 --> 06:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
unions and they do the exact same work
 
06:08:02.110 --> 06:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
as my utility company
 
06:08:05.510 --> 06:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
does most of these union jobs pay less
 
06:08:07.350 --> 06:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
in the union jobs but they're still good
 
06:08:09.628 --> 06:08:09.638 align:start position:0%
paying jobs because they have to compete
 
06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
with the Union companies to attract good
 
06:08:13.948 --> 06:08:13.958 align:start position:0%
workers doesn't take a rocket scientist
 
06:08:16.270 --> 06:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
to figure out that passing right to work
 
06:08:18.750 --> 06:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
will eventually lower the wages of union
 
06:08:21.390 --> 06:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
workers which in turn will lower the pay
 
06:08:24.310 --> 06:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
of all New Hampshire workers right to
 
06:08:25.788 --> 06:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
work laws are
 
06:08:29.150 --> 06:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
anti Union laws so as they weaken New
 
06:08:31.430 --> 06:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unions they will also weaken
 
06:08:33.430 --> 06:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
all the New Hampshire workers because
 
06:08:35.030 --> 06:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
non-union companies will not have to
 
06:08:37.708 --> 06:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
compete with union wages and benefits
 
06:08:39.868 --> 06:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
anymore weakening unions in New
 
06:08:41.590 --> 06:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will also make it harder for
 
06:08:43.070 --> 06:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire companies to keep the
 
06:08:45.548 --> 06:08:45.558 align:start position:0%
skilled workers in our state because the
 
06:08:47.190 --> 06:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
skilled worker would just drive the 20
 
06:08:49.390 --> 06:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
miles down to Massachusetts to seek
 
06:08:51.830 --> 06:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
employment massachusett attracts
 
06:08:54.270 --> 06:08:54.280 align:start position:0%
companies from all over the world partly
 
06:08:55.948 --> 06:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
because the competitive wages and the
 
06:08:58.150 --> 06:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
benefits set by strong unions they
 
06:08:59.830 --> 06:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
attract the skilled workers to fill
 
06:09:01.830 --> 06:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
those positions that are desperately
 
06:09:04.510 --> 06:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
needed by these companies right to work
 
06:09:05.750 --> 06:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
will do nothing for New Hampshire
 
06:09:07.948 --> 06:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
workers but send our skilled Workforce
 
06:09:10.910 --> 06:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
Force elsewhere to search for good jobs
 
06:09:12.750 --> 06:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
there are many other forms of legisl
 
06:09:14.430 --> 06:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
that can be passed to help the workers
 
06:09:15.788 --> 06:09:15.798 align:start position:0%
of the hampsh if that's what we want to
 
06:09:18.510 --> 06:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
do here the almost criminal
 
06:09:21.350 --> 06:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
$725 minimum wage can be increase for
 
06:09:25.590 --> 06:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
instance employee at will um laws the
 
06:09:27.788 --> 06:09:27.798 align:start position:0%
paid medical leave laws law could be
 
06:09:29.670 --> 06:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
more worker friendly these are some of
 
06:09:30.990 --> 06:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
the issues that we we should be
 
06:09:33.788 --> 06:09:33.798 align:start position:0%
discussing not not anti-worker union
 
06:09:37.190 --> 06:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
busting bills I also want to take to
 
06:09:40.150 --> 06:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
touch on another argument that union
 
06:09:42.670 --> 06:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
dues are to support politicians I used
 
06:09:44.910 --> 06:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
to support politicians that is not true
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
set the record straight federal law
 
06:09:49.788 --> 06:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
restricts any using any Union from using
 
06:09:52.030 --> 06:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
their union dues to engage in political
 
06:09:54.788 --> 06:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
lobbying activities all pack
 
06:09:57.510 --> 06:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
contributions are voluntary and do not
 
06:09:59.830 --> 06:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
come out of union dues in order for a
 
06:10:02.190 --> 06:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
union member to contribute to a pack
 
06:10:04.030 --> 06:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
they need to voluntarily contribute from
 
06:10:06.830 --> 06:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
their own personal bank account use of
 
06:10:09.430 --> 06:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
local union dues for any reason or any
 
06:10:11.230 --> 06:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
type of endorsement for a political
 
06:10:13.990 --> 06:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
candidate are discussed and debated by
 
06:10:16.430 --> 06:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
the union body and then they go through
 
06:10:19.110 --> 06:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
a motion procedure at a monthly union
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
meeting it has to be passed by the
 
06:10:23.708 --> 06:10:23.718 align:start position:0%
members having said that it certainly
 
06:10:25.750 --> 06:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
makes no sense for any Union member to
 
06:10:28.230 --> 06:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
endorse a politic ician that supports
 
06:10:30.750 --> 06:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
right to work laws or any other
 
06:10:35.270 --> 06:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
anti-worker law and lastly for those of
 
06:10:37.110 --> 06:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
you that argue Right to Work do not
 
06:10:39.910 --> 06:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
weaken a union are just playing
 
06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
wrong sometimes it takes a little time
 
06:10:44.468 --> 06:10:44.478 align:start position:0%
to infect the body so it doesn't happen
 
06:10:47.430 --> 06:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
overnight but none of us should be naive
 
06:10:49.350 --> 06:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
enough to to think that there aren't
 
06:10:51.788 --> 06:10:51.798 align:start position:0%
some companies out there that would love
 
06:10:54.548 --> 06:10:54.558 align:start position:0%
to exploit this union busting bill for
 
06:10:57.910 --> 06:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
example your union could be very small
 
06:11:00.270 --> 06:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
you could have a group of say 10 workers
 
06:11:02.030 --> 06:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
and I want to stress that point you
 
06:11:03.670 --> 06:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
don't need hundreds of thousands of
 
06:11:06.150 --> 06:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
workers to form a union you don't have
 
06:11:10.190 --> 06:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
to be in part of an international to be
 
06:11:12.590 --> 06:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
a union a union could be five workers
 
06:11:15.070 --> 06:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
could be two workers could be three
 
06:11:19.990 --> 06:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
workers so those 10 workers can agree to
 
06:11:22.230 --> 06:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
contribute Union duels and secure funds
 
06:11:24.390 --> 06:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
for a number of different reasons
 
06:11:26.788 --> 06:11:26.798 align:start position:0%
whether it be simple expenses like being
 
06:11:29.230 --> 06:11:29.240 align:start position:0%
able to donate to a local charity
 
06:11:32.150 --> 06:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
purchase t-shirts Union buttons um get
 
06:11:34.628 --> 06:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
in the local Fourth of July parade they
 
06:11:36.430 --> 06:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
could use those funds to set up training
 
06:11:39.350 --> 06:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
facilities or safety classes or it can
 
06:11:41.270 --> 06:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
be more serious issues like having to
 
06:11:43.070 --> 06:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
hire a labor lawyer to representing
 
06:11:44.948 --> 06:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
member in arbitration against the
 
06:11:47.350 --> 06:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
company if a company decides that it
 
06:11:49.990 --> 06:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't want David could you please wrap
 
06:11:53.510 --> 06:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
up your Tes y f up if a company decides
 
06:11:55.750 --> 06:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't want to play fair anymore and
 
06:11:57.670 --> 06:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
sees that TR those funds will weaken the
 
06:11:59.750 --> 06:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of those workers it can
 
06:12:01.830 --> 06:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
simply St to hire workers that they know
 
06:12:04.468 --> 06:12:04.478 align:start position:0%
will not pay Union duals whether it be a
 
06:12:06.868 --> 06:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
CEO's brother or cousin or what have you
 
06:12:08.590 --> 06:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
if they can hire employees that they
 
06:12:10.628 --> 06:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
know will abuse this right to work law
 
06:12:12.310 --> 06:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
they will eventually weaken the Union's
 
06:12:14.110 --> 06:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
Kitty to a point where it becomes
 
06:12:17.190 --> 06:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
ineffective that union busting 101 this
 
06:12:19.230 --> 06:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
example of union busting is hypothetical
 
06:12:20.788 --> 06:12:20.798 align:start position:0%
but it could easily take place and most
 
06:12:22.590 --> 06:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
certainly probably has in right to work
 
06:12:24.788 --> 06:12:24.798 align:start position:0%
states here in New Hampshire what is not
 
06:12:26.150 --> 06:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
hypothetical is the fact that right to
 
06:12:28.430 --> 06:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
work already has weakened our unions in
 
06:12:30.830 --> 06:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
this state without s sp61 even being
 
06:12:32.948 --> 06:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
passed yet I say that because there's
 
06:12:35.110 --> 06:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
all there's usually hundreds of
 
06:12:38.430 --> 06:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of more union
 
06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
workers voicing their opinion on this
 
06:12:43.350 --> 06:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
but Janice took them already out of it
 
06:12:45.750 --> 06:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters police teachers and public
 
06:12:47.430 --> 06:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
union members have been taken out of the
 
06:12:49.910 --> 06:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
mix by Janice decision so saying that
 
06:12:51.830 --> 06:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
these laws have not affected unions
 
06:12:54.468 --> 06:12:54.478 align:start position:0%
already is not true and this and if this
 
06:12:56.430 --> 06:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
body passes right to work in the private
 
06:12:58.350 --> 06:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
SEC you silence the voice of the rest of
 
06:13:00.150 --> 06:13:00.160 align:start position:0%

we do it's all about the workers in our
 
06:14:41.110 --> 06:14:41.120 align:start position:0%

note that there are six people in the uh
 
06:15:42.788 --> 06:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
uh participant box with their hands up
 
06:15:44.230 --> 06:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if they're on your list or
 
06:15:46.590 --> 06:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
not but I uh understand that some of
 
06:15:48.510 --> 06:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
them have been texting committee members
 
06:15:49.788 --> 06:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
trying to get our
 
06:15:51.548 --> 06:15:51.558 align:start position:0%
attention you know I don't know what to
 
06:15:53.548 --> 06:15:53.558 align:start position:0%
do representative Sullivan we had 85
 
06:15:55.030 --> 06:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
people sign up the last time I let

someone who called in they hadn't even
 
06:15:57.990 --> 06:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
been they were on the list I hadn't
 
06:15:59.548 --> 06:15:59.558 align:start position:0%
called them yet I feel that if I'm
 
06:16:02.948 --> 06:16:02.958 align:start position:0%
letting people call in first they're
 
06:16:04.830 --> 06:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
going ahead of the people that signed up
 
06:16:06.708 --> 06:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to do the signups first
 
06:16:09.750 --> 06:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
and every single person who calls in
 
06:16:12.110 --> 06:16:12.120 align:start position:0%

encouragement of my employer I res I
 
06:17:51.070 --> 06:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
urge your rejection of
 
06:17:55.510 --> 06:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
sb61 in our 104 years of existence as an
 
06:17:59.110 --> 06:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
organiz ation afsc has been joining
 
06:18:02.628 --> 06:18:02.638 align:start position:0%
workers in their fight for safety for
 
06:18:05.230 --> 06:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
dignity uh and for an opportunity to
 
06:18:08.670 --> 06:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
thrive starting back in 1922 when we
 
06:18:11.150 --> 06:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
were providing assistance to unemployed
 
06:18:14.708 --> 06:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
coal miners in West Virginia and
 
06:18:18.150 --> 06:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania in 1936 after President
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt signed the National Labor
 
06:18:23.990 --> 06:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
Relations Act afsc issued a statement
 
06:18:26.510 --> 06:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
that included this statement
 
06:18:28.390 --> 06:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining by groups of
 
06:18:31.868 --> 06:18:31.878 align:start position:0%
workers with employers is desirable in
 
06:18:34.390 --> 06:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
order that workers may meet Management
 
06:18:37.430 --> 06:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
on something like equal terms when they
 
06:18:40.430 --> 06:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
bargain for rates of pay conditions of
 
06:18:44.230 --> 06:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
work and security of employment and
 
06:18:46.070 --> 06:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
since then throughout the country and
 
06:18:48.230 --> 06:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
actually throughout the world we have
 
06:18:50.468 --> 06:18:50.478 align:start position:0%
stood with people who are seeking
 
06:18:53.468 --> 06:18:53.478 align:start position:0%
employment living wages and dignity on
 
06:18:53.478 --> 06:18:54.310 align:start position:0%
employment living wages and dignity on
the

06:18:54.310 --> 06:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:18:57.190 --> 06:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
job and within New Hampshire the ability
 
06:18:59.390 --> 06:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
of working people to attain a decent
 
06:19:03.390 --> 06:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
standard of living is under threat
 
06:19:05.468 --> 06:19:05.478 align:start position:0%
according to the New Hampshire Housing
 
06:19:08.590 --> 06:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority the Statewide median
 
06:19:10.628 --> 06:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
rent of a two-bedroom apartment in New
 
06:19:13.350 --> 06:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was
 
06:19:16.750 --> 06:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
$1,413 a month in 2020 which was a
 
06:19:19.708 --> 06:19:19.718 align:start position:0%
nearly 5% increase from the previous
 
06:19:22.510 --> 06:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
year so that means it takes an income of
 
06:19:23.468 --> 06:19:23.478 align:start position:0%
more than
 
06:19:27.150 --> 06:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
$56,500 a year to afford a typical
 
06:19:30.270 --> 06:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
apartment that's 3.8 times what a worker
 
06:19:32.030 --> 06:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
makes at the current federal minimum
 
06:19:35.190 --> 06:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
wage and 1.8 times what a worker earning
 
06:19:38.910 --> 06:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
$15 an hour even would be able to
 
06:19:42.390 --> 06:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
afford if the purpose of s sp61 were to
 
06:19:45.230 --> 06:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
provide jobs at decent wages we would be
 
06:19:48.030 --> 06:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
heartily in favor of it but right to
 
06:19:50.468 --> 06:19:50.478 align:start position:0%
work is not about ensuring that people
 
06:19:52.708 --> 06:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
have the right to a decent job it's
 
06:19:54.830 --> 06:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
about undermining the ability of working
 
06:19:57.390 --> 06:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
people to organize among themselves and
 
06:19:57.400 --> 06:19:58.948 align:start position:0%
people to organize among themselves and
bargain

06:19:58.948 --> 06:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
bargain
 
06:20:01.230 --> 06:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
collectively by making it more difficult
 
06:20:03.390 --> 06:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
for workers to organize Right to Work
 
06:20:05.670 --> 06:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
forces down the wage levels of working
 
06:20:07.990 --> 06:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire and the ability
 
06:20:09.868 --> 06:20:09.878 align:start position:0%
to afford health care would be
 
06:20:12.310 --> 06:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
threatened as well the ability to pay
 
06:20:14.590 --> 06:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
taxes to support schools would be
 
06:20:17.270 --> 06:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
diminished our housing crisis will
 
06:20:20.590 --> 06:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
intensify more people will need public
 
06:20:23.230 --> 06:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
assistance in the written testimony that
 
06:20:25.750 --> 06:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
I'll submit to the committee I cite a
 
06:20:28.390 --> 06:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
report by the economic policy Institute
 
06:20:31.910 --> 06:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
that talks about the impact on low-wage
 
06:20:35.708 --> 06:20:35.718 align:start position:0%
unun workers during covid-19 who have
 
06:20:37.788 --> 06:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
been at considerable risk without
 
06:20:40.750 --> 06:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
adequate Pro protective gear paid sick
 
06:20:43.910 --> 06:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
leave and no protections for speaking up
 
06:20:46.948 --> 06:20:46.958 align:start position:0%
so this pandemic makes even more clear
 
06:20:50.030 --> 06:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh the benefit that our unions bring to
 
06:20:52.310 --> 06:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
the safety of our workplace so please
 
06:20:54.110 --> 06:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
listen to all of the workers who have
 
06:20:56.708 --> 06:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
spoken up today New Hampshire workers
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
and recommend this bill be inexpedient
 
06:21:01.270 --> 06:21:01.280 align:start position:0%

06:21:42.590 --> 06:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh I know you have heard a lot of
 
06:21:46.030 --> 06:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
testimony today I uh I admire your
 
06:21:47.990 --> 06:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
fortitude I will try to keep my
 
06:21:50.230 --> 06:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
testimony brief and make three
 
06:21:54.270 --> 06:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
points one uh I am opposed to
 
06:21:57.070 --> 06:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
sb61 it is is a remarkable piece of
 
06:21:57.080 --> 06:21:58.070 align:start position:0%
sb61 it is is a remarkable piece of
government

06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:22:01.110 --> 06:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
overreach uh I imagine that most of the
 
06:22:04.390 --> 06:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
people supporting it view themselves as
 
06:22:07.590 --> 06:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
Believers in small government and so I
 
06:22:10.830 --> 06:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
ask if you believe in small government
 
06:22:12.310 --> 06:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
why do you want to stick the
 
06:22:15.788 --> 06:22:15.798 align:start position:0%
government's hand in here I have run my
 
06:22:17.830 --> 06:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
own small business in New Hampshire a
 
06:22:21.390 --> 06:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
law office for the last 40 years I have
 
06:22:23.390 --> 06:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
not needed the assistance of the State
 
06:22:25.750 --> 06:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to tell me whether I
 
06:22:29.350 --> 06:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
can for uh support my employees in
 
06:22:32.628 --> 06:22:32.638 align:start position:0%
forming a union or oppose their forming
 
06:22:36.350 --> 06:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
a union that's between me and them it is
 
06:22:38.590 --> 06:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
not a matter for the state to try to
 
06:22:41.948 --> 06:22:41.958 align:start position:0%
dictate to me how I will deal with my
 
06:22:41.958 --> 06:22:43.628 align:start position:0%
dictate to me how I will deal with my
own

06:22:43.628 --> 06:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
own
 
06:22:45.830 --> 06:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
employees and I believe that any
 
06:22:47.948 --> 06:22:47.958 align:start position:0%
believer in small government would
 
06:22:50.548 --> 06:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
support this position I know that one of
 
06:22:52.628 --> 06:22:52.638 align:start position:0%
the uh representatives of one of the
 
06:22:55.670 --> 06:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
national groups supporting the bill said
 
06:22:58.270 --> 06:22:58.280 align:start position:0%
you well there's already plenty of
 
06:23:00.590 --> 06:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
Regulation from the federal level and
 
06:23:05.350 --> 06:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
other levels well first of all I'm not
 
06:23:08.150 --> 06:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
sure that the Fe the Federal Regulation
 
06:23:10.230 --> 06:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
pushes you one way or the other it just
 
06:23:12.590 --> 06:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
opens things up but beyond that
 
06:23:15.190 --> 06:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
logically even if you think okay there's
 
06:23:19.070 --> 06:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
already a lot of Regulation why put more
 
06:23:24.070 --> 06:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
in why add another layer and constrain
 
06:23:26.990 --> 06:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
someone like myself in how he wants to
 
06:23:29.990 --> 06:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
deal with his
 
06:23:35.270 --> 06:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
employees my second point is
 
06:23:37.948 --> 06:23:37.958 align:start position:0%
that I've testified against this bill
 
06:23:42.270 --> 06:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
before uh I uh am not a union member but
 
06:23:44.468 --> 06:23:44.478 align:start position:0%
for many years I have been general
 
06:23:46.390 --> 06:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
counsel to the American Federation of
 
06:23:49.030 --> 06:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
teachers but the first time I testified
 
06:23:51.310 --> 06:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
against this bill was probably 25 years
 
06:23:54.350 --> 06:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
ago I was not anything other than a
 
06:23:57.510 --> 06:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
young attorney build up his business and
 
06:23:59.788 --> 06:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
the lady ahead of me who was testifying
 
06:24:01.590 --> 06:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
against the
 
06:24:04.190 --> 06:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill was someone I wanted to thank
 
06:24:06.948 --> 06:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
because she was very honest she said I'm
 
06:24:09.190 --> 06:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
testifying against this bill because I
 
06:24:12.030 --> 06:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
don't like unions and I think this bill
 
06:24:14.270 --> 06:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
will undermine
 
06:24:18.628 --> 06:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
unions and she was absolutely right and
 
06:24:20.708 --> 06:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
forthright that's what this bill is
 
06:24:23.510 --> 06:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
about it is an anti-union
 
06:24:26.030 --> 06:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill you will hear that oh no we are
 
06:24:29.468 --> 06:24:29.478 align:start position:0%
just trying to protect each individual
 
06:24:33.548 --> 06:24:33.558 align:start position:0%
worker I ask you logically do you
 
06:24:37.150 --> 06:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
seriously think that the people
 
06:24:37.160 --> 06:24:38.788 align:start position:0%
seriously think that the people
funding

06:24:38.788 --> 06:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
funding
 
06:24:43.190 --> 06:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
the national Right to Work committee and
 
06:24:47.190 --> 06:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
the other right to work committees or
 
06:24:50.150 --> 06:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
even Americans for Prosperity you think
 
06:24:52.948 --> 06:24:52.958 align:start position:0%
they are interested in in individual
 
06:24:55.990 --> 06:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
workers here in New Hampshire if you
 
06:24:57.350 --> 06:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
believe that if any member of the
 
06:25:00.270 --> 06:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
committee believes that uh I have two
 
06:25:03.110 --> 06:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
lots in Rio Rancho Estates just sou
 
06:25:05.910 --> 06:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
outside of Albuquerque New Mexico I will
 
06:25:07.430 --> 06:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
happily sell
 
06:25:11.468 --> 06:25:11.478 align:start position:0%
you uh so no this is an anti-union bill
 
06:25:12.990 --> 06:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's what it's about it's designed to
 
06:25:16.150 --> 06:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
undermine the unions it's designed to
 
06:25:19.190 --> 06:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
break up the essential solidarity that
 
06:25:21.708 --> 06:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
any Union needs to function
 
06:25:23.948 --> 06:25:23.958 align:start position:0%
effectively it's essentially if you're
 
06:25:25.910 --> 06:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the union if the Union representing
 
06:25:28.030 --> 06:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
your bargaining unit we're all in this
 
06:25:30.310 --> 06:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
together but if you start making those
 
06:25:33.150 --> 06:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
kind of Divisions that this bill would
 
06:25:35.430 --> 06:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
re virtually require
 
06:25:37.948 --> 06:25:37.958 align:start position:0%
then uh you have definitely undermined
 
06:25:39.830 --> 06:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
the union and you've done so through
 
06:25:42.628 --> 06:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
government action which is exactly what
 
06:25:44.788 --> 06:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
Believers in small government should not
 
06:25:49.868 --> 06:25:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:54.628 --> 06:25:54.638 align:start position:0%
uh it just in terms of unions themselves
 
06:25:57.548 --> 06:25:57.558 align:start position:0%
you know if if there's no
 
06:26:00.948 --> 06:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
Union the boss is one of the world's
 
06:26:03.948 --> 06:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
last absolute monarchs I practice in a
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
small town
 
06:26:07.830 --> 06:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
Farmington and I've had people over the
 
06:26:10.548 --> 06:26:10.558 align:start position:0%
last 40 years come into me and say I was
 
06:26:12.548 --> 06:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
just fired from my job and it was most
 
06:26:15.070 --> 06:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
unfair and they described the situation
 
06:26:18.948 --> 06:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
to me and I listened to them and at the
 
06:26:22.468 --> 06:26:22.478 align:start position:0%
end of the conversation I say I hear you
 
06:26:24.868 --> 06:26:24.878 align:start position:0%
it was unfair it was unreasonable and it
 
06:26:26.350 --> 06:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
was even even foolish on the part of
 
06:26:28.990 --> 06:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
your boss do you have a
 
06:26:31.910 --> 06:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
union and they say no and I say I'm
 
06:26:34.708 --> 06:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
sorry there's nothing I can do because
 
06:26:38.070 --> 06:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
your boss can walk into the office can
 
06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
walk onto the shop floor and if there's
 
06:26:43.030 --> 06:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
no union he can say it's Tuesday and I
 
06:26:44.708 --> 06:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
want to fire
 
06:26:48.468 --> 06:26:48.478 align:start position:0%
you so that's one of the reasons I think
 
06:26:50.830 --> 06:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
unions are a good thing in addition to
 
06:26:52.708 --> 06:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
all the other things you've heard
 
06:26:57.468 --> 06:26:57.478 align:start position:0%
today and this bill is designed its sole
 
06:27:00.830 --> 06:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
purpose in life is to undercut unions to
 
06:27:03.150 --> 06:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
make that breach in the Dyke that may
 
06:27:05.548 --> 06:27:05.558 align:start position:0%
lead to further things it is an
 
06:27:08.150 --> 06:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
unwarranted government intrusion into
 
06:27:09.990 --> 06:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
the relationship between employers and
 
06:27:13.708 --> 06:27:13.718 align:start position:0%
employees and I ask you to vote that it
 
06:27:16.110 --> 06:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
is inexpedient to legislate thank you
 
06:27:18.750 --> 06:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
very much thank you for your testimony
 
06:27:20.830 --> 06:27:20.840 align:start position:0%

Hampshire I strongly request you all
 
06:29:07.468 --> 06:29:07.478 align:start position:0%
oppose this rather ingeniously named
 
06:29:09.110 --> 06:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
legislation called right to work Senate
 
06:29:11.750 --> 06:29:11.760 align:start position:0%

work states New Hampshire does not need
 
06:29:26.510 --> 06:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
to be included uded in those
 
06:29:28.510 --> 06:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
statistics the number of union members
 
06:29:31.628 --> 06:29:31.638 align:start position:0%
in the Hampshire is 10.3% only 69,000
 
06:29:33.190 --> 06:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
according to us Bureau of Labor
 
06:29:34.830 --> 06:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
Statistics which some of them are
 
06:29:36.910 --> 06:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
members of the pan and Airi trades and
 
06:29:38.468 --> 06:29:38.478 align:start position:0%
many are registered
 
06:29:40.868 --> 06:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
Republicans I am asked directly by them
 
06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
why are New Hampshire legislators
 
06:29:43.788 --> 06:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
attacking workers right to bargain here
 
06:29:45.750 --> 06:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where we already have
 
06:29:47.468 --> 06:29:47.478 align:start position:0%
such an increasingly low opportunity to
 
06:29:49.350 --> 06:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
work in the construction field for a
 
06:29:51.030 --> 06:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
fair living wage which include Health
 
06:29:53.190 --> 06:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
and Welfare benefits we are led to
 
06:29:54.590 --> 06:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
believe out State influence from the
 
06:29:56.788 --> 06:29:56.798 align:start position:0%
national Right to Work committee located
 
06:29:59.070 --> 06:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
in Springfield Virginia in their very
 
06:30:02.350 --> 06:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
generous $100,000 contribution to 10 C
 
06:30:04.150 --> 06:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
and state senators is a reason for this
 
06:30:06.510 --> 06:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
legislation as a voter I hope not
 
06:30:10.310 --> 06:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
because dollars don't vote constituents
 
06:30:12.708 --> 06:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
do government interference between
 
06:30:14.548 --> 06:30:14.558 align:start position:0%
employers and employees are not
 
06:30:17.350 --> 06:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
conservative values imposing burdens to
 
06:30:20.430 --> 06:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
employers on jobsite postings fines and
 
06:30:22.708 --> 06:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
imprisonment language legislators
 
06:30:24.990 --> 06:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
seeking to imprison employers but wish
 
06:30:26.750 --> 06:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
to make their own business decisions and
 
06:30:28.910 --> 06:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
divide workers in the Hampshire are not
 
06:30:30.430 --> 06:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
properly representing their business
 
06:30:32.150 --> 06:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
owners or
 
06:30:35.030 --> 06:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
constituents sb61 is misleading has
 
06:30:37.230 --> 06:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with freedom or protecting
 
06:30:39.430 --> 06:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
us from paying dues if that was true
 
06:30:41.190 --> 06:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
then why would we Overlook dues assess
 
06:30:42.670 --> 06:30:42.680 align:start position:0%
to be a member of the Chamber of
 
06:30:45.310 --> 06:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
Commerce which have six levels of dues
 
06:30:48.388 --> 06:30:48.398 align:start position:0%
starting at 575 to two
 
06:30:51.628 --> 06:30:51.638 align:start position:0%
$2,50 annually and why not then include
 
06:30:53.350 --> 06:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
the bu association fee golf cost
 
06:30:55.230 --> 06:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
membership the list goes on but makes no
 
06:30:57.430 --> 06:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
sense to go after any of them including
 
06:31:00.750 --> 06:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
the unions my union located in brenwood

I think about I so many numbers but one
 
06:34:27.548 --> 06:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
of the numbers I keep in the back of my
 
06:34:28.990 --> 06:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
head all the time is the number of
 
06:34:31.150 --> 06:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
people that work for me who bought
 
06:34:34.230 --> 06:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
houses uh in in a time when you know
 
06:34:36.030 --> 06:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
we've we've spoken over the last decade
 
06:34:37.430 --> 06:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
about how many people have been unable
 
06:34:41.030 --> 06:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
to do that um how many of the men and
 
06:34:43.788 --> 06:34:43.798 align:start position:0%
women that work for me have seen their
 
06:34:48.430 --> 06:34:48.440 align:start position:0%

06:35:00.230 --> 06:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
lives through this this Union process
 
06:35:01.548 --> 06:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
you know and it this collective
 
06:35:04.190 --> 06:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining and this ability to uh

negotiate and I'm and I'm on I'm still a
 
06:35:08.310 --> 06:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
card carrying Union member but I'm on
 
06:35:09.990 --> 06:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
the other side of the fence because I am
 
06:35:11.388 --> 06:35:11.398 align:start position:0%
employing these
 
06:35:11.398 --> 06:35:13.430 align:start position:0%

06:35:23.628 --> 06:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
girls uh in Derry and um when my second

daughter was three mon months old she
 
06:35:28.590 --> 06:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
suffered a stroke and uh I there's a lot
 
06:35:31.788 --> 06:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
of ways that that event could have went
 
06:35:33.628 --> 06:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
for our family I'm thankful to say she's
 
06:35:35.548 --> 06:35:35.558 align:start position:0%

years old going on four hopefully going
 
06:35:44.830 --> 06:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
on 100 um but when I think about the
 
06:35:47.150 --> 06:35:47.160 align:start position:0%

06:35:49.310 --> 06:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
my life you know one of the ways
 
06:35:50.628 --> 06:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in this country is
 
06:35:53.030 --> 06:35:53.040 align:start position:0%

06:37:31.788 --> 06:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
Republican Party 22-year member of the
 
06:37:33.350 --> 06:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
International Brotherhood of Electrical
 
06:37:35.708 --> 06:37:35.718 align:start position:0%
Workers and have served four terms in
 
06:37:36.670 --> 06:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire House of
 
06:37:38.468 --> 06:37:38.478 align:start position:0%
Representatives my last term I was on
 
06:37:40.310 --> 06:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
the labor committee so hello to anybody
 
06:37:44.110 --> 06:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
I served with s sp61 like other Right to
 
06:37:46.030 --> 06:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
Work legislation has been a perennial
 
06:37:48.468 --> 06:37:48.478 align:start position:0%
issue in New Hampshire for decades time
 
06:37:49.948 --> 06:37:49.958 align:start position:0%
and again the issue has been brought
 
06:37:52.350 --> 06:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
forward and been rejected and during
 
06:37:53.430 --> 06:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
most of this time there have been
 
06:37:54.750 --> 06:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
Republican government Governors and
 
06:37:56.670 --> 06:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
Republican majorities in the House and
 
06:38:00.030 --> 06:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
Senate as a union member I oppose s sp61
 
06:38:01.388 --> 06:38:01.398 align:start position:0%
because I believe it to be detrimental
 
06:38:03.468 --> 06:38:03.478 align:start position:0%
to organized labor much the same way
 
06:38:04.750 --> 06:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
people in the restaurant industry would
 
06:38:06.590 --> 06:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
reject right to eat legislation that
 
06:38:08.230 --> 06:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
required them to feed people who are not
 
06:38:08.240 --> 06:38:09.190 align:start position:0%
required them to feed people who are not
paying

06:38:09.190 --> 06:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
paying
 
06:38:11.750 --> 06:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
customers as a republican I reject SP
 
06:38:13.868 --> 06:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
sp61 as unwanted legislative
 
06:38:15.590 --> 06:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
intervention in Private
 
06:38:19.030 --> 06:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
Industry the 2018 US Supreme Court Jan's
 
06:38:20.830 --> 06:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
decision has already imposed Right to
 
06:38:22.830 --> 06:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
Work language on public sector unions
 
06:38:25.110 --> 06:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
bills like s sp61 would only be
 
06:38:26.670 --> 06:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
impacting private
 
06:38:28.830 --> 06:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
businesses normally Republicans would
 
06:38:31.230 --> 06:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
say this is literally not our
 
06:38:33.510 --> 06:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
business as a republican I also oppose
 
06:38:35.430 --> 06:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
Right to Work legislation because I
 
06:38:36.948 --> 06:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
believe there is no grounds full of
 
06:38:39.070 --> 06:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
support for it in New Hampshire when the
 
06:38:41.468 --> 06:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
issue was brought forward in 2010 and
 
06:38:43.788 --> 06:38:43.798 align:start position:0%
2016 hundreds of people attended the
 
06:38:46.990 --> 06:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
hearings in vocal opposition with very
 
06:38:50.190 --> 06:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
relatively few people voicing support to
 
06:38:52.430 --> 06:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
our detriment we ignored this leaving
 
06:38:54.430 --> 06:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
the voters their only other option to or
 
06:38:55.948 --> 06:38:55.958 align:start position:0%
displeasure and that was at The Ballot
 
06:38:59.230 --> 06:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
Box in 2012 and 2018 there was a
 
06:39:00.948 --> 06:39:00.958 align:start position:0%
reversal of Fortune for the majority
 
06:39:03.788 --> 06:39:03.798 align:start position:0%
party we need not see a repeat of this
 
06:39:03.798 --> 06:39:05.190 align:start position:0%
party we need not see a repeat of this
in

06:39:05.190 --> 06:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:39:07.350 --> 06:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
2022 at this point I'm going to depart
 
06:39:09.190 --> 06:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
from my prepared statement to address a
 
06:39:10.628 --> 06:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
question that's come up repeatedly
 
06:39:13.708 --> 06:39:13.718 align:start position:0%
during testimony and that is if Right to
 
06:39:15.468 --> 06:39:15.478 align:start position:0%
Work passes would you stop paying union
 
06:39:16.948 --> 06:39:16.958 align:start position:0%
dues or do you believe members of your
 
06:39:19.310 --> 06:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
union would stop paying union dues now
 
06:39:21.468 --> 06:39:21.478 align:start position:0%
consistently the answer has been no now
 
06:39:23.190 --> 06:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is because these
 
06:39:24.830 --> 06:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
people like myself self when they went
 
06:39:27.430 --> 06:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
looking for employment we took jobs
 
06:39:29.230 --> 06:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
because of Union involvement not in
 
06:39:32.548 --> 06:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
spite of them these were our decisions
 
06:39:34.670 --> 06:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
freely chosen that was our freedom we
 
06:39:38.350 --> 06:39:38.360 align:start position:0%
did that our concerns for our Union are
 
06:39:40.468 --> 06:39:40.478 align:start position:0%
with new hires going forward when Right
 
06:39:43.628 --> 06:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
to Work were to pass at this point left
 
06:39:45.910 --> 06:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
people potentially taking jobs that
 
06:39:47.788 --> 06:39:47.798 align:start position:0%
they've all along known about the
 
06:39:49.948 --> 06:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
benefits of being in a union but they
 
06:39:51.310 --> 06:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
never took a union job because they
 
06:39:54.670 --> 06:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
didn't want to pay for the benefits now
 
06:39:56.548 --> 06:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
these people as far as I'm concerned
 
06:39:58.750 --> 06:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
it's not about Freedom it's about free
 
06:40:01.190 --> 06:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
they want something for nothing and over
 
06:40:03.670 --> 06:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
time that will bleed unions I don't
 
06:40:05.430 --> 06:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
think that's an unintended consequence I
 
06:40:06.910 --> 06:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
don't think it's an oversight I think
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's the intention of Right to Work
 
06:40:11.110 --> 06:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
legislation now if what was being
 
06:40:13.270 --> 06:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
discussed here today was absolving
 
06:40:15.628 --> 06:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
people of their obligations to pay condo
 
06:40:17.270 --> 06:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
association fees or homeowners
 
06:40:20.750 --> 06:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
association dues be the same thing we as
 
06:40:22.310 --> 06:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
Republicans always argue against
 
06:40:24.468 --> 06:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
entitlement societies because we say
 
06:40:25.788 --> 06:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
eventually there'll be more people in
 
06:40:28.270 --> 06:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
the cart than pulling then the economy
 
06:40:31.708 --> 06:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
crumbles Society fails same for unions
 
06:40:33.948 --> 06:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
same for condo associations same for
 
06:40:35.788 --> 06:40:35.798 align:start position:0%
anything where people get something
 
06:40:38.388 --> 06:40:38.398 align:start position:0%
without paying for it it will eventually
 
06:40:41.350 --> 06:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
fail now so it's not to go on too long
 
06:40:42.948 --> 06:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure some of you were thinking
 
06:40:45.990 --> 06:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
too late you already have in conclusion
 
06:40:48.590 --> 06:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
if I know that s sp61 faces tremendous
 
06:40:49.990 --> 06:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
opposition from the people that claims
 
06:40:52.190 --> 06:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
to help and if I know the legislative
 
06:40:54.548 --> 06:40:54.558 align:start position:0%
intervention in private business
 
06:40:56.070 --> 06:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
is something that is not favored in New
 
06:40:58.510 --> 06:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and finally if I know that
 
06:41:00.510 --> 06:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
many perennial bills are said to have
 
06:41:02.350 --> 06:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
had their day and right to work had
 
06:41:04.388 --> 06:41:04.398 align:start position:0%
decades and should have been set aside
 
06:41:07.750 --> 06:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
long ago but I now move as61 in
 
06:41:09.670 --> 06:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you for
 
06:41:09.680 --> 06:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you for
your

06:41:11.510 --> 06:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:41:13.708 --> 06:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
time thank you very
 
06:41:16.548 --> 06:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
much honorable Michael McCarthy for your
 
06:41:19.948 --> 06:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions
 
06:41:23.430 --> 06:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
online see none we have one in L
 
06:41:23.440 --> 06:41:25.310 align:start position:0%
online see none we have one in L
represent

06:41:25.310 --> 06:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:41:30.430 --> 06:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh still
 
06:41:36.310 --> 06:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:39.350 --> 06:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
McCarthy uh yes I'm here thank you you
 
06:41:42.548 --> 06:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
disappeared for a second um I'm a
 
06:41:44.310 --> 06:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
Democrat probably going to disagree on
 
06:41:47.628 --> 06:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
most stuff um but I appreciate your
 
06:41:51.750 --> 06:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
testimony today um we've heard from some
 
06:41:55.150 --> 06:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
folks today who like yourself are into
 
06:41:56.910 --> 06:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
right to work that one of the common
 
06:41:59.190 --> 06:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
criticisms that they hear of unions is
 
06:42:02.388 --> 06:42:02.398 align:start position:0%
that they overwhelmingly Z Democrats um
 
06:42:05.190 --> 06:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
politically and we heard testimony today
 
06:42:08.230 --> 06:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's gone against that but in that
 
06:42:12.628 --> 06:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
hypothetical um do you think that
 
06:42:15.670 --> 06:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
elected Republican officials might enjoy
 
06:42:18.190 --> 06:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
more support from Rank and final union
 
06:42:21.430 --> 06:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
members if those elected officials stood
 
06:42:23.350 --> 06:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
more forcefully against things like
 
06:42:25.788 --> 06:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
right to work in union busting
 
06:42:28.430 --> 06:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
legislation oh I can say most certainly
 
06:42:30.230 --> 06:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
and from people I know who are involved
 
06:42:33.948 --> 06:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
in Union leadership like Peggy um they
 
06:42:36.230 --> 06:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
see through their cope organizations
 
06:42:38.708 --> 06:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
these people tell them how they vote and
 
06:42:41.270 --> 06:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
I can say definitely at her local it's
 
06:42:43.310 --> 06:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
just like New Hampshire it is a third
 
06:42:45.468 --> 06:42:45.478 align:start position:0%
Republican third Democrat and the third
 
06:42:47.708 --> 06:42:47.718 align:start position:0%
independent and as Representatives we
 
06:42:50.110 --> 06:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
all live and die by how the people who
 
06:42:52.868 --> 06:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
are The Independents feel about us so I
 
06:42:54.190 --> 06:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
look it as an opport
 
06:42:54.200 --> 06:42:55.590 align:start position:0%
look it as an opport
you

06:42:55.590 --> 06:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:42:58.070 --> 06:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
know the most conservative thing anyone
 
06:43:00.948 --> 06:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
can do is nothing just leave everything
 
06:43:03.190 --> 06:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
alone and that's what people who are
 
06:43:04.948 --> 06:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
Republican union members and independent
 
06:43:07.270 --> 06:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
union members are really asking for here
 
06:43:09.150 --> 06:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
it's not the I want a pony for Christmas
 
06:43:11.070 --> 06:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
laundry list of legislative changes they
 
06:43:13.510 --> 06:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
want they're really just asking you just
 
06:43:15.510 --> 06:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
let it go don't do anything in this
 
06:43:17.230 --> 06:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
particular situation and that's pretty
 
06:43:19.468 --> 06:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
easy to deliver
 
06:43:21.788 --> 06:43:21.798 align:start position:0%
on thank
 
06:43:23.708 --> 06:43:23.718 align:start position:0%
you right see no other question
 
06:43:27.190 --> 06:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
06:43:29.868 --> 06:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
testimony so that's phase one that
 
06:43:33.868 --> 06:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:35.990 --> 06:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
list this concludes the list of
 
06:43:37.830 --> 06:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
individuals but I know we have one
 
06:43:40.868 --> 06:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
individual Pat Moren was contacted
 
06:43:43.110 --> 06:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
Christina and then we have individuals
 
06:43:46.150 --> 06:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
on the telephone so I would
 
06:43:49.510 --> 06:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh recognize Pat Moren if you are here
 
06:43:49.520 --> 06:43:52.590 align:start position:0%
uh recognize Pat Moren if you are here
with

06:43:52.590 --> 06:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:55.670 --> 06:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
us hello Mr chairman can you hear me
 
06:43:59.750 --> 06:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay yes we can okay thank you very much
 
06:44:01.430 --> 06:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
for taking your time and the committee
 
06:44:04.510 --> 06:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
members as well my name is Pat Moran and
 
06:44:07.150 --> 06:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
I am a proud Union member and chief
 
06:44:09.388 --> 06:44:09.398 align:start position:0%
steart of the International Brotherhood
 
06:44:11.948 --> 06:44:11.958 align:start position:0%
of Electrical Workers Local
 
06:44:17.350 --> 06:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
1837 the IB the IBEW 1837 is a utility
 
06:44:19.708 --> 06:44:19.718 align:start position:0%
Union with members in both New Hampshire
 
06:44:22.468 --> 06:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
and Maine I feel strongly that Senate
 
06:44:26.350 --> 06:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 61 the so-called Right to Work bill
 
06:44:29.270 --> 06:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
does not bring does not belong in the
 
06:44:32.548 --> 06:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I believe this is a means to
 
06:44:35.788 --> 06:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
break unions the name itself is a
 
06:44:38.750 --> 06:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
lie Right to Work does not give anyone
 
06:44:42.230 --> 06:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
any rights or any work it is meant to
 
06:44:45.750 --> 06:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
hurt unions financially in the hope that
 
06:44:50.070 --> 06:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
they will further wither and die unions
 
06:44:53.070 --> 06:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
operate like any business a much needed
 
06:44:54.948 --> 06:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
business for hardworking men and women
 
06:44:54.958 --> 06:44:56.670 align:start position:0%
business for hardworking men and women
like

06:44:56.670 --> 06:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:44:59.708 --> 06:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
myself much like any other business when
 
06:45:02.590 --> 06:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
a Bill gets introduced such as
 
06:45:05.670 --> 06:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
sb61 that makes businesses work for
 
06:45:08.510 --> 06:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
someone that is not required to pay
 
06:45:11.150 --> 06:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
their fair share eventually that
 
06:45:13.948 --> 06:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
business is not receiving Fair
 
06:45:15.948 --> 06:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
compensation for the work that they

06:49:34.388 --> 06:49:34.398 align:start position:0%
speak right to work is the name of a
 
06:49:37.590 --> 06:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
policy designed to take away rights from
 
06:49:42.110 --> 06:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
working people backers of this claim the
 
06:49:44.510 --> 06:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
laws protect workers against being
 
06:49:48.270 --> 06:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
forced to join a union the reality is
 
06:49:52.030 --> 06:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
that federal law already does
 
06:49:55.670 --> 06:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
this the real purpose of right to work
 
06:49:59.070 --> 06:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
laws is to tilt the balance towards
 
06:50:03.030 --> 06:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
corporations and further rig the system
 
06:50:05.948 --> 06:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
at the expense of work and
 
06:50:08.830 --> 06:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
families this law makes it harder for
 
06:50:12.190 --> 06:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
people to form unions and collectively
 
06:50:14.910 --> 06:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
bargain for better wages benefits and
 
06:50:14.920 --> 06:50:16.910 align:start position:0%
bargain for better wages benefits and
working

06:50:16.910 --> 06:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
working
 
06:50:19.590 --> 06:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
conditions every freeloader that takes
 
06:50:23.030 --> 06:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of higher wages benefits and
 
06:50:25.910 --> 06:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
working conditions that unions provide
 
06:50:29.430 --> 06:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
will not pay in any cost diminishes the
 
06:50:32.948 --> 06:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
Union's ability to service all workers
 
06:50:32.958 --> 06:50:35.230 align:start position:0%
Union's ability to service all workers

06:50:38.070 --> 06:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
represents I worked in a right to work
 
06:50:40.948 --> 06:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
state and the only thing it did was
 
06:50:44.388 --> 06:50:44.398 align:start position:0%
divide the workforce it was not a
 
06:50:48.590 --> 06:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:51.468 --> 06:50:51.478 align:start position:0%

right to work or as many call it the
 
06:51:45.788 --> 06:51:45.798 align:start position:0%
right to work for Less bill sp61 is bad
 
06:51:48.628 --> 06:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire this bill is not new
 
06:51:51.708 --> 06:51:51.718 align:start position:0%
and it's often been presented in all 50
 
06:51:53.868 --> 06:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
states thanks to special interest groups
 
06:51:56.468 --> 06:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
like Alec similar bills written by other
 
06:51:57.990 --> 06:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
corporations or groups like The C
 
06:52:00.948 --> 06:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
Brothers funded groups um I'm
 
06:52:03.430 --> 06:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
disappointed that many pay forplay
 
06:52:06.388 --> 06:52:06.398 align:start position:0%
legislators often Republicans have their
 
06:52:08.070 --> 06:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
hands out to the corporations and C
 
06:52:09.868 --> 06:52:09.878 align:start position:0%
brother billionaires to do their dirty
 
06:52:12.030 --> 06:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
work so they can increase their offshore
 
06:52:15.030 --> 06:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
bank account wealth and take advantage
 
06:52:19.030 --> 06:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
of Labor workers by squeezing them
 
06:52:21.670 --> 06:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
financially legislators often present
 
06:52:23.310 --> 06:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
these toxic bills in exchange for
 
06:52:26.070 --> 06:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
campaign donations or pen pushing high
 
06:52:27.708 --> 06:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
paying future jobs when they leave their
 
06:52:32.070 --> 06:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
political seats this sb61 bill hurts
 
06:52:34.548 --> 06:52:34.558 align:start position:0%
hardworking Americans Martin Luther King
 
06:52:37.350 --> 06:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
is likely rolling in his grave today his
 
06:52:39.270 --> 06:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
goal of protecting the sanitation
 
06:52:40.948 --> 06:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
workers who are getting injured on the
 
06:52:44.150 --> 06:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
job in 1968 was accomplished by the
 
06:52:46.868 --> 06:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
creation of a union this bill is a
 
06:52:48.990 --> 06:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
disaster for New Hampshire and kind of
 
06:52:52.430 --> 06:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
reminds me of the 2010 BP Oil explosion
 
06:52:54.830 --> 06:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
type of event waiting to happen where
 
06:52:56.750 --> 06:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
the company paid fines instead of fixing
 
06:52:58.468 --> 06:52:58.478 align:start position:0%
the problems to protect workers who are
 
06:53:01.708 --> 06:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
blown off the oil rigs unions negotiate
 
06:53:04.310 --> 06:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
safety protections this bill would allow
 
06:53:06.110 --> 06:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
corporations to offer below poverty
 
06:53:08.590 --> 06:53:08.600 align:start position:0%
wages cut basic benefits that every
 
06:53:11.388 --> 06:53:11.398 align:start position:0%
American deserves for a hard week of pay
 
06:53:14.270 --> 06:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
of work without these labor workers
 
06:53:15.628 --> 06:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
there would be no profits for the
 
06:53:18.190 --> 06:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
corporate pen pushers at the top please
 
06:53:20.788 --> 06:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
do not support this disastrous Bill and
 
06:53:22.708 --> 06:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
yes unions sometimes endorse or support
 
06:53:24.910 --> 06:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
support political candidates who protect
 
06:53:26.468 --> 06:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
their values and workers instead of
 
06:53:28.110 --> 06:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
allowing a schmuck who doesn't give a
 
06:53:30.350 --> 06:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
darn about the safety or well-being of
 
06:53:33.310 --> 06:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
our workers even more reason to support
 
06:53:36.548 --> 06:53:36.558 align:start position:0%
the more decent candidates and I heard a
 
06:53:40.230 --> 06:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
lady earlier mention um the origins of
 
06:53:43.868 --> 06:53:43.878 align:start position:0%
these type of bills with racist tones
 
06:53:46.190 --> 06:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
and I read the article and I was
 
06:53:49.350 --> 06:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
appalled of where this began uh and she
 
06:53:52.070 --> 06:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
was right about the the um people not
 
06:53:53.948 --> 06:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
wanting to work with people who are
 
06:53:57.548 --> 06:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
black or Jews so I hope you refute this
 
06:54:00.310 --> 06:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill once again it keeps coming back
 
06:54:02.230 --> 06:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's annoying and I hope you vote
 
06:54:03.670 --> 06:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
against it and do the right thing for

07:02:34.510 --> 07:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
I've been also a proud UPS Teamster uh
 
07:02:39.230 --> 07:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
I've been at UPS for 27 years and I am
 
07:02:42.110 --> 07:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
in the minority as a republican uh in
 
07:02:45.750 --> 07:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
the union however I do want to uh talk
 
07:02:48.590 --> 07:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
about that uh like many hardworking
 
07:02:50.910 --> 07:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
essential employees over the past year
 
07:02:52.628 --> 07:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic
 
07:02:55.510 --> 07:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
we've worked six days a week up up to 60
 
07:02:55.520 --> 07:02:56.590 align:start position:0%
we've worked six days a week up up to 60
70

07:02:56.590 --> 07:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
70
 
07:03:00.590 --> 07:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
hours um we swayed this past election
 
07:03:04.150 --> 07:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
the hardworking people uh based on you
 
07:03:06.150 --> 07:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
know we we supported the governor and
 
07:03:08.670 --> 07:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
how he was handling the pandemic uh we
 
07:03:10.910 --> 07:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
were turned off by the opposition and
 
07:03:13.868 --> 07:03:13.878 align:start position:0%
some of the things that were said um
 
07:03:17.110 --> 07:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
after this past year I'm I'm kind of
 
07:03:19.270 --> 07:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
upset that the timing that this would
 
07:03:22.548 --> 07:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
come forward now but but being being uh
 
07:03:25.110 --> 07:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
being an individual I see that the right
 
07:03:27.910 --> 07:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
to work has the prime opportunity here
 
07:03:31.310 --> 07:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of of the popularity
 
07:03:34.230 --> 07:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh of the governor um I voted for
 
07:03:37.350 --> 07:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
Senator Reagan and representative Spain
 
07:03:40.750 --> 07:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
in 20120 and then I sat in the senate
 
07:03:44.628 --> 07:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
committee and listened to Senator Reagan
 
07:03:46.468 --> 07:03:46.478 align:start position:0%
uh basically tell the committee to
 
07:03:48.910 --> 07:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
disregard my comments as a union worker
 
07:03:51.270 --> 07:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
because I was only riled up by the by
 
07:03:52.628 --> 07:03:52.638 align:start position:0%
the Union
 
07:03:56.350 --> 07:03:56.360 align:start position:0%
he also stated that uh that this would
 
07:03:59.150 --> 07:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
possibly attract companies he also
 
07:04:01.270 --> 07:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
stated that the people that this will
 
07:04:04.830 --> 07:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
benefit don't even know who they are yet
 
07:04:07.230 --> 07:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
and like I said when in the senate
 
07:04:09.150 --> 07:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
committee the people that this could
 
07:04:12.468 --> 07:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
hurt we do know who we are this
 
07:04:15.590 --> 07:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
continues to come up as a partisan issue
 
07:04:17.750 --> 07:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh where the money goes to the
 
07:04:20.030 --> 07:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
Republican Party a party that I
 
07:04:23.270 --> 07:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
affiliate myself with a and they try to
 
07:04:25.388 --> 07:04:25.398 align:start position:0%
move this agenda
 
07:04:28.788 --> 07:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
forward as a hardworking six day a week
 
07:04:31.708 --> 07:04:31.718 align:start position:0%
60h hour a week worker I don't have time
 
07:04:33.910 --> 07:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
to be tuned into a lot and neither do a
 
07:04:36.190 --> 07:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
lot of our other employees and I'd like
 
07:04:39.510 --> 07:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
to thank Senator Reagan for tuning me in
 
07:04:42.750 --> 07:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
um because I'm not going away and
 
07:04:45.270 --> 07:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
neither is the four voters in my house
 
07:04:50.468 --> 07:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
and the others who who he disregarded uh
 
07:04:53.468 --> 07:04:53.478 align:start position:0%
and said we shouldn't have voice we work
 
07:04:56.030 --> 07:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
hard I work hard for my money I have two
 
07:04:58.628 --> 07:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
sons one of them went to college and is
 
07:05:01.070 --> 07:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
an engineering manager the other one has
 
07:05:04.788 --> 07:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
joined me at UPS my son that's uh an
 
07:05:08.510 --> 07:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
engineer engineering manager uh has
 
07:05:11.708 --> 07:05:11.718 align:start position:0%
$70,000 in college debt whereas my son
 
07:05:14.150 --> 07:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's working with me at UPS has zero
 
07:05:17.388 --> 07:05:17.398 align:start position:0%
debt um he used the money uh from his
 
07:05:20.350 --> 07:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
his paying job at UPS and has gone to
 
07:05:22.110 --> 07:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
Community College and and is going to
 
07:05:25.030 --> 07:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
get his associates degree
 
07:05:28.910 --> 07:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
um in 2017 this the the right to work
 
07:05:32.670 --> 07:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
was defeated when 32 Brave Republicans
 
07:05:37.150 --> 07:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
voted against it 32 in the house um
 
07:05:38.708 --> 07:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
following that there was a lot of
 
07:05:42.230 --> 07:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
Fallout uh Jeanie Forester uh in a press
 
07:05:44.030 --> 07:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
conference at that time the state
 
07:05:46.430 --> 07:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
Republican party chairman said for those
 
07:05:48.590 --> 07:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
that supported the governor they will be
 
07:05:51.150 --> 07:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
rewarded in the next election cycle with
 
07:05:54.030 --> 07:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
campaign funds Greg Moore who you heard
 
07:05:57.070 --> 07:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
from earlier from the Americans for
 
07:06:01.030 --> 07:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
Prosperity uh in a uh speaking about the
 
07:06:03.910 --> 07:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
defeat of the right to work in 2017 told
 
07:06:06.750 --> 07:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
the union leader we're not going away
 
07:06:09.628 --> 07:06:09.638 align:start position:0%
and as far as the 32 Republicans have I
 
07:06:11.750 --> 07:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned we don't treat uh pledge
 
07:06:15.030 --> 07:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
Breakers very well referring to uh
 
07:06:17.868 --> 07:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
representative from Seabrook and I
 
07:06:20.270 --> 07:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
believe the other one was from Derry I
 
07:06:22.510 --> 07:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
fear the strong armed tactics could be
 
07:06:27.430 --> 07:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
in place today and I I beg of you my
 
07:06:30.990 --> 07:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
fellow Republicans to choose me choose
 
07:06:34.430 --> 07:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
my family choose the workers over
 
07:06:37.788 --> 07:06:37.798 align:start position:0%
corporations at UPS we have a we have a
 
07:06:40.350 --> 07:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
a phrase it's it's called trust your gut
 
07:06:42.670 --> 07:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
and when you're driving your vehicle and
 
07:06:44.590 --> 07:06:44.600 align:start position:0%
something doesn't feel right and a
 
07:06:46.310 --> 07:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
situation doesn't feel right it's
 
07:06:49.110 --> 07:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
probably not right this right to work
 
07:06:52.070 --> 07:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is not right please be brave
 
07:06:54.948 --> 07:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
please support me so I can continue to
 
07:06:59.430 --> 07:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
support the Republican party that I love
 
07:07:03.388 --> 07:07:03.398 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for your
 
07:07:06.868 --> 07:07:06.878 align:start position:0%

O'Brien see none that legislative office
 
07:07:40.910 --> 07:07:40.920 align:start position:0%

07:07:54.868 --> 07:07:54.878 align:start position:0%

07:08:06.388 --> 07:08:06.398 align:start position:0%
chairman and committee thank you for
 
07:08:08.270 --> 07:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
taking time to hear my
 
07:08:12.510 --> 07:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um my name is Patrick Burns I
 
07:08:15.510 --> 07:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
am a proud uh Marine Corps veteran
 
07:08:18.670 --> 07:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
father of three husband and a proud
 
07:08:22.310 --> 07:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
Teamster of uh local 633 who happens to
 
07:08:24.150 --> 07:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
be a registered
 
07:08:27.868 --> 07:08:27.878 align:start position:0%
Republican I am here today to oppose
 
07:08:30.468 --> 07:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
sp61 for several reasons there was a lot
 
07:08:33.868 --> 07:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
of good testimony today that I had to
 
07:08:37.990 --> 07:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
clean up my speech a little bit but
 
07:08:41.110 --> 07:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
um just to go over what the way I feel
 
07:08:43.468 --> 07:08:43.478 align:start position:0%
about this is that it's unamerican
 
07:08:45.750 --> 07:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to dictate to a business
 
07:08:51.468 --> 07:08:51.478 align:start position:0%
being a union how they can operate on a
 
07:08:54.030 --> 07:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
daily basis
 
07:08:58.708 --> 07:08:58.718 align:start position:0%
um telling them that
 
07:08:58.718 --> 07:09:00.310 align:start position:0%
um telling them that
you

07:09:00.310 --> 07:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:09:03.830 --> 07:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
you you won't be able to you know pay
 
07:09:06.750 --> 07:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
union dues um you're not required to pay
 
07:09:09.468 --> 07:09:09.478 align:start position:0%
union dues which is GNA hurt the bottom
 
07:09:11.388 --> 07:09:11.398 align:start position:0%
line of the Union it is a
 
07:09:16.030 --> 07:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
business okay just like in previous
 
07:09:19.190 --> 07:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um regarding
 
07:09:21.350 --> 07:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
memberships you know services are not
 
07:09:22.430 --> 07:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
not going to be
 
07:09:26.350 --> 07:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
rendered so s sp61 severely impacts the
 
07:09:28.230 --> 07:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
future of the existence of our Union our
 
07:09:30.310 --> 07:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
jobs and our benefits that have been
 
07:09:34.310 --> 07:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
earned Through Blood Sweat and
 
07:09:37.788 --> 07:09:37.798 align:start position:0%
Tears um this law being a big push for
 
07:09:40.270 --> 07:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
Republicans was a big surprise to me
 
07:09:41.910 --> 07:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
because historically speaking
 
07:09:44.548 --> 07:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
Republicans are for limited government
 
07:09:46.590 --> 07:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
regulations learning the national Right
 
07:09:49.868 --> 07:09:49.878 align:start position:0%
to Work committee out of Virginia being
 
07:09:52.150 --> 07:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
a special interest group has donated
 
07:09:54.548 --> 07:09:54.558 align:start position:0%
money to various politicians so this
 
07:09:56.990 --> 07:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
kind of made sense to me the union
 
07:09:59.190 --> 07:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
leader just recently posted on
 
07:10:02.948 --> 07:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
312 of this year that $100,000 was
 
07:10:08.788 --> 07:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
donated to 10 GOP candidates okay in the
 
07:10:10.990 --> 07:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
in the midst of a pandemic prioritizing
 
07:10:13.310 --> 07:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
a bill that only helps a special
 
07:10:16.388 --> 07:10:16.398 align:start position:0%
interest group politicians and hurts the
 
07:10:18.430 --> 07:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
working class is
 
07:10:20.468 --> 07:10:20.478 align:start position:0%
baffling politicians are supposed to
 
07:10:22.190 --> 07:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
listen to consti
 
07:10:23.788 --> 07:10:23.798 align:start position:0%
I think the one thing that we can learn
 
07:10:27.350 --> 07:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
from today that we've heard a lot of
 
07:10:30.590 --> 07:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and I can only tell you that
 
07:10:35.190 --> 07:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
I've heard a handful of in favor of most
 
07:10:40.190 --> 07:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
of the um testimony today was against so
 
07:10:43.510 --> 07:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
you're all duly elected officials okay
 
07:10:45.750 --> 07:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
you're supposed you you work for the
 
07:10:48.510 --> 07:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire so with that
 
07:10:51.628 --> 07:10:51.638 align:start position:0%
being said you're supposed to listen to
 
07:10:51.638 --> 07:10:52.750 align:start position:0%
being said you're supposed to listen to
your

07:10:52.750 --> 07:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
07:10:56.270 --> 07:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
constituents I am a shop steward at my
 
07:10:59.590 --> 07:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
at my at my place of work okay and the
 
07:11:02.190 --> 07:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
one phrase that I say to my members is
 
07:11:05.310 --> 07:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
that I don't speak for you I speak on
 
07:11:08.430 --> 07:11:08.440 align:start position:0%

committee all right um there was there
 
07:11:22.590 --> 07:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
was very similar testimony but
 
07:11:24.310 --> 07:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes as we know it our
 
07:11:26.350 --> 07:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
dly elected officials I'll listen to the
 
07:11:28.510 --> 07:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
spe special interest groups they're not
 
07:11:32.708 --> 07:11:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:36.910 --> 07:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
constituents so the you know the one
 
07:11:38.510 --> 07:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
thing that really has me concerned about
 
07:11:42.510 --> 07:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is 273 D9 all right the
 
07:11:42.520 --> 07:11:43.590 align:start position:0%
this bill is 273 D9 all right the
penalty

07:11:43.590 --> 07:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
07:11:47.030 --> 07:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
section right so you can say whatever
 
07:11:49.230 --> 07:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
you want that this this you know is
 
07:11:52.430 --> 07:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
Union Bus and which it is okay but this
 
07:11:54.910 --> 07:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
is a this is an unconstitutional Bill if
 
07:11:57.030 --> 07:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
you read it okay the penalties any
 
07:11:59.708 --> 07:11:59.718 align:start position:0%
person opposing to someone not paying
 
07:12:04.948 --> 07:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
dues can face a, fine or face prison not
 
07:12:09.350 --> 07:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
exceeding 90 days or both so with that
 
07:12:12.150 --> 07:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
being said this this law would would
 
07:12:14.388 --> 07:12:14.398 align:start position:0%
allow a company
 
07:12:17.628 --> 07:12:17.638 align:start position:0%
to you know like an HR upon orientation
 
07:12:20.230 --> 07:12:20.240 align:start position:0%

07:12:25.788 --> 07:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
who pay member that you know here are
 
07:12:28.788 --> 07:12:28.798 align:start position:0%

07:13:51.510 --> 07:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
Teamster member of local 633 here in New
 
07:13:54.830 --> 07:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am a registered independent
 
07:13:59.030 --> 07:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
voter I was a sharp Steward for 27 years
 
07:14:01.990 --> 07:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
at the company I worked for I am now a
 
07:14:04.388 --> 07:14:04.398 align:start position:0%
field rep for the
 
07:14:06.388 --> 07:14:06.398 align:start position:0%
teamsters this
 
07:14:09.070 --> 07:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
bill in my mind and I don't want to off
 
07:14:10.548 --> 07:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
anybody is
 
07:14:12.388 --> 07:14:12.398 align:start position:0%
ridiculous you
 
07:14:17.708 --> 07:14:17.718 align:start position:0%
hear people call in on zoom on the phone
 
07:14:18.910 --> 07:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
against this
 
07:14:21.788 --> 07:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
bill every time this comes
 
07:14:25.590 --> 07:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
up you don't hear companies in the state
 
07:14:28.750 --> 07:14:28.760 align:start position:0%
coming forward saying we want this bill
 
07:14:30.030 --> 07:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
because it's going to bring jobs it's
 
07:14:31.628 --> 07:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
not going to bring
 
07:14:34.990 --> 07:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
jobs you know I hear testimony today
 
07:14:38.310 --> 07:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
that people say well how does it lower
 
07:14:41.430 --> 07:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
wages how does it impact
 
07:14:44.070 --> 07:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining what happens is because I've
 
07:14:46.708 --> 07:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
talked to people in right to work states
 
07:14:50.270 --> 07:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
that over time the members that decide
 
07:14:53.270 --> 07:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
not to pay Union does the companies know
 
07:14:57.388 --> 07:14:57.398 align:start position:0%
who they are and that makes it weaker to
 
07:14:59.910 --> 07:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
negotiate a contract the companies know
 
07:15:02.030 --> 07:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
that that's how they divide and
 
07:15:06.548 --> 07:15:06.558 align:start position:0%
conquer that's how it erods wages
 
07:15:09.150 --> 07:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
benefits and drives everything down
 
07:15:10.468 --> 07:15:10.478 align:start position:0%
that's why it's called a race to the
 
07:15:12.310 --> 07:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
bottom for right to
 
07:15:16.430 --> 07:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
work it makes no sense to me I'm going
 
07:15:20.350 --> 07:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
to use an analogy that I used last time
 
07:15:22.310 --> 07:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
your D driving down 93 in New Hampshire
 
07:15:24.310 --> 07:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
you get a flat tire you call
 
07:15:26.430 --> 07:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
triaa they're going to ask you are you a
 
07:15:29.030 --> 07:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
member you paying a member dues you say
 
07:15:30.948 --> 07:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
no you're gonna be sitting there all day
 
07:15:32.310 --> 07:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
that's the same thing that this bill
 
07:15:35.708 --> 07:15:35.718 align:start position:0%
does for unions this bill goes forward
 
07:15:38.670 --> 07:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
unions have to represent the non-union
 
07:15:42.310 --> 07:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
people in a group that's federal law and
 
07:15:43.708 --> 07:15:43.718 align:start position:0%
I heard somebody say that that wasn't
 
07:15:46.468 --> 07:15:46.478 align:start position:0%
the case it is the
 
07:15:49.628 --> 07:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
case me being a steward if I have a
 
07:15:51.788 --> 07:15:51.798 align:start position:0%
person that's not paying dues
 
07:15:54.110 --> 07:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't represent him I get in
 
07:15:56.590 --> 07:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
trouble the union gets in
 
07:15:58.708 --> 07:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
trouble that's why this bill does not
 
07:16:00.670 --> 07:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
make sense to me because that means
 
07:16:02.788 --> 07:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
people are getting services for free
 
07:16:04.590 --> 07:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
anybody that owns a company doesn't work
 
07:16:04.600 --> 07:16:05.868 align:start position:0%
anybody that owns a company doesn't work
for

07:16:05.868 --> 07:16:05.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
07:16:08.590 --> 07:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
free I'm opposed to this bill and I hope
 
07:16:11.548 --> 07:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
that all the testimony you hear
 
07:16:13.670 --> 07:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
today lets people know that you're going
 
07:16:15.990 --> 07:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
to vote this down this bill is not good
 
07:16:17.788 --> 07:16:17.798 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire no New Hampshire
 
07:16:21.110 --> 07:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
person came forward to sponsor this bill
 
07:16:23.110 --> 07:16:23.120 align:start position:0%

07:18:49.948 --> 07:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
surprising then that US News and World
 
07:18:52.230 --> 07:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
Report recently ranked New Hampshire as
 
07:18:54.910 --> 07:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
a number two in the country up from five
 
07:18:57.910 --> 07:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
in previous year we have a growing and
 
07:19:00.670 --> 07:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
resilient economy our education system
 
07:19:02.830 --> 07:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
is rated as one of the best when we have
 
07:19:05.510 --> 07:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
a housing storage shortage because so
 
07:19:08.430 --> 07:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
many people want to live here organized
 
07:19:10.388 --> 07:19:10.398 align:start position:0%
labor isn't holding New Hampshire back
 
07:19:12.708 --> 07:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
as supporters of s sp61 might have you
 
07:19:15.388 --> 07:19:15.398 align:start position:0%
believe in fact organized labor the
 
07:19:16.990 --> 07:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
hardworking men and women of New
 
07:19:20.510 --> 07:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are integral are an integral
 
07:19:23.548 --> 07:19:23.558 align:start position:0%
to our economy and quality of life would
 
07:19:26.788 --> 07:19:26.798 align:start position:0%
it surprise you that 15 out of 20 States
 
07:19:29.270 --> 07:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh the Right to Work For Less States
 
07:19:31.430 --> 07:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
this data alone should be reason enough
 
07:19:34.990 --> 07:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
to cause pause and ask passing this law
 
07:19:37.670 --> 07:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
helps New Hampshire
 
07:19:37.680 --> 07:19:39.830 align:start position:0%
helps New Hampshire
how

07:19:39.830 --> 07:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
how
 
07:19:42.270 --> 07:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh I guess in
 
07:19:45.628 --> 07:19:45.638 align:start position:0%
conclusion I want to say please remember
 
07:19:48.830 --> 07:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
you were elected to office by the people
 
07:19:51.548 --> 07:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
for the people for the people of New
 
07:19:55.468 --> 07:19:55.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:57.990 --> 07:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr for your testimony
 
07:19:59.510 --> 07:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
there any questions of the presenter
 
07:20:02.230 --> 07:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
here in the lob representative turot yes
 
07:20:06.468 --> 07:20:06.478 align:start position:0%
thank uh Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
07:20:08.708 --> 07:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
Ells for the question I've heard heard
 
07:20:11.110 --> 07:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
this twice today and I'm trying to kind
 
07:20:13.910 --> 07:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
of understand that somehow could you
 
07:20:15.948 --> 07:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
explain the relationship between right
 
07:20:19.310 --> 07:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
to work and child mortality
 
07:20:21.670 --> 07:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
rates that's
 
07:20:24.030 --> 07:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
correct the reason for that is because
 
07:20:25.708 --> 07:20:25.718 align:start position:0%
you have less money if you don't have
 
07:20:28.708 --> 07:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
the unions to get that money up there
 
07:20:30.230 --> 07:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
you have less people that have
 
07:20:32.670 --> 07:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
hospitalization less people more people
 
07:20:34.750 --> 07:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
actually that aren't taking their child
 
07:20:35.990 --> 07:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
to the hospital because they can't
 
07:20:38.670 --> 07:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
afford to because they don't have that
 
07:20:42.350 --> 07:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
insurance it all follows
 
07:20:45.708 --> 07:20:45.718 align:start position:0%

07:22:00.990 --> 07:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
letting me speak uh my name is David
 
07:22:04.388 --> 07:22:04.398 align:start position:0%
Holt I'm calling in opposition to S sp61
 
07:22:07.070 --> 07:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh the right to work for Les Bill uh I'm
 
07:22:08.910 --> 07:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
a lifelong New Hampshire native and
 
07:22:10.590 --> 07:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
currently a homeowner and taxpayer in
 
07:22:12.910 --> 07:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
the city of summersworth New Hampshire I
 
07:22:14.910 --> 07:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
am a proud Union member belonging to the
 
07:22:16.548 --> 07:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
Coalition of Union employees and a
 
07:22:18.230 --> 07:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
member of our Labor Management committee
 
07:22:19.270 --> 07:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
which is just one of the ways that
 
07:22:21.468 --> 07:22:21.478 align:start position:0%
unions work with employers to improve
 
07:22:24.628 --> 07:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
the workplace to make our organization
 
07:22:27.150 --> 07:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
successful uh Right to Work For Less is
 
07:22:28.910 --> 07:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
wrong for New Hampshire it is an attack
 
07:22:30.388 --> 07:22:30.398 align:start position:0%
on working people in New Hampshire
 
07:22:32.230 --> 07:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
because when you talk about unions you
 
07:22:34.468 --> 07:22:34.478 align:start position:0%
are talking about working people not
 
07:22:37.310 --> 07:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
some quote unquote other entity like the
 
07:22:38.830 --> 07:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
organizations that are pushing these
 
07:22:41.270 --> 07:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
bills the labor leaders that have called
 
07:22:43.308 --> 07:22:43.318 align:start position:0%
in are working people that were part of
 
07:22:45.548 --> 07:22:45.558 align:start position:0%
their Union and were elected to lead by
 
07:22:48.070 --> 07:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
their co-workers uh can the people
 
07:22:50.190 --> 07:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
trying to influence New Hampshire's
 
07:22:51.788 --> 07:22:51.798 align:start position:0%
legislation from outof State
 
07:22:53.670 --> 07:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
organizations say the same was the
 
07:22:55.388 --> 07:22:55.398 align:start position:0%
director of the national Right to Work
 
07:22:57.150 --> 07:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
For Less organization elected to
 
07:22:58.948 --> 07:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
represent their members or were they
 
07:23:01.548 --> 07:23:01.558 align:start position:0%
hired by and paid by multi-billionaires
 
07:23:03.548 --> 07:23:03.558 align:start position:0%
that use their dark money to fund
 
07:23:05.430 --> 07:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
organizations like right to work for Les
 
07:23:07.590 --> 07:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
or Alec and others that attack working
 
07:23:10.070 --> 07:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
people to make the rich richer uh New
 
07:23:12.190 --> 07:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not need to be told how
 
07:23:13.708 --> 07:23:13.718 align:start position:0%
to run Itself by these big money
 
07:23:15.670 --> 07:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
interests we need to protect working
 
07:23:17.590 --> 07:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
people that is the true function of
 
07:23:19.350 --> 07:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
government to ensure that all citizens
 
07:23:21.230 --> 07:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
are taken care care of and are treated
 
07:23:23.590 --> 07:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
fairly we must not pass Right to Work
 
07:23:25.388 --> 07:23:25.398 align:start position:0%
For Less this is moving New Hampshire
 
07:23:28.030 --> 07:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
backward you have been given uh evidence
 
07:23:29.670 --> 07:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
over and over that it lowers wages and
 
07:23:32.308 --> 07:23:32.318 align:start position:0%
makes work areas less safe if you do not
 
07:23:33.990 --> 07:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
vote inexpedient to legislate on this
 
07:23:35.590 --> 07:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
horrible bill then you are not serving
 
07:23:36.990 --> 07:23:37.000 align:start position:0%

sb61 um my husband was a member of the
 
07:24:33.190 --> 07:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
Nea New Hampshire teachers union for 25
 
07:24:36.468 --> 07:24:36.478 align:start position:0%
years and we were delighted when all the
 
07:24:38.708 --> 07:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
public unions became right to work after
 
07:24:40.510 --> 07:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
the Janice Supreme Court
 
07:24:43.670 --> 07:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
ruling the teachers union suddenly cared
 
07:24:45.510 --> 07:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
about the teachers and started reaching
 
07:24:48.270 --> 07:24:48.280 align:start position:0%
out and asking him what he
 
07:24:50.948 --> 07:24:50.958 align:start position:0%
needed and that meant as Republicans we
 
07:24:52.510 --> 07:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
could stop giving money to an
 
07:24:55.270 --> 07:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
organization that turned around and used
 
07:24:58.270 --> 07:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
it to get Democrats elected and Lobby
 
07:25:00.868 --> 07:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
for political causes we
 
07:25:03.468 --> 07:25:03.478 align:start position:0%
despise I feel it's terribly unfair that
 
07:25:05.110 --> 07:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
those who work under private unions
 
07:25:08.350 --> 07:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the same Freedom we did why
 
07:25:10.110 --> 07:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
should someone have to pay an annual fee
 
07:25:12.388 --> 07:25:12.398 align:start position:0%
to an organization in order to get a job
 
07:25:14.230 --> 07:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's like paying protection
 
07:25:17.308 --> 07:25:17.318 align:start position:0%
money public workers already have right
 
07:25:19.548 --> 07:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
to work and all the dire predictions
 
07:25:22.788 --> 07:25:22.798 align:start position:0%
about union busting have not occurred
 
07:25:24.990 --> 07:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
why should P private workers not have
 
07:25:27.628 --> 07:25:27.638 align:start position:0%
the same rights please protect workers
 
07:25:31.270 --> 07:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
rights and vote ought to pass on sb61
