300 miles of roads and parking lots and
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
we are now in in the middle of our
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
winter season where we oversee the
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
management of 7 000 miles of snowmobile
 
00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:25.310 align:start position:0%

our agency's broad scope of services is
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
also Illustrated in how we touched the
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
daily lives of our citizens in every
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
community of the state our programs
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
grants and services have only expanded
 
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
as a result of the covid pandemic for
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
example the division of historical
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
resources required project review and
 
00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
compliance program experienced a 30
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:52.019 align:start position:0%
growth is the key word in this budget
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
request our state parks have seen
 
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
significant growth in attendance online
 
00:15:59.750 --> 00:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
reservations camping and retail sales to
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
respond to this growth our State Park
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
season has grown to 36 weeks opening
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
earlier in the spring and staying open
 
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
beyond Columbus Day
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
similarly the division of forests and
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
lands is also experiencing growth we've
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
helped to conserve several thousand more
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
Acres available for public access and
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
our forest rangers are seeing a lot more
 
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
activity consistent with the growth in
 
00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation
 
00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:24.779 align:start position:0%

the previous year's marks
 
00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
sales income increased 52 percent from
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
2021's record-breaking season and
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
reflected a
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
146.7 percent increase since 2018.
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
the total number of orders was up 37.6
 
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
percent from last year which is just
 
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
about double 96.5 percent compared to
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
five years ago
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
the number of seedlings seedlings lifted
 
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
sorted for Quality packaged and sold
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
increased 50.8 percent from 2021 a 135.2
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
percent jump from 2018.
 
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
in order to respond to this overall
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
growth we have evaluated our staffing
 
00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:08.339 align:start position:0%
needs and are requesting permission to
 
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
convert eight nine T positions into
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
full-time positions within parks and 190
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
to permanent full-time within the
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources we
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
would also like to add an additional
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
forest ranger and an additional Forester
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
to assist us in monitoring over 270
 
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
000 Acres of private land under
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
conservation easements
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
I'm also seeking your support for three
 
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:34.740 align:start position:0%
positions in the office of the
 
00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.110 align:start position:0%
positions in the office of the
commissioner

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
this agency relies on the legal advice
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
of the Attorney General's office over
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
the past several years it's become
 
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
increasingly clear that with the number
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
of contracts lease agreements rulemaking
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
and day-to-day interactions with the
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
public there is enough work to support a
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
full-time agency attorney
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
I've discussed this need with the doj's
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
attorneys that have been assigned to us
 
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
and they wholeheartedly agree
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
another full-time position I wish to
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
fill with your support is a dncr
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
financial analyst specializing in
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
Federal grant Administration
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
from the land and water conservation
 
00:18:12.409 --> 00:18:12.419 align:start position:0%
fund to the National Endowment for the
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
Arts and the U.S forest Service are five
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
divisions administer millions of federal
 
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
grants every year and rather than
 
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
continue to oversee a very siled attempt
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
to pull this off each grant grant round
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
our staff would benefit from the support
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
of a centralized service position and I
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
suspect the team at Das would also
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate the efficiency of working
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
with a central point person rather than

the many individual Grant administrators
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
sprinkled throughout our agency
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
finally a position I have advocated for
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
in the past and truly believe will be a
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
game changer for us is having a dncr
 
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.090 align:start position:0%
game changer for us is having a dncr
curator

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
curator
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
as part of our mission we are to provide
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
access to the many Treasures that we
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
manage this includes artwork historic
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
items archaeological finds collections
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
that have been donated to us and more
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
my vision is to hire someone who can
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
help us organize our treasures and then
 
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
help to develop public-facing exhibits
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
and programs at our State library at our
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
parks and historic sites and even
 
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
traveling exhibits to schools local
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
public libraries and other community
 
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.270 align:start position:0%
public libraries and other community
centers

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
we are currently seeking a consultant
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
through the RFQ process to access the
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
state library's current space and
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
provide us with a plan to to store much
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the stacks in a climate-controlled
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
storage facility freeing up valuable
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
space for exciting and endless
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
opportunities to engage the public
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
other considerations in this budget
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
request include accounting for dramatic
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
increases in our utility expenses and
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
inter-agency transfers
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
something I would like to point out for
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
discussion is the fact that since 2007
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
when the Bureau of historic sites was
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
created it was General funded
 
00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:51.539 align:start position:0%
this was done on purpose in order to
 
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
dedicate funds to the stewardship and
 
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
management of our designated historic
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
sites separating them from Parks funding
 
00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:00.299 align:start position:0%
which was which has ebbed and flowed
 
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
historic sites also have a separate
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
Mission from Parks which is telling the
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
stories of who we are through buildings
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
Landscapes Collections and Exhibits
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
two years ago when we were asked to cut
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
our overall general fund budget we did
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
so without compromising our commitment
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
to the Bureau of historic sites instead
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
we shifted Park revenue over which you
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
will see as what we did again this
 
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:23.870 align:start position:0%
will see as what we did again this
budget

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
shifting back to General funds is
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
something we would like to discuss
 
00:20:27.059 --> 00:20:29.510 align:start position:0%
something we would like to discuss
further

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
looking at our prioritized needs we are
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
making these requests consistent with
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
our theme of growth and demand New
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's artists cultural
 
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
organizations and for-profit venues were
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
hit very hard during the pandemic and
 
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
are not fully recovered a recent survey
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
of 53 non-profit grantees
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
most of which receive Art Council

operating support showed 2022 earned
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue to date at 78 of the
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic levels this is consistent
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
with natural National Trends and is
 
00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:00.230 align:start position:0%
with natural National Trends and is
troubling

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
troubling
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
additional State assistance will be
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
needed for the fiscal year 2425 biennium
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
as they reorient their business models
 
00:21:09.409 --> 00:21:09.419 align:start position:0%
to what may be the new normal
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
we are also seeing an opportunity to
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
push Beyond critical needs to support
 
00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:15.419 align:start position:0%
the state's cultural Assets in a way
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
that fulfills The increased demand from
 
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:19.820 align:start position:0%
the public throughout this sector
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
specifically requests for operating
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
support have increased significantly as
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
organic organizations mature and become
 
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
eligible for Grants applications to this
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
two-year program increased 30 percent in
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%

biennium
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
requests to the Arts and health grant
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
program have also increased a 33 percent
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
increase we project continued growth in
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
this program as pandemic recovery
 
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
continues particularly in the areas of
 
00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059 align:start position:0%

services

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
due to this growth we are requesting a
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
new grants coordinator position to lead
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
the Arts entrepreneurial grant program
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
continues to grow as artists build the
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
build and diversify their careers and
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
and there is a marked need for capacity
 
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
building support for the emerging Arts
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
organizations particularly in the areas
 
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
of financial management and fund
 
00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.690 align:start position:0%
of financial management and fund
development

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
much as the state allocated funds to
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
boost outdoor recreation to meet the
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
needs of the public we see similar
 
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
demand and opportunity within the Arts
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
you will also see a request to support
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire public television
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
historically New Hampshire PBS was
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
supported by the state through UNH 2.7
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
million annually but funding was
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
eliminated in 2011.
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire PBS will utilize the
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
requested funds to provide the state and
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
country with engaging local content that
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
showcases the state's Rich natural
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
cultural historical and environmental
 
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.430 align:start position:0%
cultural historical and environmental
resources

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
some of the programming New Hampshire
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
PBS will produce include our music and
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
arts Heritage and how it impacts the New
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
documentaries about New Hampshire's
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
hidden history
 
00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
are diverse new populations the vibrant
 
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:09.299 align:start position:0%
Farm to Table movement and much more
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
the amount requested will simply pass
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
through our agency to New Hampshire PBS
 
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
but by allocating it to the council in
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
the Arts we can count this money towards
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
our federal match this is a strategic
 
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
way to make every dollar work hard for
 
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
in conclusion the dncr has sustained
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
substantial growth over the past few
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
years and in order to move ahead on this
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
trajectory we have identified specific
 
00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
opportunities to put the pedal to the
 
00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
metal while staying within the three
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
percent general fund growth limitation
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
and by offsetting the new positions we
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
need with several vacant positions that
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
we can abolish
 
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
I open this to conversation
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%

about how we will reach a match so that
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
we can maintain the uh the the amount of
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%

g-i-n-n-i-e and the last name is Lupi l
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
u p as in Paul I
 
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
so we have to match dollar for dollar
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
every dollar that we receive from the
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
National Endowment for the Arts so we
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
have an annual process that we go
 
00:24:58.850 --> 00:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
through with the Nea to apply for
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
partnership funds we expect in our next
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
Grant to receive close to 935 thousand
 
00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:07.730 align:start position:0%
Grant to receive close to 935 thousand
dollars

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
and so over the years we have become
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
very creative in how we make that match
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
because our general fund allocation has
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
been historically very low
 
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.590 align:start position:0%
been historically very low
we

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
count our general fund allocation we
 
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
also manage the state's percent for art
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
program and that is a program that Ebbs
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
and flows depending on uh
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
construction of new state buildings or
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
Renovations so we would use whatever we
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
get that year in projects toward the
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
match we also count the Moose plate Arts
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
conservation Grant funds that we receive
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
toward the match and so by requesting an
 
00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:51.419 align:start position:0%
increase in our state grants line in
 
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
this budget we will be able to
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
comfortably make our match without
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
having to rely on Revenue sources that
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
are not consistent
 
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:04.340 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah so
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
you said make your match does that mean
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's a maximum amount that could be
 
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.470 align:start position:0%
there's a maximum amount that could be
matched

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
matched
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
yes we have to match our Federal grant
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
dollar for dollar so if we receive 935
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
000 from the Nea in a particular year we
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
have to match that with State funds
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
no that's not my my question is suppose
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
we spent two million dollars would the
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
FED send us two million dollars or not
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not so so our our amount
 
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
is is exactly 935
 
00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
000 yes
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
that's the amount that we have to match
 
00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
we would gratefully accept more funds
 
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
from the state for us to be able to
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
Grant out into the community all right
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
so my question is if we gave you a
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
million would they match a million no no
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
that's a it's exactly that yeah all
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
right and if we gave you 500
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
000 they would give you 500 000. yes um
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
no no it really works the other it's the
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
other way around so the National
 
00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
Endowment for the Arts makes a
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
determination based on a formula that
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
they use to Grant funds to State Arts
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
agencies and then is it up it is up to
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
the state to match whatever we get from
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.279 --> 00:27:27.649 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
so are you saying it's either 935
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
000 or zero
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
no we actually in the years that we were
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
completely unable to make the match we
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
applied for waivers with the National
 
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
Endowment for the Arts to be able to be
 
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
able to continue to receive that Federal
 
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.330 align:start position:0%
able to continue to receive that Federal
money

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:49.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
please also what Jenny's um expressing
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
is if we don't if we know we're not
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
going to get 935
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
000 from the general fund we then we
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
then account for the Moose plate fund
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
the percent for Arts which is an RSA
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
that says if the state builds a new
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
public building one half of one half one
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
half of one percent of that cost goes
 
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.070 align:start position:0%
half of one percent of that cost goes
into

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
um uh going out to bid to local artists
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
to come up with a piece of artwork for
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
that building that allocation can be
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
counted as part of the match but we
 
00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:24.419 align:start position:0%
can't predict that number every year so
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
it's that's where the creativity comes
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
we try really hard to match match it
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
dollar for dollar if we can't then we're
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
shorting ourselves from that National
 
00:28:33.059 --> 00:28:34.909 align:start position:0%
shorting ourselves from that National
Funds

00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
Funds
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
I see yeah so well we're about to build
 
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
a 25 million dollar parking garage
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
that's 250 000 in percent here all right
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
yeah so all right let's try again so is
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
does the 935 000 is that 2023's number
 
00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
is it the bienniums number
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
what was it last biennium so we we are
 
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
expecting an increase of about a hundred
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
and twelve thousand dollars for Federal
 
00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 which will support our
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
I want to ask about the Tramway yeah at
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
some point yeah let me let me just quick
 
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
so this this uh public television thing
 
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.710 align:start position:0%
so this this uh public television thing
um

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's asking for 2.7 million
 
00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.210 align:start position:0%
that's asking for 2.7 million
no

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
no that the the 2.7 million is what
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
historically the state allocated to PBS
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
through UNH that was cut off
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
in 2011. so they have not received any
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
state funding since 2011. right so they
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
have asked
 
00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:53.330 align:start position:0%
have asked
um

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
or is it I think 500 500 000 per year
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
2024 and 500 000 2025 to come to them
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
from the state through the Council on
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
the Arts which is where we can then
 
00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.389 align:start position:0%
the Arts which is where we can then
count

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
count
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
500 000 in 2024 and 500 000 in 2025 to
 
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
match the federal money which is a huge
 
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.149 align:start position:0%
match the federal money which is a huge
relief

00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
relief
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
because we can benefit from that match
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't sound that way to me but
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
anyway all right why don't we go to the
 
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
so uh there's a bill to spend 25 million
 
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
so uh there's a bill to spend 25 million
dollars

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
um for improving the Tramway or
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
something for operations what's the
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
situation there and and uh how has
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
maintenance is is this a problem that
 
00:30:48.169 --> 00:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
maintenance was not adequate over time
 
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
and then I'll ask um director Wilson to
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
help me
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize we had a fact sheet
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
that um we presented at the hearing SB
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
55 hearing and I didn't even think
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
to bring it today but I can email it out
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
and it's on our website so
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
in 1934
 
00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
uh the state legislature
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
um agreed that the tram would be a a
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
magnificent tourist attraction in New
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and supported funding the tram
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
and it was built which really kicked off
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
um summer tourism as well as supporting
 
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
the ski industry in Franco de naturally
 
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.269 align:start position:0%
the ski industry in Franco de naturally
Park

00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
Park
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
fast forward to 1977 when they realized
 
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
they needed to read that trans lifespan
 
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
was over again went to the legislature
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
again they supported it and in 1980 uh
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
the tram2 which you can write today was
 
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.230 align:start position:0%
the tram2 which you can write today was
established

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
with a 40-year life expectancy we're now
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
at 43 years starting two years ago we
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
started bringing this need forward in
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
our Capital discussions
 
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
um so that it wouldn't be a sudden need
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
we would have time to do some studies
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
and we have so we have spoken at length
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
to the uh the company that manages the
 
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
equipments doppelmeyer which is fun to
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
say and they warn us that while the tram
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
is safe right now and we check it every
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
day the parts are so Antiquated that
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
when they break we're not going to be
 
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
able to find replacement parts so we
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
have confidence that the tram is going
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
to run just fine this this season the
 
00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
summer season which brings us two
 
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars in revenue for the state
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
park system
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
and we want to be able to um
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
well we're asking the legislature to
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
decide is this something that New
 
00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:48.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants to invest in again
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
um working with Das and their division
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
of Public Works the ballpark number that
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
they put forward is 25 million dollars
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's where we're turning for
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
help to decipher where does that come
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
from we brought it before Gopher for
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
arpa funds we've brought it to the
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
capital budget just by saying we don't
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
know where this where you want to
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
allocate These funds from and so where
 
00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
we are today is
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
at a decision point where we hit the
 
00:33:23.889 --> 00:33:23.899 align:start position:0%
85th Anniversary of the tram this summer
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
and we would like Clarity on where we're
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
going to go for the next 45 years with
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
the tram
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
thank you sure so
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
um if if the tram was was
 
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
discontinued does that end skiing at
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
Cannon altogether absolutely not oh okay
 
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
so Cannon Mountain which is part of
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
Franconia Notch State Park runs the tram
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
in the winter time maybe three days a
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
week it supplements the skiing it's
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
another place for skiers to find
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
Adventure all those Trails can be
 
00:33:58.930 --> 00:33:58.940 align:start position:0%
accessed by other lifts as well
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
the tram the trams busy season and where
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
we gain the revenue is in the spring
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
summer and fall
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
where we have busloads of of tourists
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
and um and people who you know go to the
 
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
bed and breakfast and say what should we
 
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
do today
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
how much revenue does the tram bring in
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
per year two point something million a
 
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.349 align:start position:0%
per year two point something million a
year

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
so that seems reasonable to continue now
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
to me this sounds like a capital budget
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
obvious sort of thing have have you gone
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
to the public works committee and they
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
turned you down so the capital budget is
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
only a certain amount every year right
 
00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
they have 120 million to spend yes so
 
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
they were hoping that there was another
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
Magic Bullet
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
25 million seems to be like the number
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we've heard on a lot of projects
 
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.790 align:start position:0%
that we've heard on a lot of projects
yeah

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
so further questions of the commissioner
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
I I have a few good
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned a number of new
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
positions I didn't tally them all up how
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
many folks are you looking to add to the
 
00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.470 align:start position:0%
many folks are you looking to add to the
Department

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.750 align:start position:0%
Department
so

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
the three new full-time positions I that
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
I um described for the commissioner's
 
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.450 align:start position:0%
I um described for the commissioner's
office

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:35:22.089 --> 00:35:22.099 align:start position:0%
um are
 
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
we can abolish three positions for those
 
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.690 align:start position:0%
we can abolish three positions for those
three

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:29.900 align:start position:0%
um the nine T's that we would want to
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
change over to full time
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
would be counted as additional I guess
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
even though they already are people but
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
we want to make them full-time and then
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
there are two uh division of forests and
 
00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:47.220 align:start position:0%
lands new positions and one Arts
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
position so
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
all things being equal it's three
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
new positions above and beyond what we
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
currently have okay
 
00:35:59.810 --> 00:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
so representative Murray had a question
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
she asked me to ask you and that's on
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
the Mansion over in Newcastle the
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
wedding the old Governor's Mansion oh
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah how I guess there was some activity
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
planned last year to do some renovation
 
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
and she was just kind of curious where
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
everything stood and if you need
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
additional funding for
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
upgrade and so this is the Wentworth
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
Coolidge Mansion
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
um if you haven't been you must go it's
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
amazing uh we just did some work
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
um in interior work to replace the
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
historic wallpaper
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
um which uh which was a major and
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
impressive overhaul of that room and
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
experience I'm looking at Brian Wilson
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
who's our historic expert in the room to
 
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
see if he has specific updates on other
 
00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:57.829 align:start position:0%
see if he has specific updates on other
projects

00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
um so the Wentworth Coolidge Mansion
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
um the Billiards room as it's known uh
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
just had uh its wallpaper
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
um uh redone it was a room where
 
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.410 align:start position:0%
um uh redone it was a room where
actually

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
um a silverfish will eat paper they they
 
00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:13.730 align:start position:0%
um a silverfish will eat paper they they
like

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
um cellulose and that entire room of
 
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
18th century wallpaper was eaten over
 
00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
the last last 50 years and so that room
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
um was completely done
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
um the floor all the painting the
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
wallpaper plaster work there is other
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
work going on right now which is the
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
repair of the sea wall which protects
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
the easternmost side of the foundation
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
to the building
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
and then there's other work planned
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
um that will come out of a historic
 
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
structures report that's being done I
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
believe this spring and that is to look
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
at all of the Interior
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
um deal with moisture issues
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
um uh freshen up the paint on the
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
interior as well as do some other
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
wallpaper conservation work it still has
 
00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:10.020 align:start position:0%
its original 18th century flocked
 
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
wallpaper in two rooms which is
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
um I think there are four rooms in
 
00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
America that still have these um these
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
papers on them and and we own one of
 
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:25.370 align:start position:0%
papers on them and and we own one of
them

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you not just for him not specific
 
00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
what is a tax credit project
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
um through the National Park Service if
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
um you were to buy a historic building
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
down on Main Street here
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
um or even this building
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and you wanted to put it into uh
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%

credit
 
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.150 align:start position:0%
credit
um so

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
um uh it's a it's a very popular program
 
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
amongst developers who want to retain
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
the historic nature of a building but
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
also make it useful today and add the
 
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
modern amenities and that sort of thing
 
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
so we work in consultation with the
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
developer and The Architects to make
 
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
is that 20 of the purchase price of the
 
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
building or the the amount the work done
 
00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:23.579 align:start position:0%
to fix it up of the appraised value
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
after the work is done
 
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
oh I see and is it sort of automatic
 
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.510 align:start position:0%
oh I see and is it sort of automatic
that

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh it uh it yes it can be um it's a it's
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
a length assuming you did the work
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
correctly and that sort of thing and
 
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's why we work very closely
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
um with uh with the folks doing the work
 
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:44.700 align:start position:0%
and and how what the scope is and that
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and then we send off all
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
of that information to the park service
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
and they actually do the approvals the
 
00:39:52.609 --> 00:39:52.619 align:start position:0%
final approvals but it's a very popular
 
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
project program yeah
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is our resident
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
engineer which
 
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:14.460 align:start position:0%
so I guess I have a couple of questions
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
so the division has been actually
 
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:23.660 align:start position:0%
wrestling with an issue over in Dairy
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's the trail the rail trail it runs
 
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
from Salem to Manchester and this little
 
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:29.660 align:start position:0%
stub that's
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%
lacking connectivity I guess would be
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
the right word and there's a
 
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
rather a contentious issue between the
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
town and the rail trail people and the
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
bicyclists and I'm asking you this
 
00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
question because the commissioner got
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
involved with a very contentious issue
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
in Peterborough
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
where we had uh issues with the D.O.T
 
00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
the puc and eversource and it took about
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
five years right that we got all the
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
people together and came up with a
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
solution that everybody was happy with
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
which was amazing and I got to give
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
Sarah a lot of credit because it the
 
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:11.099 align:start position:0%
initial stage we were told that the her
 
00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
Department had no say-so really in the
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
issue it was a p-u-c-d-o-t issue and
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
when it came around Sarah stepped up
 
00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
we have people involved with the um
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
Trails people in the area and uh it
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
worked out well so how do as far as
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
managing these state-owned
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
Trails is the trail from Manchester to
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
Salem is that I know some of it's owned
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
by the state or how does that all work
 
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
as far as your agency in the trails
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau managing these Trails it is so
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
complicated oh here we go
 
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.930 align:start position:0%
complicated oh here we go
um

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
I can't speak specifically to the Salem
 
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester one but what I can say is
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
what you described illustrates a common
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
challenge around the state the good news
 
00:41:59.569 --> 00:41:59.579 align:start position:0%
is there are a lot of people that value
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
our trail system right for a variety of
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
reasons and we should have room for
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
everybody we should have room for people
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
who want to walk their dog and people
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
who want to ride their fat bikes in the
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
winter and people who want to ride their
 
00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.450 align:start position:0%
winter and people who want to ride their
machines

00:42:11.450 --> 00:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
so we have the Bureau of trails that is
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
within the division of Parks and
 
00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:17.230 align:start position:0%
within the division of Parks and
Recreation

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
Recreation
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
and that Bureau is I'll be honest mostly
 
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
focused on motorized vehicle trails
 
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
because that's where their funding comes
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
from registrations from snowmobiles and
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
ATVs we have decided as a department
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
that we need to pay
 
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
out of a Parks fund for a full-time
 
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
employee to help manage the
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
non-motorized activity on our Trails
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
because currently there is not a a phone
 
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
number at a desk where non-motorized
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
constituents feel like they have an
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
advocate in the state agency we work
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
with them closely we partner with them
 
00:43:00.349 --> 00:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
they're they're represented on our state
 
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh you know Committees of advisors for
 
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
the trails Etc but but it's it's getting
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
busy out there and more complicated we
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
work very closely with DOT because they
 
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
do have a lot of jurisdiction over the
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
rail trails that you articulated and
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
they have invested a lot of time and
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
hired a consulting firm to come up with
 
00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:20.339 align:start position:0%
a vision for rail trail development
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and our staff is
 
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
working in concert with that that's a
 
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:28.980 align:start position:0%
long-term plan A lot of these challenges
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
are just sort of whack-a-mole right now
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out how we can find
 
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
solutions that work for local
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
constituents and sometimes it works out
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
fine and sometimes it's more it's more
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
complicated one of the requests that we
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
put forth for arpa funds and it was
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
approved and now we're working through
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
the process of making our Dream Come
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
True is
 
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.250 align:start position:0%
True is
um

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
creating a GIS mapping tool for state
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
agencies and municipalities decision
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
makers to be all on the same page when
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're having conversations about Trails
 
00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:02.420 align:start position:0%
right now there is not a comprehensive
 
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
Current Online mapping tool for all of
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
the trails in New Hampshire and we need
 
00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
to make decisions in real time based on
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
safety if a trail is washed out and you
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
know Fish and Game needs to know that we
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
have to close this part of the trail we
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
also have to make decisions based on
 
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
private landowner rights state issues
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
conservation easements and so having one
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive color-coded place where we
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
can update information in real time and
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
prioritize these types of conversations
 
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
will be a game changer I think for the
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
trails system in New Hampshire in the
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
meantime like I said it is complicated
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
and we're having a lot of one-off
 
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.329 align:start position:0%
and we're having a lot of one-off
conversations

00:44:46.329 --> 00:44:46.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
representative hatch followed by
 
00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you in terms of enforcement for
 
00:44:59.569 --> 00:44:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:02.099 align:start position:0%
I get a lot of activity with in my
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
district over this and I get a lot of
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
constituent calls with people
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
um either confused or unsure of where
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
they need to go for enforcement type of
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
activities and things they need
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
addressed and who do they contact local
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
police the fish and game or whomever and
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
they've been told all of the above
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstance
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
so if we
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
as we're increasing the trails in the
 
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
activity on them has there been any
 
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
effort to uh put Clarity to this or what
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate venue uh because I've
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
had a plethora of Interest yeah
 
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
um inquiring about this
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
for enforcement or even just information
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
before having trouble finding the right
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
person to talk to about what they
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't is there a lot of this yeah
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly so
 
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
so where does that sit I guess thank you
 
00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:05.579 align:start position:0%
uh great question uh we have a wonderful
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the fish and
 
00:46:07.319 --> 00:46:08.750 align:start position:0%
working relationship with the fish and
game

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
game
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
um and it's a daily conversation between
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
their CEOs who are out in the woods and
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
are forest rangers that are also out in
 
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
the woods so in our division of forest
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
and lands and you see I because of the
 
00:46:20.569 --> 00:46:20.579 align:start position:0%
growth of activity in in The Great
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
Outdoors we are seeking an additional
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
forest ranger to help because we did a
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
an informal audit among our forest
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
rangers just to get an understanding of
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
what percentage of their time is being
 
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
spent on trail
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
um issues and they with confidence say
 
00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
about 20 and that's a new number for
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
them this wasn't usually it's not a
 
00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
typical or historic um piece of work for
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
them uh so our forest rangers and our
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
CEOs are out in the woods
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh and when they can it's it's a lot of
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
Education we have people renting the
 
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
machinery and they don't realize they're
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
on private land and they're here for a
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
weekend and then they're going to go
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
back and so there's a a real push to
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
educate the respect for the land
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
um that they're recreating on it to
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
understand that so we're having that
 
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
conversation the CEOs
 
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
are doing the best they can I'm sure
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
director Mason can speak to his needs
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
um in terms of his his troop uh and then
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
when it comes to towns that have agreed
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
to allow Vehicles ATVs on their actual
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
town roads uh that comes that comes down
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
to their own town law abilities and some
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
towns are recognizing I think dumberston
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
voted down the opportunity because they
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
don't have law enforcement on their
 
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:41.750 align:start position:0%
don't have law enforcement on their
roads

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
roads
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
um so it would be challenging we our
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
forest rangers aren't on town roads
 
00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
pulling people over so we're just in the
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
woods so may I just along this um where
 
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
does the sheriff's department for
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
different counties intersect with this
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
because there's a I think there's needs
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
to be some clarity to the subject and
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the best way
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
um best laws are yeah the best method to
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
get there but it is a problem
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
not only do we work closely with the
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
sheriffs the county sheriffs but many of
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
the county sheriff's staff come from the
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
Bureau of trails and forests and land
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
staff so we know them personally
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
um but uh there has there has to be you
 
00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
know sort of documented agreements and
 
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we can supplement
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
and what they can supplement which is an
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
exercise that we go through in real time
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at director Patrick Hackley
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you want to say anything
 
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
about coax County at this point because
 
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
he's had these conversations over the
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
last couple months with kowas County
 
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
which you can imagine is very busy in
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
this Arena
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
um sure I can project from the back you
 
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
know unfortunately you've got to use
 
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and just your full name and with
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
Patrick Hackley director for the
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
division of forest and Lance
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
so as commissioner Stewart said
 
00:49:09.359 --> 00:49:10.490 align:start position:0%
so as commissioner Stewart said
um

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
my most of my experience now in terms of
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh interaction between the sheriff the
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
County Sheriff's Office and our Rangers
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
is kawas County so we'll just use that
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
as the primary example
 
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
the Sheriff's Office up in co-host does
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
a darn good job of policing the trails
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
they have the bandwidth as as
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioners said they also have three
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
of our retired Rangers that work for
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
their office so they know the back roads
 
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
they know the trails and I and I believe
 
00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:38.579 align:start position:0%
that the Sheriff's Office and their
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
deputies have a good working
 
00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
relationship also with Fish and Game
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
conservation officers so there's three
 
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement entities out there on the
 
00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339 align:start position:0%
trails in the North country as you can
 
00:49:47.339 --> 00:49:48.309 align:start position:0%
trails in the North country as you can
imagine

00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're all needed because of the the
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
capacity that those trails get they get
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of use
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
so I believe our relationship is pretty
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
solid uh with uh the county sheriff's
 
00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.329 align:start position:0%
solid uh with uh the county sheriff's
office

00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
um but they are needed uh uh enforcement
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
agency when it comes to the trails and
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
speeding and registrations and things
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.589 align:start position:0%
like that
um

00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that the CEOs for fish and
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
game could say the same thing that that
 
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
it's a welcomed participation but as of
 
00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have any formal mou
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
with the sheriff's office that might be
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
something we
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
explore but we have in our fiscal year
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
24 25 budget requested another Ranger
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that this ohrv Enforcement issue is
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
specifically one of the reasons we're
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
asking for to to add another Ranger
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
um so yeah
 
00:50:43.319 --> 00:50:44.050 align:start position:0%
um so yeah
um

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:44.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
on this line
 
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:51.020 align:start position:0%
you don't have a
 
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding which I
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
would I thought one was being developed
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
goes back in koas County yes a year ago
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
I mean but I undoubtedly was given
 
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
um I think it was a good idea if there
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
was but I'm not aware that one was in
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
play okay and here here goes to my query
 
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
and my concern is is um
 
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
who's coordinating this and that's what
 
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
needs to happen is that something uh
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
seems like your agency has most of the
 
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
problems with with this activity so is
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
this something you're coordinating of
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
course the sheriff's department thinks
 
00:51:32.569 --> 00:51:32.579 align:start position:0%
they I think it's done very much so at
 
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
the local level so the sheriff the
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
sheriff uh will speak with our chief so
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
Chief Steve Sherman he's the head of our
 
00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:40.859 align:start position:0%
forest Protection Bureau and that's
 
00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
that's where our Rangers that's that's
 
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
the the bureau that they work under so I
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
believe those conversations occur
 
00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:47.930 align:start position:0%
believe those conversations occur
between

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
the sheriff the county sheriff our chief
 
00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
and then I think it's Mike Eastman Mike
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
Eastman with the wild so the three of
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
them communicate and however they work
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
it out I have not heard of any
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
particular conflicts
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
between the agencies but it I think it's
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
this good relationship housekeeping
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
maybe and I'd be willing to explore an
 
00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:10.940 align:start position:0%
mou if that's what you're recommending
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
if I may I think I think um that might
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
be a good opportunity I think that
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
should be explored it's just I don't
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily get feedback from the
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department or the Rangers
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
um I get feedback from constituents and
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
people who utilize it and and
 
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
um concerns about they lack direction as
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
to what yeah
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
is correct or what they should or
 
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:41.220 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing sure you know I mean
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
in my mind it's common sense but yeah
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
well we would like that to Prevail
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
usually but it doesn't always especially
 
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
out in the ohrv trails right but um what
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
what era do you represent what's your
 
00:52:51.119 --> 00:52:52.030 align:start position:0%
what era do you represent what's your
question

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
oh yeah oh yeah well there you go yeah
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
that Gorham
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so that is that is the county
 
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
of of interest when it comes to HRV and
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
snowmobile enforcement
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm open to that we've been working
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
with the Sheriff's Office not so much
 
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
with the fish and wildlife because I
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
think they have their routes that they
 
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.470 align:start position:0%
think they have their routes that they
Patrol

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
Patrol
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's not uh just just to be clear
 
00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:19.430 align:start position:0%
it's it's not uh just just to be clear
though

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
um we do it because our as the
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner said our staff is out in
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
the woods already that's where their
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement jurisdiction is particularly
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
on dncr lands but also on private lands
 
00:53:33.049 --> 00:53:33.059 align:start position:0%
when it comes to forestry laws and
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
Wildfire prevention and suppression so
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
those are the two pillars of their
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement Forestry uh water quality
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
violations in partnership with Des so if
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
they discover logging jobs are affecting
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
water quality they reach out to Des and
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
then any any Wildfire activity fire
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
permits Etc ohrvs has crept into their
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
their Suite of enforcement duties
 
00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of the you know
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
the explosion of that that sport
 
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
particularly in the North Country so
 
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.170 align:start position:0%
particularly in the North Country so
um

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I think it's probably a
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
good idea I'm going to be presenting to
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
the uh the cause County delegation
 
00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
actually uh you'll probably be there on
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
the 27th on Monday uh the 27th so
 
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:14.990 align:start position:0%
the 27th on Monday uh the 27th so
um

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to explore that conversation
 
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
if you think it would help if if your
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
constituents are concerned about
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
bad behavior on the trails than than the
 
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
three enforcement agencies should be
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
talking saying who's going to be where
 
00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:30.059 align:start position:0%
this weekend that kind of thing I think
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's it makes sense just one more uh
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
concern along that venue
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
um you you take care of the registration
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
who takes what agency Fish and Game
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
takes care of the registration so um
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
what happens is there's a
 
00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
ohrvs out there with non-appropriate
 
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
equipment on them and make noise or they
 
00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
don't have the proper noise
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
Mufflers or whatever so uh fishing game
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
is the primary source for that but okay
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
good we'll see okay thank you all right
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire thank you Mr chair so
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
on the mapping project of trails are you
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
doing that with the granite system
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with that so we are in
 
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh We've convened sort of the gis
 
00:55:30.049 --> 00:55:30.059 align:start position:0%
experts from all the agencies that are
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
using GIS to figure out what what the
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
bet we don't want to start something new
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
if there's a platform that we can
 
00:55:37.849 --> 00:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
already use we've talked to 9-1-1 we've
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
talked to dot we've talked to uh fish
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
and game so I don't know what the
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
current iteration of that conversation
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
is but we certainly aren't doing this
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
without consultation with other say
 
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
agencies to get something that will work
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
for everybody yeah because that system
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
is fantastic it's
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
g-r-a-n-i-t no e yeah right and it's got
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
layers for
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
um topology and Roads and all this sort
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
of stuff and you can choose what layers
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
you want to see at any given time and
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
you could easily have a snowmobile layer
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
and a trail layer and you know all that
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
kind of thing I'm with with certainty I
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
can say that that has been a
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
conversation yeah okay good now as long
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
as you're here we're running out of time
 
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.030 align:start position:0%
as you're here we're running out of time
um

00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
your agency takes in a lot of Revenue
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
right so can you give us the big picture
 
00:56:29.809 --> 00:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
kind of number of what's your Revenue
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.599 --> 00:56:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we have
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
so other funds right other funds what
 
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
are other funds well other funds mostly
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
in our agency are the revenues that we
 
00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
generate through Parks and Recreation
 
00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the pie charts you
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
can see DNC are other fund Source mix
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
Parks and Recreation 80 percent
 
00:57:08.089 --> 00:57:08.099 align:start position:0%
of their funding is other funds which
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
means Revenue force and lands you know
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
almost five million dollars of Revenue
 
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
so a bulk of of the
 
00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.030 align:start position:0%
so a bulk of of the
um

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh well by RSA state parks have to be
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
operationally self-funded so in order to
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
open a park in order to clean the
 
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
bathrooms in order to hire an employee
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
and give them a give them a uniform we
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
need to charge at the door to get in
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
um and so our number one
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
funding source as you can imagine
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
93 state parks only half of them we
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
charge at
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
and of that half only half make make a
 
00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:49.069 align:start position:0%
and of that half only half make make a
profit

00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
so we really lean on Franconia Notch
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
state park for their extra Revenue we
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
really lean on Hampton Beach for the
 
00:57:59.089 --> 00:57:59.099 align:start position:0%
parking revenue and there's other
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
Pawtuckaway other state parks that do
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
well enough that they can chip in to
 
00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:06.780 align:start position:0%
support the other state parks it's our
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
mission to be accessible so we don't
 
00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
want to have escalating rates all the
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
time to
 
00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:16.740 align:start position:0%
um to deter a family of four from
 
00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
Manchester to have a wonderful Park
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
experience we want to be affordable and
 
00:58:22.849 --> 00:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
that's part of our mission so we we run
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves like a business in the Parks
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
department and as I alluded to in my
 
00:58:31.329 --> 00:58:31.339 align:start position:0%
remarks a lot of our forests and lands
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
are our enterprise system there is
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
growing and we want to capture that
 
00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
what's the yeah thank you what is the
 
00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:41.460 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office pie what does that
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
consist I was looking at that myself I I
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna have to get back to you on
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
that one specifically
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
um because I do not sell things from
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
that commissioner and then and then this
 
00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
whole circle is the red one to the right
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
right so other fans the other funds and
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
then there's federal funds and you have
 
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
14 General correct business is good
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing a good job
 
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and we reflect uh that in my remarks
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
with recognizing if we want to sustain
 
00:59:18.289 --> 00:59:18.299 align:start position:0%
it we need to you know hire where where
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
it's strategically important
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
I've always um I see here that we have 3
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
700 plus a minus archaeological sites
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
I've always wondered what what makes a
 
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
site what is the criteria of the site to
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
archaeological oh good question I'm a
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
little trouble with big words yeah so
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
um one of our best kept secrets is that
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
we this division this department is home
 
00:59:58.970 --> 00:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
to our state archaeologists um and
 
01:00:00.770 --> 01:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
they're amazing and they have so many
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
treasures and as a mom of three little
 
01:00:05.329 --> 01:00:05.339 align:start position:0%
kids it kills me that we're not taking
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
these treasures and bringing them to
 
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
every school in the state because it's
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
really remarkable
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
um we I'll let Ben speak to the science
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
behind Discerning an archaeological site
 
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
but uh you know well I'll just let him
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
explain it because I'm not a scientist
 
01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
it's a great question
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
um so you can stick a shovel anywhere in
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the ground and come up
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
with a archaeological site basically but
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
these are sites that have actually been
 
01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:42.770 align:start position:0%
these are sites that have actually been
dug

01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
dug
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
um and recorded so for instance whenever
 
01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:50.780 align:start position:0%
dot does a highway widening project
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
there's an archaeological component to
 
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
it as well as above ground resource
 
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
components so if there's a stone wall
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
that has to be moved or or a Cellar hole
 
01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
something like that so each time a
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
project like that is taken on it creates
 
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
another site basically there are some
 
01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:12.980 align:start position:0%
more important sites
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
pre-contact sites we have 12 500 years
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
of history of inhabitants in New
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
those are more specific sites where
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
um it's somebody an archaeologist
 
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
looking to to frame the history of of
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
that certain group of people
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
how they moved around and lived and that
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so I I guess I was
 
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's a criteria
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
you know so many years of
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
what the criteria is
 
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:50.569 align:start position:0%
what the criteria is
um

01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
to um to actually call it a an
 
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:57.059 align:start position:0%
archaeological site you know that's a
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
good question that might be above my pay
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
grade I'm not an archaeologist a trained
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
archaeologist I'm an architectural
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
historian preservationist and I can
 
01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:08.900 align:start position:0%
certainly get that information to you
 
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
but archaeologists like to think that
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
you know the beer can that's thrown out
 
01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:15.380 align:start position:0%
the car window
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
could possibly be an archaeological site
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
at some at some point
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
um so it's um I think it's a fairly
 
01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:24.890 align:start position:0%
um so it's um I think it's a fairly
vague

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
vague
 
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.230 align:start position:0%
vague
um definition

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
um definition
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
um but we spend a lot of our time
 
01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
um looking at at archeology as it
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
pertains to federally uh funded and
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
state-funded uh projects around the
 
01:02:39.599 --> 01:02:42.770 align:start position:0%
state-funded uh projects around the
state

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin probably has what
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
the largest license plate collection
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
around and so his site might be
 
01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:53.180 align:start position:0%
considered an archaeological site
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.690 --> 01:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
alternating so
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
um so we do maintain an archeology lab a
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
laboratory uh and I I won't mention
 
01:03:17.809 --> 01:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
where it is but
 
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
um uh just for safety sake and um but we
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
we curate all of the things that are
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
found in the state from all of these
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
projects for other agencies as well as
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
for our own agency and
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
um it's uh vastly
 
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.450 align:start position:0%
um it's uh vastly
um

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh under uh well it's over utilized and
 
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
um and we do need more space
 
01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
um it's our hope that um that we'll be
 
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
able to move into a another building
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
actually at the same location
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
um temporarily
 
01:03:55.849 --> 01:03:55.859 align:start position:0%
um but um it's it's really our Dream
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's our commissioner's dream to create
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
um to create basically a museum for all
 
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
of the things that we have we have
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
artwork we have collections we have all
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
of our archeology uh bits and pieces
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
which are are fascinating and um and
 
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
we'd like to Showcase those uh to the
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire and and our
 
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.849 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire and and our
visitors

01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
visitors
 
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
so um but our archeology lab and I'm
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
happy to give a tour uh the state
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
archaeologist would be happy to give a
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
tour to anybody that wants to see that
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
any further questions I do have one
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380 align:start position:0%
so I've read that we've got an invasive
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
species issue that all sorts of insects
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
are coming and plant life what are you
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
doing to deal with those issues I know
 
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:03.660 align:start position:0%
it's a big concern for commissioner
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
Jasper with agriculture but what are you
 
01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:07.980 align:start position:0%
folks doing sure
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
so in your folders that we provided
 
01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:13.799 align:start position:0%
there's a snapshot of our division and
 
01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
the different units that are under uh
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
the force and lands
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
uh one of them is called the Forest
 
01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:20.270 align:start position:0%
uh one of them is called the Forest
Health

01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's actually not officially a bureau
 
01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
but we treat it as such it's Forest
 
01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:26.339 align:start position:0%
Health Program
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
so we have three full-time Professionals
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
in that program
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
and their responsibility is to do
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
monitoring research and mitigation on
 
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
invasive species
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
um the legislature several years ago
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
appropriated a significant amount of
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
funds that funded one of our
 
01:05:44.809 --> 01:05:44.819 align:start position:0%
entomologists on staff to specifically
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
address the invasion of the emerald ash
 
01:05:49.609 --> 01:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
borer I think everyone's pretty familiar
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
with that by now where we we're losing
 
01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:54.299 align:start position:0%
or we'll likely lose most of our mature
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
white ash trees in New Hampshire
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to get into that issue
 
01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
specifically but we have been working on
 
01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
that for a number of years introducing
 
01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
parasitic wasps
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
tiny small in your pinky fingernail that
 
01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
actually feed on the larvae of the the
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
emerald ash borer and so we're releasing
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
and these parasitic wasps are
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
specifically Target they that's what
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
they feed on they're that's the only
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
thing they feed on so even though we're
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
introducing another uh foreign species
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's the first question people ask are
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
we gonna have problems with the WASP but
 
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
what they found the researchers did
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
their full research before they started
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
breeding and distributing these
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
parasitic wasps
 
01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
to basically naturalize and because the
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
animal dashboard is here to stay it's
 
01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
also naturalized so we needed to
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
naturalize a predator and that was the
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
the purpose and this is why we have
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
professional entomologists that study
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
insects bug scientists we call them
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes Pathologists that study tree
 
01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.650 align:start position:0%
sometimes Pathologists that study tree
diseases

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
um and uh you'll be pleased to know in
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
terms of Forest Health that the U.S
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
forest Service has granted us additional
 
01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
funding which is not baked into this
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2425 budget because we're
 
01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
we're asked by the by the budget office
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
by Das not to include it but we'll have
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
another hundred thousand dollars to
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
apply towards Forest health issues in
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24-25 and we've already come
 
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
up with a game plan for that so we we're
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
very actively engaged in in the forest
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
Health invasive species issues
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
all right I I know that there was a wasp
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
that went after gypsy moth I don't know
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
if that was introduced naturally or
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
somebody brought it in but we had that
 
01:07:38.809 --> 01:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
infestation of gypsy moth several years
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
ago and it was developed to go after the
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
eggs or something okay yeah
 
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.410 align:start position:0%
eggs or something okay yeah
um

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about a predator for gypsy
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
moth now that's basically been
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
naturalized for decades and and we've
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
had a spike recently of gypsy moth
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
infestation in the Conway area it's
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
actually a very they've documented this
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
our our staff has they've documented
 
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
where it often is like a band that goes
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
diagonally across the state and kind of
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
tops out in Temple New Hampshire for
 
01:08:07.609 --> 01:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
some reason
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
but um there's a natural fungus that
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
destroys the larvae of the the
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
caterpillar so when we have droughty
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
Summers that fungus is not allowed to
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
spread like it usually does and so we
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
see a spike in the Gypsy moth population
 
01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:27.179 align:start position:0%
after some droughty Summers that's
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
that's what we believe that's what our
 
01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
forest Pathologists believe is occurring
 
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
with gypsy moth right now fortunately
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
they feed mostly on Oak Oak is very
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
resilient and most defeating is done by
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
the end of June
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
an oak can re-sprout a second set of
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
leaves by the end of the summer so but
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
successive defoliations
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
like two to three Summers of heavy
 
01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
defoliation we can lose some trees so
 
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
we're watching that
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
all right any further questions uh
 
01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.390 align:start position:0%
all right any further questions uh
commissioner

01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
great to see you good to see you
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
you know um specifically about Gorham
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
we're about to open a new office in
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
Gorham we um the Department of
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services has uh has had a
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
building there for a number of years
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
they didn't need it anymore and they
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
were going to sell it and we said hold
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
on we would love to have our imprint in
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
Gorham because it is such a critical
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
spot for not only outdoor recreation but
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
a cultural assets too so you'll see an
 
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
invitation this summer for a grand
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
opening of a building that everyone
 
01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
knows in Gorham but I'm really excited
 
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
to expand our visibility and
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
connectivity Beyond Concord and I think
 
01:09:40.849 --> 01:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
but if for our budget discussion when
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
you come back would you put together the
 
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
economic value of our trail system to
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
the state's economy I know it's
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
significant we heard about 160 000
 
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
people use the Salem rail trail and
 
01:09:59.209 --> 01:09:59.219 align:start position:0%
several businesses have developed on the
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
trail so I'd be curious if you could put
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
something together to give us an idea
 
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
exactly what this trail system is
 
01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
providing economically to the states
 
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
probably a big chore but
 
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
you got a couple weeks for you anything
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll get that we'll get it
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
sure representative yeah sorry I'm sorry
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
I came in late
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
on state parks I know you guys really
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
live on fees do you have staffing issues
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
at parks where you could be collecting
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
fees but you don't have the staff to do
 
01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:34.669 align:start position:0%
fees but you don't have the staff to do
it

01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
yeah we make strategic decisions
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
um not every year but as as patterns
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
change and different parks are
 
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
discovered on what the economic
 
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:45.780 align:start position:0%
viability is of having a staff person
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
there or not some of our parks where we
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
don't have a staff person we have an
 
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
iron Ranger where people can leave
 
01:10:54.169 --> 01:10:54.179 align:start position:0%
donations which we collect and um and
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful but yeah it's
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
if we had more stuff we would have more
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
staff at parks that don't have stuff
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
it's a short answer
 
01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
I guess it I I it's probably really hard
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
to quantify but it's one of those things
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
where if you had more staff you could
 
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we you know we're focused
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
um on critical positions like lifeguards
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
you know it would be tragic if we hit
 
01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
the summer season at Hampton Beach and
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't have enough lifeguards we hire
 
01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
73 lifeguards these are very busy people
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine at Hampton Beach so
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
right now we're recruiting those so we
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
put a lot of effort in Recruitment and
 
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:38.340 align:start position:0%
retainment and our primary focus on are
 
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
on some of these Life Safety positions
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then beyond that looking at other
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
other spots that we would love to
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
to hire I while we're talking see how
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is how quick we are there is some
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
um value allocated to Trails Bureau and
 
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
local clubs deliver an additional
 
01:11:59.810 --> 01:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
economic impact of 586 million to the
 
01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
state annually and we estimate the ATV
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
use use generates over another 500
 
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
million in addition third parties
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
generate six million in revenue for
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
their organizations through events held
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
in state parks I will take this number
 
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
and I'll expand a little bit on it for
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
you but we have a start
 
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
thanks so much
 
01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
so it's well after 11 and so we're gonna
 
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
hear from The Liquor Commission are they
 
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.590 align:start position:0%
hear from The Liquor Commission are they
here

01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:12:48.600 --> 01:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
here
okay

01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:14.110 align:start position:0%
 
yeah coupons

01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:17.340 align:start position:0%
and we have some distinguished guests
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.570 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

federal government allowed the states to
 
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
make the choices whether they'd be open
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
or control States and at that time New
 
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire along with 16 other states
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%

employees includes not only the folks at
 
01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:31.219 align:start position:0%
the HQ warehouse but it also includes

our people
 
01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%

and may I ask are are many of those
part-time

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
uh not of that 298 that was their

full-time employees but in General
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
stores have many parts we do yeah and we
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
have a whole section toward the end okay
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
we'll go through the full and part-time
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
and part-time equivalent as well gotcha
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
so on page eight you'll see the
 
01:17:02.810 --> 01:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
statutory uh duties of the Liquor
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
Commission that's uh RSA 176 colon 3
 
01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
opportunities that the Liquor Commission
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
takes forth every day to run a
 
01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
profitable business
 
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
on page nine
 
01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:21.659 align:start position:0%
you look at the division of enforcement
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
they have a pre a three-pronged approach
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
which is Education First enforcement
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
second and Licensing as a third prong of
 
01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
on page 10
 
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side you'll see the
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
2022 calendar year year end we have 6
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
700 and 18 licensees in the United
 
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
States and you can see in the breakdown
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
there so those are folks from across the
 
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
country and here in the states
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
in the state and the revenue below that
 
01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
is derived from the enforcement arm of
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
on page 11
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
on the left hand side you'll see the
 
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
educational efforts of the enforcement
 
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
division the public awareness and
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
education on the left and the licensing
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
educational programs on the right
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
and a breakdown of each and everything
 
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
that we do to make the public aware of
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and the licensees
 
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
trained and as to what we're doing
 
01:18:31.729 --> 01:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
on page 12.
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
you'll see the 2022 I'm sorry there was
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
a question I'm sorry representative
 
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
Griffin sorry representative thank you
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking the
 
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.530 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking the
question

01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I need you to go back to page 10 for
 
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
a minute sure
 
01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
did you say that that number was in
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
state or is that usy that's usy because
 
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
we do allow direct shippers in New
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're one of eight states that
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
allows the shipping of alcohol and wines
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
into the state uh and I'm sorry we're
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
one of eight states that allows the
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
alcohol and wine and there's 13 states
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
that allow wine and beer so as you can
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
see under direct shippers on the third
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
bullet down we have
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
1444 licensees that ship from but these
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
are all New Hampshire licenses no sir
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
these licenses the direct shipper
 
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
licenses are licensees from outside the
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire but but the
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
license allows them to sell things that
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes sir yeah so if they
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
have a website on their liquor store in
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
in Florida we allow them to ship their
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
product here into the state thank you
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
the number look low for us wide thing
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
okay and sure I I was assuming that
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
those were in New Hampshire licenses and
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
allowed people to come in and sell them
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
this thing yes sir thank you for
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
answering thank you representative thank
 
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you just a related
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
question is um I knew that was a long
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
time for wineries is alcohol new to
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
allow people to ship or has that always
 
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
been no alcohol since that direct
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
shipper's license was uh was given out
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
that that's allowed alcohol has been
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
allowed there is some uh
 
01:20:21.239 --> 01:20:24.370 align:start position:0%
allowed there is some uh
some

01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
defined

01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
requirements that allow people to ship
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
they can't sell it into the state less
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
than they can sell it that then we sell
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
it and they can't uh there's a there's a
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
level of how much they can sell from a
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
gallonage standpoint
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
I see so so there's no incentive to buy
 
01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:46.100 align:start position:0%
I Don't Know Jack Daniels or something
 
01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
no via Direct ship instead of in the
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
store right yeah exactly thank you this
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
was put out there for their small
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
boutique wineries across the country
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
especially in California Washington
 
01:20:59.810 --> 01:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
Oregon that may only have an acre of
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
grapes and they may produce three or
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
four hundred cases a year we didn't want
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
we did not want our consumers to not
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
have the availability to those products
 
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
so we allow them to ship them into the
 
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.229 align:start position:0%
so we allow them to ship them into the
stain

01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
stain
 
01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll move on to to uh page 12 and
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
just the 2022 trainings that were done
 
01:21:23.689 --> 01:21:23.699 align:start position:0%
in the state on the left hand side
 
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
you can see the Liquor Commission
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
trained 4 700 people with uh the live
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
classes and in 2022 public awareness
 
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
events there was 67 events held
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
Statewide and we trained just a little
 
01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
over a hundred and thirteen thousand
 
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
people at those
 
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
so education and awareness is a very
 
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
important piece of what the enforcement
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
division does
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
next we can move on to page 13 which is
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
the division of administration and
 
01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:55.010 align:start position:0%
the division of administration and
management

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
you can see that's under our CEO James
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
Vera and and his responsibilities of
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
doit or managed Information Systems
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
Human Resources our HR department and
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
financial financial management which is
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
everything that consumes our
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
transactions of product in the state
 
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
outside of the state and the moving and
 
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
on page 14 you'll see the division of
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
marketing and Merchandising and again on
 
01:22:30.649 --> 01:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
the left hand side their marketing goals
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
by Bullet and on the right hand side the
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that fall under uh Lori
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
Piper who is the director of marketing
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
on page 15
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see the retail outlet locations
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
we have nine state-owned 59 leased and
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
we have 27 Outlets with in-store and
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
curbside pickup some a program that we
 
01:22:59.090 --> 01:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
came up with during covet in September
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
of 2020 and that has garnered the state
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
with 7.6 million dollars in sales since
 
01:23:06.239 --> 01:23:08.450 align:start position:0%
with 7.6 million dollars in sales since
2020.

01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
on page 16 you'll see the state owned
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
only outlets and at the bottom you'll
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
see that those Outlets have brought in
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
just over 164 million dollars and 27 of
 
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
our total sales are done in the
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
locations that we actually own the
 
01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.110 align:start position:0%
locations that we actually own the
property

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
on page 17
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see on the left the top 15 stores
 
01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
of the Liquor Commission bring in 51 of
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
the revenue and all other stores bring
 
01:23:41.630 --> 01:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
in 49 of the revenue with a tally of the
 
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
ranking stores 1 to 15 on the right hand
 
01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:47.990 align:start position:0%
ranking stores 1 to 15 on the right hand
side

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
on page 18 uh just a quick listing of
 
01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
our three agency stores there's one in
 
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
Greenville there's one in Pittsburgh and
 
01:23:58.130 --> 01:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
there's one in Arrow and the revenue
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
that they bring in just a little under
 
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
2.5 million and just a quick note there
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
in the asterisk that arrow is being
 
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
rebuilt at this point because there was
 
01:24:10.729 --> 01:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
a fire two years ago and they should be
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
up and running again by April we're
 
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
being told
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
do have a quick question commissioner I
 
01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:20.699 align:start position:0%
was in Westchester field a couple weeks
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
back with my wife and I noticed large
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
volumes of well there are several Vans
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
loading alcohol in the back there's no
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition to the amount of alcohol you
 
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
can buy at a store right it's not
 
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
unlimited or or cash restricted or
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
anything like that no it's not and we
 
01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
actually had a letter written to us
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
through doj from the IRS that explains
 
01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
that we have no limit of cash and we
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
have no limit of product okay the the
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is not breaking
 
01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
any laws when we sell the product the
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
individual who buys the product when
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
they go back into their state they have
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
to claim the tax in their state but our
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
selling of the product you know as again
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
according to the IRS and according to
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
doj we are breaking no laws and doing
 
01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
that either State and or federal
 
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
question representable
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
um so as far as your retail outlet and
 
01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:20.900 align:start position:0%
state-owned are
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
solidating or are you expanding the
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
number of outlets or have those stayed
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
about the same or just think about
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
Staffing and all that kind of
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
well there's there's and we'll get into
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
some of this and that's fine but there
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
is you know obviously we have a concern
 
01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
of Staffing and we have we have less
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
outlets now than we did 10 years ago but
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
we actually have more square footage so
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
the consolidations have taken the
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
smaller stores and we've opened fewer
 
01:25:53.330 --> 01:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
larger locations mainly to make sure
 
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
that the consumers when they come here
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
they can recognize and purchase the
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
birth of products that we have available
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
because there's very few liquor
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
outlets in the United States that have
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of skews of wine and spirits
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:26:11.229 --> 01:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you so as
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to state-owned that just means
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
you lease in certain places that's
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
so on page 19 you'll look at the web in
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
e-commerce uh just under the orange
 
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
balloon there you can see that we get
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
about 125 000 visitors a month to our
 
01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.830 align:start position:0%
about 125 000 visitors a month to our
website

01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
and we have 200 000 recipients of our
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
monthly email and we gained 25
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
000 additional subscribers in 2022.
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
and on the right hand side again you'll
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
notice that since 2020 the curbside and
 
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
in-store pickup revenue is 7.6 million
 
01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.149 align:start position:0%
in-store pickup revenue is 7.6 million
dollars

01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.450 --> 01:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
on page 20 you'll just see some of the
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
monthly flyers and collaboration
 
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:05.940 align:start position:0%

01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
display work that's been done in our
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%

01:28:29.689 --> 01:28:29.699 align:start position:0%
year alone we opened a new outlet in
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
wrench we opened a new outlet in
 
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester on Gold Street and we opened
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
and just if there's any questions on the
 
01:28:46.450 --> 01:28:46.460 align:start position:0%
bottom uh bullet that's our 95 Hampton
 
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:48.780 align:start position:0%
southbound Northbound and southbound
 
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation we have an appropriation
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
for that the Liquor Commission through
 
01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:58.139 align:start position:0%
statute is allowed to sell that property
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
and redevelop those much like we did in
 
01:29:00.719 --> 01:29:01.850 align:start position:0%
and redevelop those much like we did in
Hooksett

01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
Hooksett
 
01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
hopefully bigger and better
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
on page 23 I'm sorry
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
are you very alert back there sorry so I
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that your locations
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
your rebuilds are very attractive you
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
know they fit into the community and
 
01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
unlike a lot of Steel Buildings you see
 
01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
going up more but I think a lot of
 
01:29:23.209 --> 01:29:23.219 align:start position:0%
people appreciate the overall look of
 
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
the properties thank you representative
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
we tried to give it a New Hampshire
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
Granite Timber Peg and thank you yeah
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah we have a very nice new one a mile
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
from my house so great
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah very convenient
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
um have you increased the minimum size
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
of a of a new location so that you never
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
will build one smaller than x something
 
01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
like that most of the new ones that
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're building are a minimum of around 9
 
01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
000 square feet and obviously running up
 
01:29:56.930 --> 01:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
to 35 000 square feet depending on where
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
the location is we found that 10 11 12
 
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
000 is around the minimum because of the
 
01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:05.219 align:start position:0%
amount of product that we need to fit in
 
01:30:08.090 --> 01:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of skus people when they
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire they come to stock
 
01:30:12.890 --> 01:30:12.900 align:start position:0%
up and that's the goal of people coming
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
here is doing that so we just want to
 
01:30:16.729 --> 01:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
make sure we have a birth of products
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
when they get here so so the overall
 
01:30:21.410 --> 01:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
average there's probably a lot of older
 
01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
stores that are smaller than that nine
 
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
thousand correct yeah so so you're kind
 
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
of pushing in the bigger Direction
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.770 --> 01:30:35.780 align:start position:0%
so you'll see on page 23 the ringe
 
01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
relocation and the sales increase you
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
can see the sales uh the square footage
 
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
increase from 51 100 to 10 000 square
 
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
feet and the 22 percent sales increase
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
in that location since we've moved it in
 
01:30:52.850 --> 01:30:52.860 align:start position:0%
May of 2022.
 
01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
the Concord Outlet which is the new one
 
01:30:58.850 --> 01:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
on exit 17 we went from four thousand
 
01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
square feet over on uh
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
the plaza with Lowe's and Market Basket
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
in downtown
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
we have a minimal increase at this point
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
of two percent but the plaza is not
 
01:31:12.770 --> 01:31:12.780 align:start position:0%
completed yet the Market Basket is now
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
open and we're uh we're looking forward
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
to the restaurants and other uh
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
like-minded retailers that will open
 
01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
like-minded retailers that will open
there

01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
on Manchester and Gold Street uh Number
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
store 31 that's a new location uh
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
year-to-date sales are 3.3 million
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
dollars and obviously right there we're
 
01:31:36.649 --> 01:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
next to the busiest Walmart in New
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
England uh so we're we're generating a
 
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
lot of traffic with between Walmart and
 
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:45.649 align:start position:0%
lot of traffic with between Walmart and
Hannaford

01:31:45.649 --> 01:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.649 --> 01:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
on page 26 you can see the major reason
 
01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
why the the importance of doing what
 
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing building a brand and
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
building larger more impactful stores
 
01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
governor Patrick in 2011 signed a bill
 
01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of liquor licenses
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
that one license he could hold in the
 
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
state of new state of Massachusetts so
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
and they're up to nine in 2020 and
 
01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
there's word that they'll be increasing
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
that again from 9 to 11. uh 50 of our
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
sales uh come from out of state sales so
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales 50 percent of our
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
gross sales number we are now uh in
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
competition with the largest independent
 
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
retailer in the United States which is
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
Total Wine and Spirits they're out of
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
Bethesda Maryland
 
01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
Bethesda Maryland
um

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
on page 27 you can see they have 245
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
stores in 27 States they do about five
 
01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in business they have 11
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
000 employees since 2016 they have built
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
six stores in New Hampshire east of the
 
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
495 belt and they plan on two more in
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
2023 along with Market Basket which is
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
now into a
 
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
MB Liquors they're calling it they have
 
01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
two or three in Maine they have two or
 
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
three in Massachusetts they're opening
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
four more in Massachusetts
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh they're opening two more Costco's and
 
01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
one more BJs in the state
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
so you can see that the big box
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
retailers have come to do business in
 
01:33:21.649 --> 01:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
New England
 
01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
and uh total has stores in Connecticut
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
as well but Massachusetts has kind of
 
01:33:31.250 --> 01:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
put out the welcome sign to alcohol
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
retailers to come and uh
 
01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
generously compete Against The Liquor
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
Commission and quite frankly that's why
 
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
total's here
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
so they're here to do business with us
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
and we're still doing very well
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative McGuire How do prices
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
compare to the consumer here in New
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire compared to these stores
 
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
after tax and all that uh well
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts did a couple of different
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
things when they signed that bill they
 
01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
repealed their alcohol tax at the same
 
01:34:06.229 --> 01:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
time so they were clearly Square on uh
 
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
the target was New Hampshire so they
 
01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
repealed their alcohol tax and they they
 
01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
did give some incentives for people
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
coming to the state our prices are very
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
competitive especially on name brand
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
products Total Wine is a private label
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
retailer so they have knockoff products
 
01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
of pretty much everything that they do
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
across the board so they have a knockoff
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
of Tito's a knockoff of Jack Daniels a
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
knockoff of Kendall Jackson
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
etc etc their marketing plan is to lure
 
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
you in with low prices but they don't
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
have the product there where we'll have
 
01:34:48.410 --> 01:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
six or seven hundred cases of Captain
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
Morgan's in a large tour they'll have
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
six and they may they may match us or
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
undercut by a dollar but the people that
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
go into buy the product the product
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
isn't there to buy and they are making
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
very little on the name brand products
 
01:35:04.129 --> 01:35:04.139 align:start position:0%
we're an outlet we're all about name
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
brand products and their Chardonnay
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's their own private label they have
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
six to twelve labels that come out of
 
01:35:14.689 --> 01:35:14.699 align:start position:0%
one spigot of Chardonnay so they and
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
they do that across the board I mean
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's widely known uh what they do and
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
how they do business in the industry
 
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you now is Total Wine are they a
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%

foreign so you'll see on page
 
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
you'll see on page 28 our hb2 Liquor
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
Commission request in 2011 uh Governor
 
01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.169 align:start position:0%
Commission request in 2011 uh Governor
Lynch

01:35:59.169 --> 01:35:59.179 align:start position:0%
Lynch
 
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
approved and was into hb2 an incentive
 
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
program for the Liquor Commission it's
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
something you know that I've written and
 
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
we never used uh we felt that at this
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
time given the uh paid to S the
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
difference in Pay between what private
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
retailers are paying and what the state
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
is paying that it was time to enact this
 
01:36:26.209 --> 01:36:26.219 align:start position:0%
retail incentive program
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
I did send three or four different
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
um variations of the program to Governor
 
01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
sununu he approved one we are seeing
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
this go into uh hb2 this year and
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
basically the program has approved and
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
has been approved as I said since 2011
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
but the language on page 29 is what
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
we're really looking to see
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
that we're out of the additional profits
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
that are being made the Liquor
 
01:36:56.689 --> 01:36:56.699 align:start position:0%
Commission will fund this program so 10
 
01:36:58.610 --> 01:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
percent of the profits additional
 
01:37:01.930 --> 01:37:01.940 align:start position:0%
profits will be paid to the employees
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
via uh via an incentive bonus so we've
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
broken down it down by the seven areas
 
01:37:12.189 --> 01:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
in the state the seven supervisor areas
 
01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
and at this point we started the program
 
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:19.139 align:start position:0%
in January and we're just looking to
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
have this language put in so we can pay
 
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
foreign McGuire thank you so currently
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
does do any employees work on commission
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
in any way no no representative they
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't and so with this program the more
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
they sell the the better they'll they'll
 
01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
they'll get some kind of a bonus how
 
01:37:48.050 --> 01:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
does that work they anything any
 
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
increase in sales per area so we have
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
seven supervisor areas so if let's say
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
area 7 which is up north increases sales
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
by a million dollars in that area 10 of
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
that increase will go to the employees
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
in that area only to given an incentive
 
01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:13.139 align:start position:0%
so it creates a little competition in
 
01:38:15.370 --> 01:38:15.380 align:start position:0%
the stores and it also increases
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
employees salaries we
 
01:38:21.530 --> 01:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
and I just have to be frank our our
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
employees in our retail outlets are
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
grossly underpaid compared to private
 
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
retailers in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
I mean McDonald's in Claremont the other
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
day when I went by was 18 an hour a free
 
01:38:39.050 --> 01:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
meal with each shift twenty five hundred
 
01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
dollar incentive for Education uh work
 
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
today get paid tomorrow so we're way
 
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
behind the we're behind the eight ball
 
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
on that and we're just trying to let our
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
employees know that we we recognize it
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
we understand it we're concerned about
 
01:38:57.169 --> 01:38:57.179 align:start position:0%
it and we're doing something about it
 
01:38:59.810 --> 01:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
how about in the benefits area I think
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
the benefits are are as far as part-time
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
employees we have no benefits for our
 
01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:06.659 align:start position:0%
part-time employees our full-time
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
employees are are well taken care of and
 
01:39:13.090 --> 01:39:13.100 align:start position:0%
in my humble opinion okay
 
01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:16.460 align:start position:0%
the part-time rate starting rate is
 
01:39:20.090 --> 01:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
12.63 cents an hour I see yeah yeah
 
01:39:23.689 --> 01:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
that's not great and so so this
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
incentive is kind of a team concept
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
rather than you sell you do something
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
for personal that's correct or even buy
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
a store no right it's from top to bottom
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
any employee be it full-time or
 
01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
part-time that works more than 21 hours
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
a week 21 hours a week will be involved
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
in the incentive program and one of the
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
things that Tina will get into is what
 
01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
we've seen over the years our part-time
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
employees used to bump up against that
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
28-hour window all the time our
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
part-time employees are now working 15
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
hours or a week or less so we need to
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
incentivize them to make us their
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
primary part-time employer so if they
 
01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
are working for three different people
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'll take that extra shift a week at the
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
liquor admission to get to my 21 hours
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
so I can enjoy part of that bonus right
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:23.689 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

01:40:23.689 --> 01:40:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:26.810 --> 01:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so at this point thank
 
01:40:29.689 --> 01:40:29.699 align:start position:0%
you very much for your questions uh I'll
 
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Tina to take you through
 
01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of the program
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
so on page 30 what we have is our full
 
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
time and our part-time positions so
 
01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the upper left corner it's
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
our authorized full-time positions both
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
filled and vacant with our vacancy rate
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that this year to date we
 
01:40:55.129 --> 01:40:55.139 align:start position:0%
have the her highest vacancy rate at 12
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
percent we're currently recruiting for
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
40 positions with the majority of those
 
01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
positions being in the stores
 
01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:05.719 align:start position:0%
full time yeah the second chart is
 
01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent based on part-time
 
01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
hours worked and as you can see we are
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
down to 285 full-time equivalent
 
01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:18.659 align:start position:0%
so for a comparison in 21 we were when
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
we had record sales year we had 312
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
filled full-time positions and 358
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
part-time full-time equivalent for a
 
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
total of 670 full-time equivalent
 
01:41:34.370 --> 01:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
currently we have 303 filled full-time
 
01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
positions and 285 part-time full-time
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
equivalent for a total of 588 full-time
 
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
equivalent which is a difference of 82
 
01:41:45.290 --> 01:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
full-time equivalent and this reduction
 
01:41:47.390 --> 01:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
in position is the reason why you know
 
01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
store hours have been reduced why we've
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
had to close doors and sales have been
 
01:41:53.689 --> 01:41:53.699 align:start position:0%
impacted because we don't have the
 
01:41:53.699 --> 01:41:55.430 align:start position:0%
impacted because we don't have the
people

01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
um historically the outlets have been
 
01:41:59.570 --> 01:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
supported by a fairly even mix of
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
full-time and part-time staff however
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
with the current trend of part-timers
 
01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
working the less hours we found the need
 
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
to request additional full-time
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
positions in our 24-25 budget to offset
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
so on page 31
 
01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
this is our sales expense and revenue
 
01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
trends for FY 20 to 22 and then the
 
01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:31.139 align:start position:0%
estimates for 23 24 and 25 as we've
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
provided in our budget request
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
this is just to show how our budget
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
supports our sales and our revenues
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
and there are two rsas that are listed
 
01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:43.820 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of the page the first
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
transfer requirement is under RSA 17616
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
and this is calculated into our plan
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
since it's the five percent of our prior
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
Year's gross profit and this is
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
identified online 7 in the table
 
01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
and then there's RSA 126 AAA colon 3 and
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
this is not in our Revenue plan because
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's the additional funds requested by
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
HHS and that's line 9 on the table
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
and as identified as the granted
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
Advantage the monthly Revenue Focus
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
produced by Das reports the actual
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
transfer that's on line 10 but this is
 
01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:23.219 align:start position:0%
not a true comparison to our plan
 
01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
because they do it at the reduction of
 
01:43:30.470 --> 01:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
the additional funds transferred to HHS
 
01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
we also think it's important to mention
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
that we are on target for this year's
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue plan which is notable in this
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
ever-changing and unpredictable National
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
economy especially since the current
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
year plan was created two years ago
 
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
so we'll move on to page 32 for our
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
so there are three main Revenue
 
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
categories that are listed and on slide
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
33 there's a chart that has a five-year
 
01:44:00.239 --> 01:44:01.310 align:start position:0%
33 there's a chart that has a five-year
history

01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
the categories are beer tax and permits
 
01:44:06.649 --> 01:44:06.659 align:start position:0%
which is 30 cents a gallon sold on or
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
transferred for retail sales or to the
 
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
public for authorized licensees
 
01:44:14.209 --> 01:44:14.219 align:start position:0%
liquor and wine Revenue this is the sale
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
of wine and spirits and accessories
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
through our outlets and our warehouses
 
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
to retail customers and on-premise
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
licensees which are restaurants and
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
lounges and off-premise licensees which
 
01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
are the grocery stores and the
 
01:44:27.410 --> 01:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
convenience stores
 
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
and then we have another Revenue source
 
01:44:31.729 --> 01:44:31.739 align:start position:0%
which is primarily the licensing fees
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
but it also includes the direct shipping
 
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:35.580 align:start position:0%
permits and Lottery and other
 
01:44:39.530 --> 01:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.290 --> 01:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
so moving on to page 34
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
this is a chart of the five-year history
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
of Revenue and expenses
 
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
and the line in the middle is the net
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
revenue transferred annually
 
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
we've gone from 157.4 million in 2018 to
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
165.4 million in FY 22.
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
and our operating expense ratio is
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.410 --> 01:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
on page 35 is the budget broken down by
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
division for FY 22 and our FY 23
 
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized and then the FY 24
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
and 25 budget requests and as you can
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
see marketing and Merchandising which
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
includes the outlets is the majority of
 
01:45:29.209 --> 01:45:29.219 align:start position:0%
our budget and then next you have
 
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
Finance Enforcement office of the
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
commission and then workers comp and
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
on page 36 is a graft of the five-year
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
transfer history and the estimates for
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
23 to 25 and broken down by the two rsas
 
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
governing our Revenue transfers first
 
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
you'll see is the alcohol fund started
 
01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
out at 6.8 million in 18 and uh
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
increased to 11.5 million for FY 23
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
which we've already transferred and then
 
01:46:07.970 --> 01:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
you have the next which is the granted
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
advantage that started in fy21 it was
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
8.2 million and this year we've already
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
transferred 7.2 million
 
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
then the next is the beer tax which is
 
01:46:21.290 --> 01:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
consistent around the 13 million and the
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
last is the remaining net revenue from
 
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
and then on slide 37 representative I'm
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
sorry quick question
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
sure so there's a
 
01:46:41.570 --> 01:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
a wine or
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
no they they purchase it from us through
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
the warehouse
 
01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:48.950 align:start position:0%
the warehouse
oh

01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
the tests on beer representative is a
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
gallonage tax so manuf from from the
 
01:46:54.119 --> 01:46:58.669 align:start position:0%
gallonage tax so manuf from from the
distributors

01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
and then on page 37 is our FY 22 sales
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
broken down by customer and category
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
type so Spirits wine and accessories and
 
01:47:09.410 --> 01:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
this is just so you can see where our
 
01:47:10.729 --> 01:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
sales come from
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
our retail sale Spirits were three 383
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
million or 50 percent of our business
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
retail wine 173 million or 22.6 percent
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
of our business and in total retail
 
01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
accounts for 72.7 percent of our
 
01:47:27.530 --> 01:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
business and then you can see the
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
breakdown for the other categories on
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
the pie charts
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
and a quick question sure going back I
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
think ringe had what 22 percent increase
 
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
in sales so it led me to start thinking
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
is it better for you I know it's
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
probably a too broad a question but to
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
own the stores or to lease stores what's
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
been your historical find as far as
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
owning versus leasing well originally uh
 
01:47:56.410 --> 01:47:56.420 align:start position:0%
when I first started at the commission
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
and to this day we would need to get an
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
appropriation to build we'd have to
 
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
borrow the money we'd have to bond the
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
money and with the cost of materials and
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
equipment today were clearly better
 
01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
leasing than we are building because of
 
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
the costs of of of anything a two by
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
four or a wiring anything that has to do
 
01:48:19.850 --> 01:48:19.860 align:start position:0%
with building components is ridiculous
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we've done
 
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
over the years is our outlay of cash in
 
01:48:28.609 --> 01:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
a lease proposition is is very minimal
 
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
because we partner with our land Lords
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the first 10 years of the lease so a
 
01:48:36.530 --> 01:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
lease with Market Basket Brix Moore or
 
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
whoever our our landlord is we go to
 
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
them and say this is what it costs us to
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
build this bill this is what it will
 
01:48:48.109 --> 01:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
cost us to build this building
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to add that cost into the
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
additional square footage for the first
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
10 years of the lease so our outlay is
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
mint zero to minimal and it's spread out
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
over the first 10 years of the lease and
 
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
then drops off so not only do we get a
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
favorable rate from landlords because
 
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
we're the driver of traffic into the
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
plaza we're not having the outlay of of
 
01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
State cash hurting State coffers we're
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
paying for between 350 and 550 an
 
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
additional square footage for the first
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
10 years and then that drops off most of
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
the leases at this point are 20 to 25
 
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
year leases and we found that that's the
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
best way to do it for us because it
 
01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
keeps our cash flowing for the business
 
01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
we don't need an appropriation we don't
 
01:49:42.250 --> 01:49:42.260 align:start position:0%
have to pay the bonding and interest
 
01:49:47.570 --> 01:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative hatch so the 350 550 is
 
01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:51.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
that's the additional dollars per square
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
foot that will be for the first 10 years
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
of the lease representative all right
 
01:50:00.890 --> 01:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
you used to pay me like five dollars a
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
square foot up in Berlin years ago but
 
01:50:06.010 --> 01:50:06.020 align:start position:0%
that was pathetic
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
I threw me out after that I
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
I guess I just never thought of it this
 
01:50:19.609 --> 01:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
way so like a Hannaford's or a Market
 
01:50:22.129 --> 01:50:22.139 align:start position:0%
Basket if they're selling wine since you
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
folks are the ones that sell wine in the
 
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
state they're buying their wine from you
 
01:50:30.410 --> 01:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
correct we are the in in the state of
 
01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we are the retailer on our
 
01:50:35.890 --> 01:50:35.900 align:start position:0%
end but we're also the wholesaler to
 
01:50:38.209 --> 01:50:38.219 align:start position:0%
licensees on premise which is
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants and lounges and and any and
 
01:50:44.090 --> 01:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
anybody else that has that type of
 
01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
license and then we are the wholesaler
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
to uh the on off-premise licensees which
 
01:50:54.530 --> 01:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
are the market baskets Hannaford's Shaws

Etc they buy our product from them they
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
buy our product from us and every month
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
we came out we come out with a special
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
flyer of deals for them to buy in so
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
when we get a a great price on something
 
01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%

01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:33.179 align:start position:0%
you sell it in your store for one price
 
01:51:37.129 --> 01:51:37.139 align:start position:0%
you sell it to the to the um off-premise
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
for another price and to the on-premise
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
for some other price right well the the
 
01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
prices are relatively close and what we
 
01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
found and what is beneficial to our
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
business partners is when someone is at
 
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
their store and they're doing their
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
grocery shopping it's the convenience so
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
if they're there and they need one
 
01:51:56.930 --> 01:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
bottle of wine they'll buy that one
 
01:51:59.149 --> 01:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
bottle and pay the dollar more rather
 
01:52:01.370 --> 01:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
than you know go into another store if
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
if we find the consumers if they're not
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
going to bulk buy uh they they tend to
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
pick up while they're shopping if it's
 
01:52:11.570 --> 01:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
just one bottle so our goal is to get
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.290 --> 01:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
if you only have to drive a mile we have
 
01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
better prices yeah
 
01:52:26.330 --> 01:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
okay so but
 
01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
I guess my point was do you sell to
 
01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:30.890 align:start position:0%
I guess my point was do you sell to
Hannaford

01:52:30.890 --> 01:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
Hannaford
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
less per bottle than you sell to the
 
01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:34.910 align:start position:0%
less per bottle than you sell to the
consumer

01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:52:36.770 --> 01:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
or is it all the same it's all the same
 
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
and actually the licensees get a 10
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
discount if they buy through the
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
warehouse as well so a licensee a
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
restaurant they can they can either have
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
the product shipped to them and pay for
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
the shipping or they can pick it up in
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
Bow which hundreds of licensees do and
 
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
get the 10 discount off of off of the
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
shelf or they can go into the stores and
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
take advantage of our sales which a lot
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
of licensees do smaller license these do
 
01:53:05.450 --> 01:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
as well great thank you very much you're
 
01:53:05.460 --> 01:53:06.950 align:start position:0%
as well great thank you very much you're
welcome

01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
so we'll just see on page 38 that we've
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
contributed uh 3.5 million with
 
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
non-profits across the state just
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
briefly and we we partner with our
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
suppliers worldwide national suppliers
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
and local Brokers to make those
 
01:53:28.129 --> 01:53:28.139 align:start position:0%
donations and then on page 39 and 40 and
 
01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
41 just some of the awards that the
 
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission has won and some of
 
01:53:34.729 --> 01:53:34.739 align:start position:0%
the accolades we've been given locally
 
01:53:37.729 --> 01:53:37.739 align:start position:0%
and nationally we're very we have a very
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
competitive team and we're very grateful
 
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
for the recognition uh
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
that people like what we're doing so
 
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
we're very grateful for that
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you are
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
there any further questions for the
 
01:53:53.810 --> 01:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission representative McGuire
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
yep let me ask about is there any sort
 
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
of substitution effect between liquor
 
01:54:02.810 --> 01:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
and marijuana because all of our
 
01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
surrounding states now have
 
01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:07.450 align:start position:0%
surrounding states now have
um

01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:07.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana we don't right
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
have sales dropped in some way because
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
when that started
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh no but in in monitoring those sales
 
01:54:22.490 --> 01:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
what we notice is much like people from
 
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
out of state come to New Hampshire to
 
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
buy their liquor
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
people from New Hampshire are going to
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont and Massachusetts to buy
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
their cannabis products so in our
 
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
research uh those are the the New
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license plates are in the
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
three states that are surrounding us it
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
has not we have not seen an effect on
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales per se but we have
 
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
recognized that consumers of cannabis in
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are visiting other states
 
01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
to buy their product
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
so therefore you think if New Hampshire
 
01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
joined these other states as far as
 
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
cannabis goes
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
you don't think your business would be
 
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
affected very much
 
01:55:06.350 --> 01:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
well I certainly think if we had those
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
consumers if we took the same model with
 
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
alcohol with cannabis that we do with
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
alcohol and we were hyper competitive
 
01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
and or better priced I think that we
 
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
would drive some of those consumers that
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
come here to buy alcohol to buy cannabis
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
while they were here obviously we always
 
01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
what are consumers doing when they're
 
01:55:32.050 --> 01:55:32.060 align:start position:0%
here they're coming to recreate
 
01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
four-wheeling the ocean the mountains so
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
they're buying gas they're paying rooms
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
and meals tax they're helping all our
 
01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
small businesses by you know renting and
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
doing what they're doing so I think
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
there'd be some bleed over uh
 
01:55:49.550 --> 01:55:49.560 align:start position:0%
positive bleed over to the state of New
 
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right just from a business
 
01:55:54.370 --> 01:55:54.380 align:start position:0%
standpoint I understand thank you
 
01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions I
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
will recognize sitting in the back there
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
Lou dalessandro Senator dalessandro and
 
01:56:03.770 --> 01:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
his wife keeping an eye on us
 
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
commissioner I'm sure we don't pick on
 
01:56:08.450 --> 01:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission I believe anyway
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%

03:05:54.110 --> 03:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
so hi uh good afternoon Taylor Caswell
 
03:05:55.429 --> 03:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Department of Business
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
and economic Affairs this is Larry
 
03:05:58.969 --> 03:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
harnois who is the state tourism
 
03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
director uh who is here to talk I think
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit about that angle of what we
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
do at Bea
 
03:06:08.269 --> 03:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
um thank you for having us today I think
 
03:06:10.190 --> 03:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's a good opportunity to just sort of
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of a reset on uh Bea and
 
03:06:16.010 --> 03:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
kind of where we are and uh in terms of
 
03:06:17.929 --> 03:06:17.939 align:start position:0%
organization and budget and structure
 
03:06:19.849 --> 03:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
and strategies for a few minutes and
 
03:06:21.410 --> 03:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
then sort of see what you want to talk
 
03:06:22.910 --> 03:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
about but
 
03:06:24.710 --> 03:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
um we're still I guess in the world of
 
03:06:27.469 --> 03:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
of uh state government relatively new uh
 
03:06:29.870 --> 03:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
five years 2017 is when Bea was
 
03:06:34.849 --> 03:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
established it was uh it is a uh two of
 
03:06:36.650 --> 03:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
the major divisions that previously were
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
at what we used to call dread Department
 
03:06:40.969 --> 03:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
of resource and economic development
 
03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
that came over and formed the business
 
03:06:45.230 --> 03:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Business and economic
 
03:06:46.490 --> 03:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
Affairs and then we also have the
 
03:06:47.809 --> 03:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
03:06:50.210 --> 03:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
resources so the two of those were the
 
03:06:52.429 --> 03:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
outgrowths of that I've been the
 
03:06:53.929 --> 03:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department since
 
03:06:57.410 --> 03:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's since it began in 2017.
 
03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
um and our mission really is uh to to
 
03:07:02.090 --> 03:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
Steward the state economy and the
 
03:07:03.290 --> 03:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
quality of life I mean that's really
 
03:07:06.469 --> 03:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
what we bury it we boil it down to uh
 
03:07:08.510 --> 03:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
with our different organizations and
 
03:07:10.370 --> 03:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
divisions within the department and I
 
03:07:11.690 --> 03:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
can get into a little bit about how we
 
03:07:13.730 --> 03:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
do that
 
03:07:16.370 --> 03:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
uh so as far as our hierarchy goes we
 
03:07:18.230 --> 03:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
have a number of different offices two
 
03:07:20.090 --> 03:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
major divisions the division of Economic
 
03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
Development and the division of travel

uh I don't know off the top of my head
 
03:10:43.969 --> 03:10:43.979 align:start position:0%
but there's probably about seven or
 
03:10:45.710 --> 03:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
eight staff here in Concord plus we have
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%

03:11:07.849 --> 03:11:07.859 align:start position:0%

call the office of strategic initiatives
 
03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:11.330 align:start position:0%

03:11:12.410 --> 03:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
um the office of Planning and
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%

03:11:17.150 --> 03:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
and we've been happy to have them we
 
03:11:19.490 --> 03:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
have our office of outdoor recreation
 
03:11:21.830 --> 03:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
and Industry development this is another
 
03:11:23.809 --> 03:11:23.819 align:start position:0%
federally funded program that gives us
 
03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to connect the dots on
 
03:11:28.010 --> 03:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
economic development and outdoor
 
03:11:30.889 --> 03:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
recreation and tourism
 
03:11:34.130 --> 03:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
um travel and tourism is uh really one
 
03:11:35.809 --> 03:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
of the major functions of the department
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let Lori talk about that in
 
03:11:38.929 --> 03:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
just a minute but
 
03:11:40.849 --> 03:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
um the division of travel tourism
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
development is the marketing engine of
 
03:11:44.750 --> 03:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
the state the marketing engine for
 
03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:46.309 align:start position:0%
the state the marketing engine for
tourism

03:11:46.309 --> 03:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I guess we get some of the nice
 
03:11:50.330 --> 03:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
pictures that are in some and in your uh
 
03:11:52.910 --> 03:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
handout today that come from that but
 
03:11:54.830 --> 03:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
also I've just been seeing some very
 
03:11:56.929 --> 03:11:56.939 align:start position:0%
significant results uh for the
 
03:11:58.370 --> 03:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
Investments that we make into that and
 
03:12:00.110 --> 03:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
again I'll let Lori expand on that a
 
03:12:01.490 --> 03:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
little bit in a moment
 
03:12:03.469 --> 03:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
are there any questions so far
 
03:12:05.210 --> 03:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
representative Abel sorry I went through
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
so under arpa we have to have the funds
 
03:12:19.490 --> 03:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
obligated by the end of 2024 and then we
 
03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
have to have those funds uh fully
 
03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:29.450 --> 03:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
so that would be
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
as uh in relation to the invest in each
 
03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
housing program
 
03:12:37.490 --> 03:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
the programs that we are now funding for
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
Housing Development have 18-month
 
03:12:44.590 --> 03:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:47.929 --> 03:12:47.939 align:start position:0%
sure you said for the housing you had a
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
hundred million but I didn't hear you
 
03:12:52.910 --> 03:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
say a number for the Broadband yeah so
 
03:12:54.769 --> 03:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
the so we're getting we have different
 
03:12:56.570 --> 03:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
sources under Broadband some of which we
 
03:12:58.849 --> 03:12:58.859 align:start position:0%
haven't got the funding yet so we don't
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
know what the total is but to date we uh
 
03:13:04.429 --> 03:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
we have under the the old care the
 
03:13:07.190 --> 03:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
capital projects fund under arpa the
 
03:13:09.830 --> 03:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
number is 122 million dollars for that
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
program we expect probably at least that
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
much when we get the infrastructure uh
 
03:13:17.809 --> 03:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
funding under What's called the bead
 
03:13:20.090 --> 03:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
program which we expect to see later
 
03:13:22.070 --> 03:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
this year maybe this summer from the
 
03:13:25.550 --> 03:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:27.889 --> 03:13:27.899 align:start position:0%

Broadband connect program so this is a
 
03:13:44.450 --> 03:13:44.460 align:start position:0%

03:14:14.929 --> 03:14:14.939 align:start position:0%
responsible for and that they put in
 
03:14:18.170 --> 03:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
their uh application so that will total
 
03:14:21.530 --> 03:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's I recall is around 23
 
03:14:23.809 --> 03:14:23.819 align:start position:0%
000 new unserved and underserved
 
03:14:26.269 --> 03:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
locations and that's all where they are
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
and all that is all on our website if
 
03:14:29.210 --> 03:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see the list I can
 
03:14:31.010 --> 03:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
certainly get it for you we're going to
 
03:14:34.010 --> 03:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
be issuing at we expect to have at the
 
03:14:36.769 --> 03:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
next executive council meeting the uh
 
03:14:39.410 --> 03:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
the award for the second round of this
 
03:14:42.050 --> 03:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
program and that we expect to be
 
03:14:44.690 --> 03:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
somewhere near that number or another 20
 
03:14:46.730 --> 03:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
000 unserved and underserved locations
 
03:14:49.370 --> 03:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
primarily in rural areas in the state in
 
03:14:51.889 --> 03:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
the northwest of Concord so once a
 
03:14:51.899 --> 03:14:53.269 align:start position:0%
the northwest of Concord so once a
customer

03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
customer
 
03:14:55.969 --> 03:14:55.979 align:start position:0%
um you signs up for the service they
 
03:14:59.210 --> 03:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
would still pay their fees similar to
 
03:15:01.849 --> 03:15:01.859 align:start position:0%
what a customer in Manchester or
 
03:15:03.469 --> 03:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
somebody else somewhere else would pay
 
03:15:05.389 --> 03:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
is that right that would be how it would
 
03:15:06.950 --> 03:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
it would work right I mean you get
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
hooked up and you have that accessed if
 
03:15:10.250 --> 03:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
you want to have that internet speed
 
03:15:13.070 --> 03:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
yeah you pay the same price gotcha thank
 
03:15:13.080 --> 03:15:14.389 align:start position:0%
yeah you pay the same price gotcha thank
you

03:15:14.389 --> 03:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:22.370 --> 03:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good to see you
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
areas of concern are continuing concern
 
03:15:29.769 --> 03:15:29.779 align:start position:0%
is our
 
03:15:31.630 --> 03:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
visitor Services
 
03:15:34.490 --> 03:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
i.e.r rest areas
 
03:15:34.500 --> 03:15:35.990 align:start position:0%
i.e.r rest areas
um

03:15:35.990 --> 03:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:40.370 --> 03:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
to get together something that would
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
inform us what you need to have them
 
03:15:48.650 --> 03:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
open with more frequency than we
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
currently experience
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
um it's just um
 
03:15:55.730 --> 03:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
in my mind a little bit aggravating
 
03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
driving up the interstate whether it be
 
03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
89 or 93 and having our rest areas
 
03:16:03.359 --> 03:16:04.870 align:start position:0%
89 or 93 and having our rest areas
closed

03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
closed
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
just leaves a very poor impression for
 
03:16:13.550 --> 03:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
our visitors I'm sure and um
 
03:16:16.190 --> 03:16:16.200 align:start position:0%
and in here Bureau of visitor Services
 
03:16:18.469 --> 03:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
provides visitors with necessary and
 
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
requested information is enhance the
 
03:16:24.170 --> 03:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
visitors guest experience
 
03:16:27.950 --> 03:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
um and it ensures uh what visiting
 
03:16:31.550 --> 03:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
centers are welcoming uh closed is not
 
03:16:33.950 --> 03:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
very welcoming yeah so what can we do to
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
address that it's been an ongoing issue
 
03:16:38.570 --> 03:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
with me it drives me nuts we're a state
 
03:16:42.650 --> 03:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
that relies heavily on tourism and um I
 
03:16:43.849 --> 03:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
would think we'd be able to do a little
 
03:16:46.250 --> 03:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
bit of job in that area well I share
 
03:16:47.809 --> 03:16:47.819 align:start position:0%
your frustration I think the major
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
problem is that we pay twelve dollars an
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
hour for people to sit in those vest
 
03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
areas and maintain them and clean the
 
03:16:55.250 --> 03:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and mow The Lawns that sort of
 
03:16:56.690 --> 03:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
thing and it's not anywhere near what
 
03:16:59.870 --> 03:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
the market pays for those we have most
 
03:17:03.110 --> 03:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the services in this in the rest
 
03:17:06.530 --> 03:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
areas that are open are on our borders
 
03:17:09.650 --> 03:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh primarily where we focus those we
 
03:17:11.690 --> 03:17:11.700 align:start position:0%
have only one area that has had a
 
03:17:16.010 --> 03:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
difficult time staying open at all in on
 
03:17:16.020 --> 03:17:17.389 align:start position:0%
difficult time staying open at all in on
89

03:17:17.389 --> 03:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
89
 
03:17:20.510 --> 03:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
um which one is it that's Sutton Sutton
 
03:17:22.730 --> 03:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
has been a difficult one but we have uh
 
03:17:25.370 --> 03:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
you know we just hired someone buddy to
 
03:17:27.650 --> 03:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
work at the Seabrook Center and she
 
03:17:30.230 --> 03:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
lives in Concord so they're willing to
 
03:17:31.849 --> 03:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
make for whatever reason she's willing
 
03:17:33.410 --> 03:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
to make that drive over to the Seabrook
 
03:17:36.710 --> 03:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
rest area but we are particularly in
 
03:17:39.530 --> 03:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
places like Colebrook and Littleton
 
03:17:42.290 --> 03:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
um we are subject to having staff so if
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the staff to be there
 
03:17:47.690 --> 03:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
on a given day then that obviously
 
03:17:49.910 --> 03:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
impacts our operational capabilities but
 
03:17:52.610 --> 03:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
that you know speaking for Bob Vashon
 
03:17:55.269 --> 03:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
who is the chief of this of this Bureau
 
03:17:57.650 --> 03:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
he would very much share your
 
03:17:59.530 --> 03:17:59.540 align:start position:0%
frustration he is very
 
03:18:02.450 --> 03:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
inclined to have these operations be
 
03:18:05.389 --> 03:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
what they are expected to be I think
 
03:18:07.969 --> 03:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
given the circumstances and given the
 
03:18:09.650 --> 03:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
labor market
 
03:18:12.050 --> 03:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
um he's done a good job at keeping the
 
03:18:14.570 --> 03:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
key ones available and open where you
 
03:18:16.190 --> 03:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
know in the 93 quarters in the mass
 
03:18:18.769 --> 03:18:18.779 align:start position:0%
where we see the most people but it is
 
03:18:21.710 --> 03:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
you know quite simply a a question of
 
03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:22.910 align:start position:0%
you know quite simply a a question of
Workforce

03:18:22.910 --> 03:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is is what do we
 
03:18:27.889 --> 03:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
need to do to change those circumstances
 
03:18:30.410 --> 03:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
what do we need to do to assure that
 
03:18:32.690 --> 03:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
there's adequate Personnel to have these
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
visitor centers open I you probably
 
03:18:38.389 --> 03:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
would be maybe not amazed at how many
 
03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
comments I get from individuals about
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm still hearing about the one in
 
03:18:46.010 --> 03:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
Shelburne closing
 
03:18:47.690 --> 03:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
way too often
 
03:18:51.469 --> 03:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
um and um I see I and I think it's a
 
03:18:52.969 --> 03:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
serious issue and I think it needs to be
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
addressed so to say the problem is we
 
03:18:56.990 --> 03:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
only paid twelve dollars an hour that
 
03:18:59.870 --> 03:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't answer my word my query is what
 
03:19:01.849 --> 03:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
do you need
 
03:19:05.150 --> 03:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
from us to address that issue and assure
 
03:19:07.849 --> 03:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
that we have adequate personnel there to
 
03:19:10.670 --> 03:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
maintain them and have an open
 
03:19:12.889 --> 03:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
um when visitors might expect them to be
 
03:19:15.170 --> 03:19:15.180 align:start position:0%
and when they could provide the service
 
03:19:18.889 --> 03:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
that is important for to maintain the
 
03:19:18.899 --> 03:19:20.389 align:start position:0%
that is important for to maintain the
visitor

03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
visitor
 
03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
we have everything we need to operate
 
03:19:25.130 --> 03:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
the centers except the people and and
 
03:19:26.650 --> 03:19:26.660 align:start position:0%
that is not a cons it's it's
 
03:19:30.110 --> 03:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
inconsistent I would say in the uh in
 
03:19:31.730 --> 03:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
the main travel corridors we haven't had
 
03:19:33.650 --> 03:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
as much of difficulty in getting those
 
03:19:35.690 --> 03:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
staffed and it is as a result sometimes
 
03:19:37.849 --> 03:19:37.859 align:start position:0%
of asking people to travel quite a
 
03:19:39.110 --> 03:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
distance to be able to staff those
 
03:19:39.120 --> 03:19:40.670 align:start position:0%
distance to be able to staff those
centers

03:19:40.670 --> 03:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
centers
 
03:19:43.610 --> 03:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
um but it does in some other areas put
 
03:19:46.550 --> 03:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
us in a position of being unable to stay
 
03:19:49.250 --> 03:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
open at seven days that that we're all
 
03:19:51.530 --> 03:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
hoping to be able to be open well I just
 
03:19:52.730 --> 03:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
need to know
 
03:19:55.309 --> 03:19:55.319 align:start position:0%
again what you need
 
03:19:57.230 --> 03:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
so that we can have adequate personnel
 
03:20:00.050 --> 03:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
there to have them open if it's we need
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
more money to pay adequate salary to
 
03:20:04.969 --> 03:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
those individuals to attract them to
 
03:20:07.610 --> 03:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
that job that's what you need
 
03:20:09.769 --> 03:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple other things there's
 
03:20:11.150 --> 03:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I think I brought it to your
 
03:20:12.889 --> 03:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
attention before a few years ago the
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
csep program and things like that where
 
03:20:18.530 --> 03:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
you can get help for next to nothing and
 
03:20:21.889 --> 03:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh nothing in their elderly
 
03:20:25.250 --> 03:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
but they are very reliable uh and and
 
03:20:27.650 --> 03:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
good people to have on board
 
03:20:27.660 --> 03:20:28.550 align:start position:0%
good people to have on board
um

03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:31.250 --> 03:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
and I I think we need to pay a little
 
03:20:33.469 --> 03:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
more attention there and I just need to
 
03:20:35.570 --> 03:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
know what you need if you if we have to
 
03:20:38.570 --> 03:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
pay them 900 an hour what that would
 
03:20:38.580 --> 03:20:39.910 align:start position:0%
pay them 900 an hour what that would
take

03:20:39.910 --> 03:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:20:44.030 --> 03:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm being extreme yeah that's that's to
 
03:20:46.130 --> 03:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
make my point yeah and I understand
 
03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative we've talked about this
 
03:20:50.330 --> 03:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
you know over the years I I it is very
 
03:20:52.309 --> 03:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
much a frustration and a challenge I
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's all that different than
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of other businesses that I talk to
 
03:20:57.530 --> 03:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis that can't staff
 
03:20:59.090 --> 03:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
their manufacturing facilities their
 
03:21:01.730 --> 03:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
health care facilities I know we have we
 
03:21:03.290 --> 03:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
have a real labor shortage in the state
 
03:21:05.990 --> 03:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
and these jobs unfortunately are at a
 
03:21:07.670 --> 03:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
point sort of within that income
 
03:21:10.070 --> 03:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
category that's near the bottom if
 
03:21:12.530 --> 03:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
you're not working for us at 12 or 13 an
 
03:21:14.269 --> 03:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
hour you can work at Dunkin Donuts for
 
03:21:17.630 --> 03:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
15 or 16. so we're we're in a
 
03:21:19.130 --> 03:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
competition I'm aware of all that yeah I
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
know so again back to my question I want
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
you to ask me what I asked you so we
 
03:21:25.730 --> 03:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
have a clear understanding what what I
 
03:21:27.769 --> 03:21:27.779 align:start position:0%
need to know from you
 
03:21:31.250 --> 03:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
so you so if I could I guess I'm it's
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
probably frustrated as representative
 
03:21:36.590 --> 03:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
hatch do you need to pay 15 an hour I
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
think that's what he's trying to get out
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
of you to you need to pay 15 or 16 an
 
03:21:41.690 --> 03:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
hour we just heard from The Liquor
 
03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
Commission that has an incentive program
 
03:21:45.889 --> 03:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
because they're having trouble to get
 
03:21:47.870 --> 03:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
people in so they're going to put some
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
incentive programs together uh I've
 
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
heard some from some of my friends uh
 
03:21:56.210 --> 03:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
female friends say they're disgusted to
 
03:21:59.090 --> 03:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
go to these rest areas and use the
 
03:22:01.730 --> 03:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
facilities and you go and I do a lot of
 
03:22:04.130 --> 03:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
traveling around New England Maine New
 
03:22:06.349 --> 03:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
York Vermont they have beautiful rest
 
03:22:08.990 --> 03:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
areas and they're staffed so they're
 
03:22:11.210 --> 03:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
often staffed by private sector so the
 
03:22:12.590 --> 03:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
ones in Maine you know where you stop
 
03:22:15.170 --> 03:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
they have people who work for uh
 
03:22:17.450 --> 03:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Fried Chicken or or Dunkin
 
03:22:19.969 --> 03:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
Donuts in those centers and we have a we
 
03:22:22.190 --> 03:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
have centers like that like that in
 
03:22:24.410 --> 03:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
Hooksett North and southbound and those
 
03:22:26.570 --> 03:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
as you know are well staffed it's when
 
03:22:28.670 --> 03:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
you get to the to the the facilities
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
that are federally required that are
 
03:22:33.769 --> 03:22:33.779 align:start position:0%
just a center with a fireplace and two
 
03:22:36.650 --> 03:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
bathrooms and some brochures that this
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
becomes a more difficult component and
 
03:22:41.330 --> 03:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
there are federal regulations about what
 
03:22:43.250 --> 03:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
you can put in those centers so we can't
 
03:22:46.370 --> 03:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
we've for example we went to the
 
03:22:49.190 --> 03:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
Intervale Center up in North Conway or
 
03:22:50.809 --> 03:22:50.819 align:start position:0%
an interview just outside of North
 
03:22:55.370 --> 03:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
Conway and uh we asked if the local
 
03:22:57.650 --> 03:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
chamber would work with us to help staff
 
03:23:00.769 --> 03:23:00.779 align:start position:0%
that facility and then they they were
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
not willing to do that and then we
 
03:23:03.710 --> 03:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
worked with White Mountains attractions
 
03:23:05.809 --> 03:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
because they have a facility in Lincoln
 
03:23:07.490 --> 03:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
that's not one of our welcome centers
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
but it serves as that if they would want
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
to do one on the other side of the White
 
03:23:14.269 --> 03:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
Mountains and they also said no so it it
 
03:23:16.490 --> 03:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
it it's not like we're not looking for
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
Solutions we have worked with a
 
03:23:20.450 --> 03:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
department Department of administrative
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
services to address the pay issue we did
 
03:23:26.750 --> 03:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
get the clerks that work for the Bureau
 
03:23:28.910 --> 03:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
of visitor services to pay level that is
 
03:23:30.950 --> 03:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
similar to people who work for state
 
03:23:34.309 --> 03:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
parks so you know lining up all the
 
03:23:35.690 --> 03:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
different categories that they have
 
03:23:37.729 --> 03:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
there and that has helped to some degree
 
03:23:39.950 --> 03:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
but we still have challenges in some
 
03:23:43.729 --> 03:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
areas of of the state as it relates to
 
03:23:45.410 --> 03:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
these so we have 12 of these centers and
 
03:23:48.170 --> 03:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
as I have said our goal is to keep the
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
main transportation corridors staffed
 
03:23:53.750 --> 03:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
seven days some we're there most of the
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
time I would say 80 to 90 percent we're
 
03:23:57.590 --> 03:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
in that category and if we're not it's
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
going to be like a Tuesday it's not
 
03:24:01.370 --> 03:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
going to be on a weekend but some of the
 
03:24:04.969 --> 03:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
centers outside of that sometimes get a
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more difficult
 
03:24:11.030 --> 03:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
so what's the specific problem with uh
 
03:24:13.070 --> 03:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
up in Lebanon the one just outside of
 
03:24:14.990 --> 03:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
Lebanon 89.
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
I know that we've heard from reps and
 
03:24:18.530 --> 03:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
Eddie or they just bought a parties
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
there and well the porta potty thing is
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
another whole is another whole issue
 
03:24:25.790 --> 03:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
right I mean they're those you know we
 
03:24:27.889 --> 03:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
we contract that service with a third
 
03:24:32.150 --> 03:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
party who are in the same boat as we are
 
03:24:33.950 --> 03:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
as far as staff so we have had
 
03:24:36.229 --> 03:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
situations where I've heard the same
 
03:24:37.849 --> 03:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
thing that you've heard about the
 
03:24:39.769 --> 03:24:39.779 align:start position:0%
condition of the porta potties because
 
03:24:41.929 --> 03:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
somebody didn't show up to work on
 
03:24:44.030 --> 03:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
Sunday that paid that drives the porta
 
03:24:46.849 --> 03:24:46.859 align:start position:0%
potty truck and it got left and so
 
03:24:49.429 --> 03:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
you've got a whole weekend in there and
 
03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
that it is is not a place that you want
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
to be but again I I you know we have a
 
03:24:55.849 --> 03:24:55.859 align:start position:0%
contract with someone that's supposed to
 
03:24:57.650 --> 03:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
deliver they don't have somebody to
 
03:24:59.330 --> 03:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
drive the truck they don't show up and
 
03:25:02.889 --> 03:25:02.899 align:start position:0%
that's that's the situation we get in
 
03:25:04.849 --> 03:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire followed by
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative evil thank you so just
 
03:25:09.410 --> 03:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
more detail do the people who work in
 
03:25:10.969 --> 03:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
these centers are they full-time or
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
part-time it's a mix
 
03:25:16.190 --> 03:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
okay mostly part mostly part-time so
 
03:25:18.650 --> 03:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
that one is straight pay right going
 
03:25:21.950 --> 03:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
from 12 to 16 or something would help
 
03:25:24.590 --> 03:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and what about a greater use of
 
03:25:29.269 --> 03:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
Granite State ambassadors
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
so uh we do use Granite State
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
ambassadors in the Hooksett uh welcome
 
03:25:37.429 --> 03:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
centers I don't know sort of the status
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
of their use of their availability in
 
03:25:42.229 --> 03:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
the other centers I would have to check
 
03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
on that but we do not use Granite State
 
03:25:47.570 --> 03:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
ambassadors in the other centers
 
03:25:49.370 --> 03:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
yeah and it
 
03:25:50.809 --> 03:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
I think I think some of them have
 
03:25:52.670 --> 03:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
training I should say right you know the
 
03:25:54.170 --> 03:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
greatest State ambassadors do a training
 
03:25:56.750 --> 03:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
program and our staff is trained by them
 
03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
but they're just not actually giving us
 
03:26:00.769 --> 03:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
the individuals yeah but I think you
 
03:26:03.050 --> 03:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
could push it a little more I mean they
 
03:26:04.849 --> 03:26:04.859 align:start position:0%
take I do think you they take a little
 
03:26:07.309 --> 03:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
money from you right to run the things
 
03:26:07.319 --> 03:26:08.809 align:start position:0%
money from you right to run the things
but

03:26:08.809 --> 03:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:26:11.570 --> 03:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
um but I think that's a possibility of
 
03:26:13.610 --> 03:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
getting more people not to clean
 
03:26:17.990 --> 03:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
bathrooms but to meet visitors yeah I am
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.439 --> 03:26:24.650 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:26:24.650 --> 03:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:26:26.690 --> 03:26:26.700 align:start position:0%
who knew this would be the Hot Topic
 
03:26:29.809 --> 03:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
somehow it often becomes well so I'm
 
03:26:32.090 --> 03:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
just going back in time I remember there
 
03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
was like this big rigmarole between
 
03:26:38.690 --> 03:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
D.O.T and you folks as to who owned the
 
03:26:41.750 --> 03:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
facilities who was maintaining them
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
who was responsible for mulling and and
 
03:26:48.349 --> 03:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
then there was going to be an mou I mean
 
03:26:51.290 --> 03:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
yeah so that all got worked out so it's
 
03:26:55.490 --> 03:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
now very clear so dot owns yes but you
 
03:26:58.130 --> 03:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
run the whole show correct we manage the
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
facilities and that mou was something
 
03:27:04.969 --> 03:27:04.979 align:start position:0%
something that was a source of
 
03:27:09.950 --> 03:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion uh prior to be a and
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
when we came in and again our bureau
 
03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
chief Bob Vashon worked with Dot and we
 
03:27:16.849 --> 03:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
got that all set so we're in a very
 
03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:19.010 align:start position:0%
happy place with them right now yes
 
03:27:19.010 --> 03:27:23.330 align:start position:0%
happy place with them right now yes
[Music]

03:27:23.330 --> 03:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:25.729 --> 03:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative hatch thank you back to
 
03:27:28.490 --> 03:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
my original question when might I expect
 
03:27:31.190 --> 03:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
an answer in terms of what I need to
 
03:27:33.889 --> 03:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
keep the centers open yes staff I need
 
03:27:36.170 --> 03:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
staff and what you need to do what you
 
03:27:39.170 --> 03:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
need to do in terms of finances or
 
03:27:42.530 --> 03:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
otherwise to get that stuff that well I
 
03:27:43.670 --> 03:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to just off the top of my
 
03:27:45.290 --> 03:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
head but it's going to be more than what
 
03:27:50.389 --> 03:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
a week or so
 
03:27:56.870 --> 03:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:58.849 --> 03:27:58.859 align:start position:0%
all right commissioner moving right
 
03:27:58.859 --> 03:28:00.469 align:start position:0%
all right commissioner moving right
along

03:28:00.469 --> 03:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
along
 
03:28:02.330 --> 03:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
um maybe what I might do at this point
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
is maybe turn it over to Lori uh to talk
 
03:28:08.330 --> 03:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
about uh the the marketing work that we
 
03:28:10.429 --> 03:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
do at the department and walk you
 
03:28:11.809 --> 03:28:11.819 align:start position:0%
through some of those
 
03:28:13.490 --> 03:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
components and then I'll just come back
 
03:28:14.750 --> 03:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
right at the end and talk a little about
 
03:28:17.570 --> 03:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at for the next for
 
03:28:20.389 --> 03:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
the next two years and then we can
 
03:28:21.950 --> 03:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
continue discussing whenever you'd like
 
03:28:24.290 --> 03:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
that works sounds good well thank you
 
03:28:26.090 --> 03:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
for having me today
 
03:28:28.190 --> 03:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
um so just a little bit more about the
 
03:28:30.050 --> 03:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
marketing efforts that the division of
 
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism does so we are a
 
03:28:34.729 --> 03:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
staff of nine people we have a lot of
 
03:28:36.290 --> 03:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
different contractors that we work with
 
03:28:39.170 --> 03:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
Granite State ambassadors is one of them
 
03:28:41.510 --> 03:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
um but other contractors like an ad
 
03:28:44.090 --> 03:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
agency PR firms
 
03:28:47.210 --> 03:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
um research firms so uh it's a really a
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
multi-faceted approach that we take in
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
promoting New Hampshire as a travel
 
03:28:50.399 --> 03:28:52.309 align:start position:0%
promoting New Hampshire as a travel
destination

03:28:52.309 --> 03:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
destination
 
03:28:55.570 --> 03:28:55.580 align:start position:0%
um our total budget is about 9.5 million
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
and just give you some comparison on how
 
03:29:01.190 --> 03:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
we are with our most competing states
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
because as you know now that we are back
 
03:29:07.450 --> 03:29:07.460 align:start position:0%
in or we're recovering from covid
 
03:29:09.530 --> 03:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
competition is going to be fierce
 
03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
because people have lots of different
 
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
options to go to to travel so oftentimes
 
03:29:16.790 --> 03:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
We compare ourselves
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
based upon population
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
geographic location with the state of
 
03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
Maine specifically Vermont as well but
 
03:29:26.090 --> 03:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's a little different than what what
 
03:29:28.269 --> 03:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's characteristics that are
 
03:29:31.130 --> 03:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
so the state of Maine's total budget is
 
03:29:33.170 --> 03:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
about double of what we have to spend to
 
03:29:36.650 --> 03:29:36.660 align:start position:0%
Market our destination so it's very
 
03:29:39.309 --> 03:29:39.319 align:start position:0%
important that we do it uh very smartly
 
03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
data driven as we move through this and
 
03:29:45.650 --> 03:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
in a variety of different tactics we
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
also as the commissioner had pointed out
 
03:29:49.849 --> 03:29:49.859 align:start position:0%
that we are really the marketing arm for
 
03:29:50.809 --> 03:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:29:53.690 --> 03:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
so what we and I I guess the Silver
 
03:29:56.090 --> 03:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
Lining with the pandemic was that we
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
really uh began working very closely
 
03:30:00.710 --> 03:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
with other state agencies
 
03:30:03.410 --> 03:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the need for the tourism
 
03:30:05.929 --> 03:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
industry but a variety of different
 
03:30:08.929 --> 03:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
um sectors so one we've also worked with
 
03:30:12.229 --> 03:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
like the DMV on CDL uh marketing
 
03:30:14.809 --> 03:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
campaigns we've worked with Employment
 
03:30:17.690 --> 03:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
Security on trying to recruit Workforce
 
03:30:20.450 --> 03:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
because we really see today's Travelers
 
03:30:24.950 --> 03:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
as tomorrow's Talent so it's a great
 
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
um PR if you will campaign to convince
 
03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
Travelers that hey you probably would
 
03:30:32.210 --> 03:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
want to consider living here working
 
03:30:34.910 --> 03:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
here being part of a New Hampshire's
 
03:30:38.030 --> 03:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
land landscape so as I mentioned we do
 
03:30:39.710 --> 03:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
this through a variety of different ways
 
03:30:42.190 --> 03:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
we through the pandemic we actually
 
03:30:45.410 --> 03:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
adjusted how the target markets that we
 
03:30:48.170 --> 03:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
promote New Hampshire in historically we
 
03:30:50.929 --> 03:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
always looked at New England New York
 
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
and Eastern Canada with the pandemic we
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
expanded our marketing reach to a 600
 
03:31:00.590 --> 03:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
mile radius of New Hampshire and we saw
 
03:31:02.510 --> 03:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
some great return on that so we're
 
03:31:04.570 --> 03:31:04.580 align:start position:0%
continuing with those efforts
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
also moving forward to continue to
 
03:31:10.670 --> 03:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
Market in Canada as the borders have
 
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
opened again it's very critical for us
 
03:31:15.950 --> 03:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
to retain those Travelers that had come
 
03:31:17.870 --> 03:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
down to New Hampshire before the
 
03:31:19.790 --> 03:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic but as well as our
 
03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
International or overseas Travelers
 
03:31:24.830 --> 03:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
um specifically we're seeing trends that
 
03:31:28.190 --> 03:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
the traveler from Eastern uh Western
 
03:31:30.410 --> 03:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
Europe excuse me are getting back to the
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
levels that they were before the
 
03:31:34.010 --> 03:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
pandemic to the U.S so it's important
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
for us to also be targeting those
 
03:31:38.330 --> 03:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
Travelers because they are not weather
 
03:31:41.210 --> 03:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
dependent they stay longer spend more
 
03:31:43.610 --> 03:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
money so it's very important for us to
 
03:31:47.090 --> 03:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
keep them as part of our marketing mix
 
03:31:49.910 --> 03:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
um we are really uh we I think in your
 
03:31:51.889 --> 03:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
packet we've got some examples of some
 
03:31:54.290 --> 03:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
of the ads that we've done but it's a
 
03:31:56.269 --> 03:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
wide variety of whether it's television
 
03:31:59.690 --> 03:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
ads Billboards or out of home ads we do
 
03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
these destination takeovers so there we
 
03:32:07.250 --> 03:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
like took over back Bays uh uh t-stop
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
Station in Boston
 
03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of digital advertising
 
03:32:15.170 --> 03:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
as well so that we can really track how
 
03:32:16.729 --> 03:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
the traveler
 
03:32:19.729 --> 03:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
um uh from the beginning part of the
 
03:32:21.530 --> 03:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
funnel the marketing funnel to how they
 
03:32:23.210 --> 03:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
where they choose to come on their final
 
03:32:26.330 --> 03:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
vacation location
 
03:32:29.450 --> 03:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
um so we do that we um we so we measure
 
03:32:31.309 --> 03:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
that through our return on investment
 
03:32:34.370 --> 03:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
and it's a very conservative uh
 
03:32:37.370 --> 03:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
um uh uh estimate that they put forward
 
03:32:39.650 --> 03:32:39.660 align:start position:0%
our research firm which is Smarty so
 
03:32:42.650 --> 03:32:42.660 align:start position:0%
they really look at the total they
 
03:32:45.290 --> 03:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
survey our whole the areas where we
 
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
market look at who
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
um has seen the ads who we have
 
03:32:52.429 --> 03:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
influenced and who actually has come to
 
03:32:55.010 --> 03:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so those are really more
 
03:32:57.889 --> 03:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
of a data driven approach to prove the
 
03:33:00.050 --> 03:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
investment that for every dollar that we
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
spend it Returns the latest one that
 
03:33:04.849 --> 03:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
continues to increase year over year but
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
the latest is about a sixteen dollars
 
03:33:10.429 --> 03:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
return on investment we also as we're
 
03:33:11.929 --> 03:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
looking at the
 
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
um the workforce and
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
um uh just the the migration rate of New
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we see that continuously
 
03:33:22.130 --> 03:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
moving forward and increasing which is a
 
03:33:24.490 --> 03:33:24.500 align:start position:0%
a positive
 
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
approach for the state so that is
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
encouraging and we'd like to continue on
 
03:33:30.290 --> 03:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
and the last thing that I wanted to
 
03:33:35.690 --> 03:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
bring up is that we continue to look at
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole and the best
 
03:33:40.429 --> 03:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
strategy on how we can develop and
 
03:33:42.530 --> 03:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
Market uh the state as a tourism
 
03:33:45.590 --> 03:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
destination so we are continuing to do
 
03:33:47.570 --> 03:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
that we're working through a strategy
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
now for the next five years on the plan
 
03:33:52.610 --> 03:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
and so that we can really historically
 
03:33:54.769 --> 03:33:54.779 align:start position:0%
we've always looked at number of
 
03:33:57.050 --> 03:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
visitors and how much they spend but we
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're looking at
 
03:34:01.790 --> 03:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
all data points that we are looking at
 
03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
for those Travelers that are going to
 
03:34:05.570 --> 03:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
also make sure that we have a
 
03:34:07.370 --> 03:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
sustainable tourism and moving forward
 
03:34:10.550 --> 03:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
so that's really kind of the the plan of
 
03:34:13.150 --> 03:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
attack for tourism for us
 
03:34:13.160 --> 03:34:14.950 align:start position:0%
attack for tourism for us
questions

03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:34:18.670 --> 03:34:18.680 align:start position:0%
representative from Mont Vernon
 
03:34:20.870 --> 03:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of interested in the
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
demographics of the state but I'm also
 
03:34:26.210 --> 03:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
interested in the demographics of the
 
03:34:26.220 --> 03:34:27.950 align:start position:0%
interested in the demographics of the
tourists

03:34:27.950 --> 03:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
tourists
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
and who do you rely on I know the
 
03:34:30.960 --> 03:34:32.450 align:start position:0%
and who do you rely on I know the
University

03:34:32.450 --> 03:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
University
 
03:34:35.809 --> 03:34:35.819 align:start position:0%
has a section there where they do some
 
03:34:38.410 --> 03:34:38.420 align:start position:0%
pretty good work on demographics
 
03:34:41.870 --> 03:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
who who do you people rely on
 
03:34:44.809 --> 03:34:44.819 align:start position:0%
yeah well you could speak to tourism I
 
03:34:46.250 --> 03:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
think uh as far as you're absolutely
 
03:34:47.570 --> 03:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
right Carson Institute and the
 
03:34:49.969 --> 03:34:49.979 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire has a really
 
03:34:51.950 --> 03:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
robust program of tracking the the
 
03:34:53.450 --> 03:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
migration numbers and the number of
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
people that are the net migration number
 
03:34:58.130 --> 03:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
is really what we're looking at
 
03:35:00.290 --> 03:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
um when you when you kind of get to that
 
03:35:01.729 --> 03:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
point and you look at what they've been
 
03:35:04.250 --> 03:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
able to uh you know track over the last
 
03:35:06.889 --> 03:35:06.899 align:start position:0%
several years and compare that to other
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
Northeastern states we come out on top
 
03:35:13.010 --> 03:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
every every year so it's not in and of
 
03:35:17.150 --> 03:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
itself you know Gonna Change uh huge
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
numbers and you're talking in a couple
 
03:35:20.929 --> 03:35:20.939 align:start position:0%
of thousand people probably each year
 
03:35:23.690 --> 03:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
but that is a in positive territory is a
 
03:35:24.950 --> 03:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
very different place than where we have
 
03:35:27.469 --> 03:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
been in the past
 
03:35:30.650 --> 03:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
yeah and in regards to the uh tourism
 
03:35:32.929 --> 03:35:32.939 align:start position:0%
visitor we look at specific so for
 
03:35:35.030 --> 03:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
example we Market in in New York right
 
03:35:35.040 --> 03:35:36.410 align:start position:0%
example we Market in in New York right
so

03:35:36.410 --> 03:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
um we we adjust like we had
 
03:35:40.490 --> 03:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
um so Marketing in New York is very
 
03:35:40.500 --> 03:35:41.870 align:start position:0%
um so Marketing in New York is very
expensive

03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
03:35:43.910 --> 03:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
um especially in the city so actually we
 
03:35:46.849 --> 03:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
had started off there many years ago but
 
03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
then as we wanted to really drill down
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
on what typical traveler is going to
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire from New York most
 
03:35:55.490 --> 03:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
likely right in the heart of like you
 
03:35:57.290 --> 03:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
know New York City it's a lot of
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
visitors they're not necessarily
 
03:36:02.210 --> 03:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
residents so we've adjusted to specific
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
communities around that would be more
 
03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
typical to come to New Hampshire that
 
03:36:10.729 --> 03:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
have that income level that would be
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for us to try to to encourage
 
03:36:15.650 --> 03:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
them to consider New Hampshire as a
 
03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
travel destination and we do that in all
 
03:36:19.130 --> 03:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
those main target markets that I
 
03:36:20.570 --> 03:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
03:36:24.050 --> 03:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
another question representative Griffin
 
03:36:25.849 --> 03:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
so kind of piggybacking on
 
03:36:28.849 --> 03:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin's question how do
 
03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
you determine like for instance the
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
average taxable trip spending you
 
03:36:35.809 --> 03:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
obviously don't have the commissioner
 
03:36:37.729 --> 03:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
standing down in Nashville to stopping
 
03:36:39.530 --> 03:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
cars periodically to see how much they
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
spent so how do you determine those
 
03:36:43.370 --> 03:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah that's a great question so
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
we work with our research firm which is
 
03:36:50.650 --> 03:36:50.660 align:start position:0%
Smarty insights and they survey
 
03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
Travelers that are from these core
 
03:36:55.250 --> 03:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
markets that we Market to and they use a
 
03:36:55.260 --> 03:36:57.370 align:start position:0%
markets that we Market to and they use a
benchmarking

03:36:57.370 --> 03:36:57.380 align:start position:0%
benchmarking
 
03:37:00.170 --> 03:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
analysis that's based upon National Data
 
03:37:03.769 --> 03:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
that evaluates typically what the spend
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
would be so we take that amount per
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
traveler and base it upon the
 
03:37:11.929 --> 03:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
incremental visitors so how many did we
 
03:37:14.030 --> 03:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
influence to come to New Hampshire and
 
03:37:17.330 --> 03:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
that gives you that total spend
 
03:37:19.070 --> 03:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative evil did you have a
 
03:37:22.010 --> 03:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
question thank you will you um use the
 
03:37:23.570 --> 03:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
word that I was sort of thinking about
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
making your tourism sustainable could
 
03:37:29.290 --> 03:37:29.300 align:start position:0%
you talk about the effect of the weather
 
03:37:33.969 --> 03:37:33.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.950 --> 03:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah whatever you want to say that gives
 
03:37:40.670 --> 03:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
me heartburn right yeah so um that's a
 
03:37:42.290 --> 03:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
great question and so yeah it's very
 
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
important for us to look at sustainable
 
03:37:47.630 --> 03:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
tourism so in the sense of climate so
 
03:37:50.030 --> 03:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
that how can we help those businesses
 
03:37:52.969 --> 03:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
that are in the state adjust their how
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
their operations are so many ski areas
 
03:37:57.410 --> 03:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
have adjusted to add other activities
 
03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
such as zip lining
 
03:38:03.469 --> 03:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
um uh Fat Tire biking a variety of
 
03:38:05.090 --> 03:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
different other activities that they can
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
do to help balance out those that
 
03:38:10.070 --> 03:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
shorter ski season that we're seeing but
 
03:38:12.290 --> 03:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at sustainability in
 
03:38:15.290 --> 03:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
the sense of such things as our
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure like uh for Ev vehicles
 
03:38:20.570 --> 03:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
and you know knowing that
 
03:38:23.630 --> 03:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
um States like other states like Vermont
 
03:38:26.210 --> 03:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts have a pretty
 
03:38:28.849 --> 03:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
aggressive uh look at that that we want
 
03:38:30.250 --> 03:38:30.260 align:start position:0%
to make sure that New Hampshire doesn't
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
fall behind in the sense that if people
 
03:38:35.150 --> 03:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
don't have a a place to charge their
 
03:38:37.250 --> 03:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
vehicle would they not come so looking
 
03:38:40.010 --> 03:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
at as a whole and for sustainable
 
03:38:42.889 --> 03:38:42.899 align:start position:0%
tourism in that sense so
 
03:38:45.229 --> 03:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
I might just add to that I mean this is
 
03:38:46.729 --> 03:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
a challenge right I mean you've we've
 
03:38:49.309 --> 03:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
we've got a tourism Market that is based
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
in large part on outdoor recreation and
 
03:38:54.170 --> 03:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
access to natural resources and all
 
03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things
 
03:38:57.769 --> 03:38:57.779 align:start position:0%
but as we have seen over the last couple
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
years particularly since covid just a
 
03:39:01.849 --> 03:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
tremendous increase in the number of
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
people that are looking to be able to
 
03:39:06.050 --> 03:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
take advantage of those types of assets
 
03:39:09.349 --> 03:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
so you know if you've been to Franconia
 
03:39:11.210 --> 03:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
Notch during the summer the last couple
 
03:39:13.969 --> 03:39:13.979 align:start position:0%
of years we've worked with dncr and
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
state parks and Dot to address people
 
03:39:19.010 --> 03:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
parking literally on the side of the
 
03:39:21.710 --> 03:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
interstate in minivans with their kids
 
03:39:23.450 --> 03:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
and getting out you know with logging
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
trucks going by this that was a
 
03:39:27.349 --> 03:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
completely untenable situation and we
 
03:39:28.849 --> 03:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
came together you know state parks
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
particularly Franconia Notch state park
 
03:39:32.269 --> 03:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
it came with a you know they've got some
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
Vans and we started to have people Park
 
03:39:36.290 --> 03:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
up at the up at the Peabody lift and
 
03:39:38.710 --> 03:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
then we would drive them down
 
03:39:38.720 --> 03:39:40.429 align:start position:0%
then we would drive them down
but

03:39:40.429 --> 03:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:39:43.849 --> 03:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
um the increase in activity as you will
 
03:39:46.130 --> 03:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
hear like from Scott Mason at fish and
 
03:39:48.050 --> 03:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
game and the number of rescues and the
 
03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
way that state parks is moving towards a
 
03:39:52.370 --> 03:39:52.380 align:start position:0%
reservation based system to be able to
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
control crowds these are all aspects of
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
what I would say is a post-covered
 
03:40:00.050 --> 03:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation slash tourism
 
03:40:02.990 --> 03:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
strategy all seated in the fact that
 
03:40:05.090 --> 03:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
that is a not an infinite natural
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
resource and uh at the same time trying
 
03:40:10.849 --> 03:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
to grow and maintain a really critical
 
03:40:13.250 --> 03:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
industry and employer for the State of
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that is really our
 
03:40:18.769 --> 03:40:18.779 align:start position:0%
challenge right now and we're working
 
03:40:22.370 --> 03:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
with as uh as Laurie pointed out a firm
 
03:40:23.809 --> 03:40:23.819 align:start position:0%
to kind of give us a little bit more
 
03:40:25.790 --> 03:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
insight as to how we might be able to
 
03:40:28.010 --> 03:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
accomplish that as part of a state
 
03:40:29.809 --> 03:40:29.819 align:start position:0%
strategy where we're not just purely
 
03:40:31.969 --> 03:40:31.979 align:start position:0%
just you know measuring how many people
 
03:40:33.769 --> 03:40:33.779 align:start position:0%
came and how much they spent I mean I
 
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
think we need to go a little deeper than
 
03:40:37.250 --> 03:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
that and talk about ways that we can get
 
03:40:39.410 --> 03:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
people to go to other areas instead of
 
03:40:41.330 --> 03:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
just a Franconia notch or just to the
 
03:40:43.610 --> 03:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
Appalachian Trailhead or just to die in
 
03:40:45.410 --> 03:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
his baths you know the places that are
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
just clogged with people in the middle
 
03:40:49.610 --> 03:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
of the summer time so it is a challenge
 
03:40:50.990 --> 03:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
and we want to be able to accommodate
 
03:40:52.490 --> 03:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
those people and give them a very strong
 
03:40:53.929 --> 03:40:53.939 align:start position:0%
experience when they come here and in
 
03:40:55.729 --> 03:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
the end that probably has
 
03:40:57.650 --> 03:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
some strong connection to what we end up
 
03:40:57.660 --> 03:41:01.190 align:start position:0%
some strong connection to what we end up
with

03:41:01.190 --> 03:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
other questions representative McGuire
 
03:41:06.769 --> 03:41:06.779 align:start position:0%
thank you so you mentioned uh migration
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I read an interesting statistic
 
03:41:12.170 --> 03:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
recently that 30 percent of all home
 
03:41:14.870 --> 03:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
sales in our state are to people who
 
03:41:16.729 --> 03:41:16.739 align:start position:0%
don't live in New Hampshire
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
and of that 30 percent over half are
 
03:41:22.490 --> 03:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
people from Massachusetts
 
03:41:26.210 --> 03:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that your marketing and
 
03:41:27.429 --> 03:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
and the other thing about Massachusetts
 
03:41:31.729 --> 03:41:31.739 align:start position:0%
they just recently passed this horrible
 
03:41:36.410 --> 03:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
um tax millionaires tax so so you know
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're already primed to move and and
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
you know get the the boot is kicking
 
03:41:45.650 --> 03:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
them out the door kind of thing so for
 
03:41:47.469 --> 03:41:47.479 align:start position:0%
for your marketing
 
03:41:49.910 --> 03:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
dollars do you do you kind of over
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
Market extra in Massachusetts do you
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
push a little there
 
03:41:56.809 --> 03:41:56.819 align:start position:0%
well I mean you've you're you're you're
 
03:41:58.849 --> 03:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct representative and
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
that is uh got to continue to be a big
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
part of our challenge Airbnb uh uh it's
 
03:42:06.530 --> 03:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
a good example in a lot of areas like
 
03:42:08.330 --> 03:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
the Mount Washington Valley and
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
increasingly up in Littleton Bethlehem
 
03:42:13.010 --> 03:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
and those areas uh you have
 
03:42:15.290 --> 03:42:15.300 align:start position:0%
um people that can afford a house in
 
03:42:17.690 --> 03:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem that work in Boston so they'll
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
buy the house aim to go there someday
 
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime they're going to
 
03:42:23.410 --> 03:42:23.420 align:start position:0%
rent it to all their friends from Boston
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh not so bad for tourism at least in
 
03:42:28.490 --> 03:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
terms of that dollar figure but pretty
 
03:42:30.410 --> 03:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
bad for tourism when you've now taken
 
03:42:32.330 --> 03:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
away a home that could have been an
 
03:42:34.790 --> 03:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
employee that worked at the you know at
 
03:42:36.290 --> 03:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
the ski area or at the restaurant or
 
03:42:38.929 --> 03:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
whatever so these are all significant
 
03:42:41.990 --> 03:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
challenges I would say that they are uh
 
03:42:44.809 --> 03:42:44.819 align:start position:0%
probably more in the side of influenced
 
03:42:48.889 --> 03:42:48.899 align:start position:0%
by market and by cost and by other other
 
03:42:50.809 --> 03:42:50.819 align:start position:0%
sort of financial drivers than they are
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
by marketing uh the marketing component
 
03:42:55.010 --> 03:42:55.020 align:start position:0%
I think gets the people interest just
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
didn't get some here we've been doing
 
03:42:58.250 --> 03:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
that for some time we're seeing that
 
03:43:00.590 --> 03:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
increase but a lot of it is really based
 
03:43:02.809 --> 03:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
in the market dynamics where as
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
expensive as it is for people who live
 
03:43:07.250 --> 03:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
in the North Country uh in in in
 
03:43:09.170 --> 03:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
relative comparison to where they've
 
03:43:10.550 --> 03:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
been in the last few years it's
 
03:43:13.190 --> 03:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
extremely cheap for people that are from
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know outside of the Boston area
 
03:43:18.410 --> 03:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
so that becomes a challenge and you're
 
03:43:20.410 --> 03:43:20.420 align:start position:0%
you're also correct we are seeing
 
03:43:24.170 --> 03:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
increases of home sales particularly in
 
03:43:25.750 --> 03:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire since that
 
03:43:27.769 --> 03:43:27.779 align:start position:0%
millionaires tax or whatever we want to
 
03:43:30.830 --> 03:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
call it was passed in Massachusetts uh I
 
03:43:32.630 --> 03:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
think I saw somewhere that a house just
 
03:43:34.610 --> 03:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
sold on the Seacoast for something like
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars so
 
03:43:39.170 --> 03:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
um it's it's we're getting into the
 
03:43:40.729 --> 03:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
category that we've seen in a lot of
 
03:43:43.849 --> 03:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
other states on the housing thing
 
03:43:45.170 --> 03:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:48.130 --> 03:43:48.140 align:start position:0%
that's a very interesting statistical
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
situation I guess it is and the Airbnb
 
03:43:53.090 --> 03:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
thing I look I get it but it's sort of
 
03:43:56.030 --> 03:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
like what Uber did to taxis and and and
 
03:43:58.309 --> 03:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
try as you may in a couple of different
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions to try to get at that from
 
03:44:02.690 --> 03:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
a statutory or a legal standpoint it
 
03:44:04.250 --> 03:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
didn't you know there wasn't any real
 
03:44:05.870 --> 03:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
basis for that there was doing maybe
 
03:44:08.030 --> 03:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
increased cost here or there but we
 
03:44:10.729 --> 03:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
can't say you know straight out like you
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
can't Airbnb your house I mean we can't
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
do that
 
03:44:15.290 --> 03:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
um there's probably other ways that you
 
03:44:16.550 --> 03:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
can get around the edges but whether
 
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
that fundamentally turns you know change
 
03:44:19.969 --> 03:44:19.979 align:start position:0%
it to die I don't know but it's
 
03:44:21.650 --> 03:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
a pretty interesting question and when
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
the dynamic
 
03:44:24.830 --> 03:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
always a lot of challenges
 
03:44:26.870 --> 03:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative evil thanks well I was
 
03:44:29.830 --> 03:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
just going to say we just sold our house
 
03:44:33.530 --> 03:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
and I had five offers you know like that
 
03:44:36.290 --> 03:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
and everyone bought one they were
 
03:44:38.690 --> 03:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
looking at having just a second house in
 
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:44:44.050 --> 03:44:44.060 align:start position:0%
and it was a family house and I was
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
determined that it would go to the
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
family so that's where it went yeah but
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know if you're if you're not mindful
 
03:44:54.710 --> 03:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
of that it just keeps sucking things out
 
03:44:56.990 --> 03:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
away from families making everything
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and we're trying to on the other
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
side you know facilitate more affordable
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
housing Workforce housing make
 
03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
investments in those categories but you
 
03:45:08.150 --> 03:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
know the market itself is taking away a
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
lot of you know what was there to start
 
03:45:11.290 --> 03:45:11.300 align:start position:0%
with so
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
unquestionably uh what the biggest
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
challenge in my view the biggest
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
challenge to to the economy is housing
 
03:45:21.050 --> 03:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
and that's I think good examples of why
 
03:45:22.969 --> 03:45:22.979 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's not all zoning to me
 
03:45:28.849 --> 03:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh representative McGuire well just
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
along this discussion I'm on the
 
03:45:33.349 --> 03:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
planning board for my town we had a
 
03:45:35.690 --> 03:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
developer coming visited us this week
 
03:45:38.210 --> 03:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
who wants to build a 15-unit development
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
and he says he simply cannot build a
 
03:45:43.190 --> 03:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand dollar house
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
anymore these are going to be 550
 
03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
000 houses you know it's just incredible
 
03:45:52.990 --> 03:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
I was at a development uh this past week
 
03:45:56.690 --> 03:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
uh multi-family uh I think it was like
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
maybe 50 units and while we were there
 
03:46:01.729 --> 03:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
and these are energy efficient units
 
03:46:03.229 --> 03:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
they're under construction right now
 
03:46:04.670 --> 03:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
they all have these you know cruddy
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
looking doors on the front of them it's
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
because the doors haven't been available
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh and they ordered them I think he said
 
03:46:13.190 --> 03:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
like 15 months ago and while we were
 
03:46:15.050 --> 03:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
there they the truck actually pulled in
 
03:46:16.849 --> 03:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
with the doors and everybody was super
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
excited about but I mean it's an
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation because what it
 
03:46:22.849 --> 03:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
does the the whole business of
 
03:46:25.010 --> 03:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
development has completely changed as a
 
03:46:26.929 --> 03:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
result of supply chain challenges labor
 
03:46:29.030 --> 03:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
force challenges all these costs that
 
03:46:30.490 --> 03:46:30.500 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about
 
03:46:32.929 --> 03:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
the way that they develop these things
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the amount of money that they have
 
03:46:38.210 --> 03:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
to front in order to order the doors
 
03:46:40.250 --> 03:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
probably before they're even permitted
 
03:46:43.429 --> 03:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh in order to make the the finances
 
03:46:46.729 --> 03:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
pencil out that's you know that's going
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
to Ripple through everything zoning and
 
03:46:52.130 --> 03:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
all the rest of it so we are in the
 
03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
midst of a lot of change and most of it
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:00.349 --> 03:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
very interesting discussion you know
 
03:47:02.210 --> 03:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
we're wrestling with affordable housing
 
03:47:03.769 --> 03:47:03.779 align:start position:0%
but because of our
 
03:47:07.250 --> 03:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
tax situation attracting people with
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
money here that are buying up the
 
03:47:10.429 --> 03:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
property so those folks that are looking
 
03:47:12.349 --> 03:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
for the affordable housing are even
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
pushed out further yes interesting
 
03:47:18.830 --> 03:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
well very oh further question
 
03:47:21.050 --> 03:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
Representative no I was going to say
 
03:47:24.349 --> 03:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
I think we have to do something along
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
the lines of allowing more multi-family
 
03:47:30.410 --> 03:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
you know places where because my town
 
03:47:33.950 --> 03:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
zones away multi-family right and so we
 
03:47:37.490 --> 03:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
have to we we can push that a bit
 
03:47:39.650 --> 03:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
I would agree with that you know density
 
03:47:45.530 --> 03:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
is not a bad thing right and
 
03:47:47.469 --> 03:47:47.479 align:start position:0%
um where we have been able to see
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
multi-family developments in communities
 
03:47:51.590 --> 03:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
that are willing to have those there
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
have been pretty tangible benefits to
 
03:47:56.990 --> 03:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
those communities from an economic and a
 
03:47:59.150 --> 03:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
community standpoint and those are not
 
03:48:00.410 --> 03:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
the types of units that are going to be
 
03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:03.479 align:start position:0%
Airbnb not in maybe in some cases but in
 
03:48:06.889 --> 03:48:06.899 align:start position:0%
in most cases not yeah a duplex is is
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
not twice the cost of a of a single
 
03:48:11.750 --> 03:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
family home right right you know sure
 
03:48:16.010 --> 03:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative Griffin thank you
 
03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner I wonder if you can ask
 
03:48:19.610 --> 03:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
this question
 
03:48:19.620 --> 03:48:21.650 align:start position:0%
this question
we

03:48:21.650 --> 03:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:48:24.290 --> 03:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
I served on the uh
 
03:48:27.590 --> 03:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
Commission on demographic change
 
03:48:30.170 --> 03:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
and we had a lot of people come in from
 
03:48:33.889 --> 03:48:33.899 align:start position:0%
UNH and other places and basically got a
 
03:48:36.410 --> 03:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
pretty solid education
 
03:48:39.650 --> 03:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
we didn't do much with that
 
03:48:42.050 --> 03:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that was raised at
 
03:48:43.849 --> 03:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
the time that we didn't get an answer
 
03:48:47.389 --> 03:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
for is a few years ago we changed the
 
03:48:48.769 --> 03:48:48.779 align:start position:0%
state law
 
03:48:51.469 --> 03:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
so that you could have an accessory
 
03:48:54.349 --> 03:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
building area on your lawn
 
03:48:58.210 --> 03:48:58.220 align:start position:0%
and the idea of that was to promote
 
03:49:01.729 --> 03:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
affordable housing on the theory that a
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
lot of people would build that kind of
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
housing for their in-laws and over time
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
those units
 
03:49:11.570 --> 03:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
would become available as affordable
 
03:49:11.580 --> 03:49:13.150 align:start position:0%
would become available as affordable
units

03:49:13.150 --> 03:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
units
 
03:49:16.010 --> 03:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
but nobody seems to have any statistics
 
03:49:18.410 --> 03:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
on how that works have you seen any
 
03:49:21.050 --> 03:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
thing on that I would say if they're
 
03:49:23.269 --> 03:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
there it's with New Hampshire housing I
 
03:49:25.130 --> 03:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
mean they have been running an Adu
 
03:49:26.809 --> 03:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
program and I know that they have you
 
03:49:29.389 --> 03:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
know they are the repository of a lot of
 
03:49:33.410 --> 03:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
data that we often will use for for
 
03:49:35.389 --> 03:49:35.399 align:start position:0%
these types of questions so I'd be happy
 
03:49:37.130 --> 03:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
to check in with them and see if they
 
03:49:38.809 --> 03:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
have any information and get it to you
 
03:49:40.849 --> 03:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
but I don't know it off the top of my
 
03:49:43.969 --> 03:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
I believe those are the people that we
 
03:49:46.080 --> 03:49:47.929 align:start position:0%
I believe those are the people that we
asked

03:49:47.929 --> 03:49:47.939 align:start position:0%
asked
 
03:49:49.550 --> 03:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
well this is a few years ago maybe
 
03:49:51.170 --> 03:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
they've had some time to look into it
 
03:49:53.570 --> 03:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'll ask for you
 
03:49:53.580 --> 03:49:55.250 align:start position:0%
I'll ask for you
yep

03:49:55.250 --> 03:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
yep
 
03:49:57.530 --> 03:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
well seeing no further questions thank
 
03:49:59.389 --> 03:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
you very much it was very useful
 
03:50:01.969 --> 03:50:01.979 align:start position:0%
presentation I think for all of us and
 
03:50:04.010 --> 03:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
and our representative hatch looks
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
forward to how we can get people into
 
03:50:07.729 --> 03:50:07.739 align:start position:0%
the rest areas in the next week or two
 
03:50:11.210 --> 03:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
thanks have a good weekend thank you for
 
03:50:16.309 --> 03:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:16.319 --> 03:50:18.500 align:start position:0%
