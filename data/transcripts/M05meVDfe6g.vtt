2358
 
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
um I guess um we' probably start with uh
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative ducet do you want to
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
introduce the
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
amendment good thank you Mr chairman
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh as we looked at this
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
at our last meeting what an
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
effect uh this amendment does is it puts
 
00:12:07.079 --> 00:12:08.870 align:start position:0%
effect uh this amendment does is it puts
a

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
moratorium on
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
expanded uh
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
HHR and
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
eliminates the charge of rent for the
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
Charities to participate in charitable
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
gaming that's kind of it in a
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
nutshell I think uh we've all heard
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and some of us on on the uh on
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
the committee are involved with the the
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
chable gaming commission uh rent has
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
been a an issue for not only the
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
Charities but those of us uh who
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
recognize it's long past its its time
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony that this was uh
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
the rank component was uh going back to
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
Inception of charal gaming the some
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
people referen the nights of
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh Casino nights and church basements to
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
you know make make the ends meet for
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
those folks that were operating those
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
and uh obviously with uh the Advent of
 
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
the model we have now and the expansion
 
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
of that model this is uh long overdue
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
eliminating this this rent
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
component secondarily to that the
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
moratorium on the HHR machine I think we
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
can all attest to the fact and I I know
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
specifically in my town the people I
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
represent in Salem um right now I
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
believe we have 14 or 15 charitable
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
gaming establishments in the state of
 
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.629 align:start position:0%
gaming establishments in the state of
New

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:13:47.949 --> 00:13:47.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh which far exceeds the
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
totality of New England I think we have
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
a phenomenal model that benefits our
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
Charities but I think we've all
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
witnessed what's trans transpired since
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
the Advent of the HHR component that One
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
Singular game um with the lodger
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
operations coming in buying up rooms uh
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
taking over the space from the local
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
operators um there's been great interest
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
in my town of
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
Salem um and you've heard me say it
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
before I think uh now is the time to to
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
put uh put the breaks on this um I don't
 
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:30.759 align:start position:0%
want to particular turn Salem into
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
Atlantic City you've heard me say that
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
time and time again these operators are
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
are really pushing for this you can just
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
look at the expansion of for instance
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
any of the Border towns but the nashar
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh one particular room has
 
00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.670 align:start position:0%
uh one particular room has
expanded

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
expanded
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
um you know we don't need to list them
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
all there's great benefit to the model
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
to Charities to the state and to The
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
Operators themselves but I think uh we
 
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
need to reel in what can get out of hand
 
00:15:05.069 --> 00:15:05.079 align:start position:0%
relatively quick with this component
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
this does not negate anybody
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
from uh applying for and receiving a
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operator's license uh
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
and as an
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
example uh in the last last I look last
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
five years of uh that I looked into it
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
back a little while ago there had been
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
no new applicants for charitable gaming
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
operators licenses in the last few
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
months there's been I believe director
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
McIntyre testified to four I'm hearing
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
rumors that may be five in the last few
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
months and and my opinion is that's a
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
direct component of the HHR game um and
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
I just hate to see us change the uh the
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
face of what the model we have in the
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
state is so I would I would ask for
 
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.509 align:start position:0%
state is so I would I would ask for
support

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
on uh Amendment 2358
 
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
and and uh I do have an amendment to
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
that in in the component you you'll also
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
have in front of you I have an updated
 
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839 align:start position:0%
uh more of a
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
friendly housekeeping Amendment 2444 H I
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
had missed uh Rick Newman had pointed
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
out to me I had missed in three
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
different paragraphs where rent was
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the statute so this
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
corrects that other than that there's no
 
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
changes this allows for
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
the four current applicants to uh
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
continue through the process with
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
Lottery and open up uh their operations
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
if they were approved so as it stands
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
now we have uh basically the possibility
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
of 19 charal gaming operations with HHR
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
so I submit that you know we we need to
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
put the breaks on this before it gets
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
out of hand thank you Mr
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
chair thank you and if you would out a
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
pink card later so we can have that for
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
the records that' be great okay I do
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
have one uh pink card in front of me um
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
forward thank you Mr chairman
 
00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:27.799 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Rick Newman I'm
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators Association
 
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
we are here today to support the
 
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to Senate Bill 112 um
 
00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
and the other housekeeping parts that
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
were originally in Senate B 112 I'll be
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
very brief it's uh uh first I'll speak
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
to the subject of rent representative
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
ducet touched on it this bill would this
 
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
amendment would uh prohibit the uh
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
charging of rent to Charities uh we do
 
00:17:59.789 --> 00:17:59.799 align:start position:0%
support that um uh rent was originally
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
put into the statute went back in a time
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
when the maximum bet was $2 in charity
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
gaming and it was very difficult for
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
operators to even make ends meet uh at
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
that level of Revenue later it was
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
increased to four and then in 10 and now
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
of course you folks have increased the
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
maximum bet to $50 and we believe that
 
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
there's no longer it's no longer
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
necessary that the rental charges be
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
included and this will benefit Charities
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
a great deal there be a significant
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
amount of additional Revenue to each
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
charity participating in games or chance
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
we also support um the second part that
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
is the major part of this bill which is
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
the um essentially uh creating a a
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
permanent moratorium beyond the those
 
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
who have applied or in the pipeline now
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
who might end up becoming a qualified
 
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
applicants as representative duet said
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
I've heard that uh it could be three or
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
four potential applicants that are going
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
through the process doesn't mean all of
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
them will qualify I don't know who they
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
are and uh but uh it seems to me that's
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
this is a reasonable approach to take to
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh put a uh so that we don't have on
 
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 2024 under the current law the
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
doors open up and we could have uh uh
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
historic horse racing in every strip
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
mall in every corner uh of the state I
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody thinks that's a good
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
idea thank you Mr chairman thank you any
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you I'll ask one of the ones I
 
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask representative set on this
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
is something that's just been bothering
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
me from the beginning I haven't done
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
anything about uh the rights of the
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
leny do does charitable gaming in
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
general have the right to kick people
 
00:19:52.669 --> 00:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
out well I think probably any business
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
has the right to tell someone to leave
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
The Establishment the it the the point
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
specific yeah this is is getting
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
specific because under current law other
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
paramutual licenses it is specific that
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
you can tell someone to leave and it's
 
00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:09.799 align:start position:0%
at the sole discretion of the operator
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
so that section simply adds historic
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
horse racing to the section that allows
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
that to happen at a simal cast
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
facility even though it
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
would it's different from a horse real
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
horse racing place where people can get
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
but it it just seemed There Are Places
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
all over the country where at least in
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
the past they have kicked people out
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
because they had a camera with
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
that frankly representative I don't
 
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
think that's a big part of the bill and
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to remove it you'd get no
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
objection from us I I really do View
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
that as a housekeeping section where HHR
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
is paramutual selc casting is paramutual
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
it's just including it in the same
 
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
cast

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
cast
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
you not really representative nter thank
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman the calendar note um
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
says that this hearing is for Amendment
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
2358 H but we're hearing about 2444 is
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
that correct so representative ducet
 
00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:32.430 align:start position:0%
that correct so representative ducet
introduced

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:21:34.269 --> 00:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
2358 and
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
23444 is
 
00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:38.919 align:start position:0%
actually um before you just because he
 
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
was pointing out a housekeeping change
 
00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
that we have to make to
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
2358 uh we were surprised when it came
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
back from OS I believe that it had a new
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
number we expected it to be 2358 with a
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
with a slight yes representative you
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
said Can clarify it's basically I I
 
00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:57.559 align:start position:0%
missed three paragraphs where I
 
00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned rent so we we're hearing uh
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
5'8 and this is a friendly Amendment
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to bring up after to include
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
all the components that needed to be
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
covered yes follow up well I texted the
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
clerk and I said because I'm confused
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
and um he said if it's this number is
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
not in the calendar that we cannot have
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
a hearing on
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
it okay told me to tell
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand the confusion I did
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
speak with the clerk on actually on this
 
00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
bill um not this particular Amendment
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
but the same issue if uh this non-
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment is
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
advertised and then I or someone else
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
comes in and wants to make a tweak or an
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
amendment to that with within the scope
 
00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
of the new non- gerain Amendment we can
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
do do that and um so we're having the
 
00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:04.149 align:start position:0%
do do that and um so we're having the
hearing

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
and our representative duet has
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
recognized as he's been looking at this
 
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:12.919 align:start position:0%
thing that there are a couple of changes
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
that are within the scope and actually
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
the word used by the clerk in talking
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
with me is if there's a
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
tweak essentially that's what this is
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
meaning within the scope of the non main
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that has now made made the
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
subject gerain it's okay so we're
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
discussing this bill um that is tweaked
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
by that is going to be tweaked if if we
 
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.230 align:start position:0%
by that is going to be tweaked if if we
accept

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
amendment uh yes follow up may I just
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
show you the text can I come over there
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:39.909 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
were these three paragraphs
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
important M Mr chairman if I if I may if
 
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
I may it seems to me you're having a
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
hearing on 2358 which was with what was
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
noticed what I understand is that at
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
some point there may be during your
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
executive session a friendly Amendment
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
off offered to
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
2358 I believe under the rules that's
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
permitted that's just my opinion yes yes
 
00:25:07.389 --> 00:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
and right or wrong I just out of
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
courtesy mentioned it during my
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
testimony on 58 so okay so this hearing
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
moratorium that you have in place I
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
heard the word permanent and I've heard
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the question it is a
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.950 align:start position:0%
 
follow

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
up with a permanent
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
moratorium what does that do to a new
 
00:26:10.909 --> 00:26:10.919 align:start position:0%
charity that wants to get into uh
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and maybe
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
include uh
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
HHR uh they're been barred from it so
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
they're at a disadvantage from any other
 
00:26:24.909 --> 00:26:24.919 align:start position:0%
charitable organization from engaging in
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
that activity is that not
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
correct if you pass this that's correct
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
there would be a limit to the number of
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
facilities that could have uh historic
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
horse racing there would not be a limit
 
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
to the number of facilities that could
 
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
offer table games and poker uh and other
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming uh activities th those
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
would continue to be unlimited but yes
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
it would limit to the current 14 and
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
potentially the four additional
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
applicants the ability to have historic
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
hor racing follow up Mr chair follow up
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
follow up so you've got
 
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
these institutions that are holding
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and they've some of
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
them have HHR anyone who wants to put in
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
a new gaming facility would then uh a
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
new venue let's say would then be barred
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
from putting in
 
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
HHR and any
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
charity who wants to operate or to get
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
into the gaming activity at one of these
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
venues would be barred from using the
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
revenues of the HHR that are there
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
existing is that correct that's
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
correct that's the current law we have
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
we currently have a limit to 14 this
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
Ames well thank you for for raising the
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
question representative er um
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
and I think first I think we're straying
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit from this public hearing on
 
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.630 align:start position:0%
a little bit from this public hearing on
the

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
amendment this is the discussion we need
 
00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919 align:start position:0%
to have amongst ourselves but I do want
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
to say that nothing's permanent in this
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
legislative world we operate
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
in and um some of us on this committee
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
are on the gaming commission which has
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
at its charge this very subject of of um
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
competition and uh location of of uh of
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh Charities that can do
 
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
HHR and uh we're going to be addressing
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
that I welcome this amendment because
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't open the door to to the
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
world it allows time for the commission
 
00:28:53.509 --> 00:28:53.519 align:start position:0%
to think about this issue and maybe come
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
down exactly where this amendment brings
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
us to but maybe it comes down at a
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
different place I doubt that it will
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
come down with a wide open door to to
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
the anybody but it may set propose
 
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
limits and then it's up to the
 
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
legislature to adopt that in the
 
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.350 align:start position:0%
legislature to adopt that in the
meantime

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
meantime
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
this this uh new limitation will be in
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
place if it's adopted by us and by the
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
legislature until the legislature
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
decides to change that that's the way I
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
understand it I totally agree with your
 
00:29:29.549 --> 00:29:29.559 align:start position:0%
representative I I shouldn't have used
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
the word permanent obviously we know
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
that one legislature can't bind another
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
and you folks may decide next year or
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
the year after to make some modification
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
after the commission does its
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
work thank you thank you representative

line
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
26 um which apparently rephrases the
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
language langage that the Lottery
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
Commission was using to um not permit a
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
license granted to be transferred or
 
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.110 align:start position:0%
license granted to be transferred or
sold

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
sold
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh does that help in any way with the
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
chicanery that's been going on for the
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
last six eight months 12 months
 
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
whatever I I thank you and appreciate
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
the question uh repres resentative I'm
 
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
not sure if Lottery is prepared to and I
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
don't know whether attorney
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh what does the change in the language
 
00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:44.710 align:start position:0%
uh what does the change in the language
do

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
then yes represent this is not a change
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
in the language it's a move Mo move of
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions for
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative ducet yes I'm not sure
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
technically if it's for representative
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
ducet uh or just in general I want to
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
clarify that there
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
is nothing in any of our licensing
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
language that
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
requires New
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh owners potential owners to
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
be given favor over out of state or out
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
of country owners is that
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.070 align:start position:0%
of country owners is that
correct

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.350 align:start position:0%
correct
represent

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
duet uh I believe you're correct in that
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
and also and thank you for the question
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
and I believe that may be something that
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
the commission can take up and
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
um yeah I don't I don't think it negates
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
any citizen from applying for a business
 
00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it does not give them
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
favor over say someone from California
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
or that's not written in the statute
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of thank you thank you uh
 
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.230 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of thank you thank you uh

John are on their way they had a
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
different time on the calendar so if
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's something I can't answer they'll be
 
00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.870 align:start position:0%
it's something I can't answer they'll be
here

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
shortly Miss Valerie your last name
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
again King K
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
iing representative fellows yes I just
 
00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
wanted um a little brief description of
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
the states of the um steps in the
 
00:33:53.909 --> 00:33:53.919 align:start position:0%
application process you know is did they
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
fill out a paper and send it in and or
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
did they they have to go you know get
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
approved for this and step number one
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then step number two is looking at
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
something else related to the license
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about HHR specifically
 
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:14.149 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about HHR specifically
right

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so the first thing they would need
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
to have is their games of chance uh game
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
operator license and a facility one and
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
at the same time they'd also complete an
 
00:34:27.629 --> 00:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
application for a historic horse racing
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
what we do is we do have to determine
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
suitability first that's um something
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
that we do the leg work and then we send
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
it to the AG's office for their um
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
review and approval um if they're found
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
suitable then the next step we would do
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
is um we have to go visit the game room
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
itself and make sure it's ready for
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
operations we check that the machines
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
are set up that the cage operations are
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
ready and that they're ready to go we
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
don't issue the license until we feel
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
confident they are ready to go
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
live follow
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
up or you also so so do you know where
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
the the four that or so that are um in
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
in this Middle Ground they've applied do
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know where they are in the process
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
if or have they all gone to the AG's
 
00:35:20.359 --> 00:35:21.790 align:start position:0%

office

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
or I'm not sure exactly how much I can
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
disclose but um I can tell you that we
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
have applications at this
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
applications so they are they complete
 
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
information that was required to process
 
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:46.670 align:start position:0%
information that was required to process
their

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%

00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
I it it
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.230 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
representative Aly uh Mr chairman I
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
believe that we can't ask her to divulge
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
information she is not allowed to
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
divulge by the lottery
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
rules so we'll have to wait for
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
on on the head of the Lottery Commission
 
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg thank you Mr
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and representative aly's
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
brought up a good point point if the
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
investigation I'm sorry I should look at
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
you if the investigation of the
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
applicant has been
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
completed Mr McIntyre the
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
director uh when I asked him who they
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
confidential if it's been completed is
 
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
it still
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
confidential that's right have answered
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
that John or or Charlie can give you
 
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
because uh they're attorneys well all
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
right well maybe we we consider them as
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
far as I understand we consider them to
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
be confidential until the license is
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:14.839 align:start position:0%
is if if the director will be here while
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
we're still in the hearing that I would
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
like to have the rest of my question for
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
him to be addressed at that
 
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
time well what we can do we will um
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
we'll be having a exec session on this
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
um we can ask that question maybe I
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
should just give what I'm looking for
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
and then you can relay it and then the
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
information come back to us uh when Mr
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
McIntyre had uh said it was
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
confidential uh the governing statute is
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 287 DD uh games of chance and in
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
particular in in the above statute 287
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
D5 it deals with the application process
 
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.630 align:start position:0%
D5 it deals with the application process
and

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
87 287 d8 deals with specific related to
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
the game operator license which is the
 
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.230 align:start position:0%
the game operator license which is the
master

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
master
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
license that a gaming operator must have
 
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
it which you've I think expressed uh
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
before they get a historic racing
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
license and uh this was referenced I
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
think by representative du
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative du set
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
okay oh
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
well shall I wait for Mr McIntyre to
 
00:38:35.069 --> 00:38:35.079 align:start position:0%
maybe take this question I think that
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
sense and uh Miss King if you can um
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
card when you got a chance you can fill
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
out a pink card
 
00:38:54.309 --> 00:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
and all right um yes um director
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
McIntyre thank you for coming good good
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
committee uh Charlie McIntyre Lottery
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
director my apologies I thought this was
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
at 10:30 not 9:30 so I miscounted it
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
so may I call we do have we do have a
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
question for you from representative
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
shamber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
Mr McIntyre um you had mentioned in our
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
last meeting that the names on the list
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
were confidential
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
yes and I've done a little bit of
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
research since then is their names are
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
still confidential because they are
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
still being investigated in the
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
application process or is that process
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
over right
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
now so that we can get the list of
 
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
names uh before maybe we vote on this so
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
um the reason the names are confidential
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
is because there's a suitability review
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
during the application process we review
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
the individuals in question and decide
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
whether they're suitable or not so that
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
if they're determined unsuitable that
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
would be confidential as you could
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
imagine those reviews haven't I don't
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
believe it finished yet um yeah and
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
moreover the list actually is I was
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
informed that it's actually now five
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
locations not
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
four well followup Mr chairman follow
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
up well the reason I bring this up is
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
that the word confidential only appears
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
287-291 a which implies that everything
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
else is subject to 91a
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
in the ways and means testimony that you
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
gave you told me you could not release
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
the names because state law
 
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
prohibits you from doing so yeah and I'm
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
having a hard time just figuring this
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
out so I
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
guess certainly when are these names
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
ever going to be released when they are
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
approved for a license because if here's
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
the difficulty represent if I could sort
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
of phrase the question or phrase the
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
answer a different way if I tell you
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
names of the individuals that applied
 
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
and then they're not licensed the
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of that suitability is
 
00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
no longer valid because in essence you
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
know know that they weren't suitable for
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
some reason you can sort of think the
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
farious thoughts about it so that's the
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
difficulty in telling you who's applied
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
because if they then are not licensed
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
they were then found unsuitable which
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
would be inferior confidential
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
fact more the theory in fact
 
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
followup so Mr McIntyre then the only
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
people we're ever going to know who is
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
applied are those that are suitable and
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
the rest we never know who is applied at
 
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
the end of this process correct would be
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not as dissimilar from
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
think representative fellows yes so so
 
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
my questions are kind of related to this
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
application process it in the step the
 
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
um what we're looking at for an
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
amendment it
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
says that there's an exclusion for for
 
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:34.670 align:start position:0%
says that there's an exclusion for for
um

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
applicants entities that applied for a
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
license so my question is I don't know
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
how extensive the application is but I'm
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
wondering if somebody could have just
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
kind of like put in their name as a
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
placeholder as opposed to filling out
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
the complete application and if it's an
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
extensive application then that there
 
00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
to good morning um drn Cony Chief
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
compliance officer for the New Hampshire
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
lottery um the application itself is not
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
extensive however there are several um
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
requirements operational requirements uh
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
those types of documents
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh such as internal control surveillance
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
plans um game rules those types of
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
things that need to be completed um in
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
association with the application um so
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
I'm as you know we just we just walked
 
00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:44.839 align:start position:0%
in here I think if um you can have
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
submitted an
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
application um and it would not be
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
complete until all of those subsequent
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
documents would be um would be both
 
00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:56.839 align:start position:0%
submitted and and then reviewed viewed
 
00:43:59.950 --> 00:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
um and that typically happens closer to
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
um the uh time of
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
operation I don't know if that answered
 
00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:10.069 align:start position:0%
operation I don't know if that answered
your

00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
ready I would like to ask on in the
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
document that we are looking at and the
 
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
next one that's coming up uh it says
 
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
applied for game operator employer
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
license between January 1 23 and October
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
1823 that's 3 weeks ago um we're only
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
now learning that there's a fifth
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
one did they apply before the fif 18th
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
so representative Aly um I was informed
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
by staff this week that there had been
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
an application that had been submitted
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
in July that uh neither director
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
McIntyre or I were aware of uh because
 
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:26.440 align:start position:0%
it had not um progressed very
 
00:45:29.549 --> 00:45:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh far beyond the application stage um
 
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
but we just learned about that literally
 
00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.470 align:start position:0%
but we just learned about that literally
this

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
follow I well given that we were um made
 
00:45:46.349 --> 00:45:46.359 align:start position:0%
aware of that uh this week I did uh
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
inquire of our staff as to whether there
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
were any other pending applications or
 
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
things that could be pending um and that
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
was the only one that I was made aware
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
of thank thank you anything else yes
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
represent elberger thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify that there is no
 
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you uh there's no
 
00:46:10.589 --> 00:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity for any kind of public input
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
applications yeah that that is correct
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
there there is a um uh excuse me sorry I
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
didn't see where the question came from
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
um there is an a a review process that
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
involves the Lottery Commission and the
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office but um there
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
is not a public input uh component with
 
00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
respect to the gaming license there may
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
be with respect to any of the local
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
approvals that they may need to open an
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
establishment um but as far as our
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
licensing process there isn't a public
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
input component of that follow up
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
so being a suspicious type
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
if there is somebody who may have had
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
experience that's not public or publicly
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
known with a uh license someone who is a
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
license applicant and that information
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
might be Germaine to the decision as to
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
whether to support the license
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
application or not there's no way for
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
that person who might know something
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
that would be useful to get that
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
information to you
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
um they would not necessarily be aware
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
that um there would be an application
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
pending we do try to um on our own
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
initiative uh do as much investigation
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
and obviously the Department of Justice
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
does as well um to um obtain as much
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
information as we possibly can on a
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
prospective applicant but you're correct
 
00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
that um somebody would not necessarily
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
know and know to come to us um based on
 
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
Public Information thank you and and I
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
would think that that would be a
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
potential issue for all sorts of avenues
 
00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:05.559 align:start position:0%
where we depend on uh agencies to do the
 
00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
investigation representative PL just
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
point out to me the obvious if there
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
were a public input process would not NE
 
00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
confidentiality well
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
yes certainly the
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
process has to go for the town before
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
they finalize their licensed with us
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
they have to get approvals because we
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
have to know what it looks like what the
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
buildout is the surveillance cameras is
 
00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
compliance officer suggested so
 
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.309 align:start position:0%
compliance officer suggested so
um

00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
any any other uh questions comments I
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
do yes represent Southworth thank you
 
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just want to
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
double check um there's no problem with
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
eliminating the annual financial
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
statement it's redundant or there some
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
reason you don't need it
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
anymore um we we looked at that and
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
based on other uh requirements that we
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
have in the rules and uh both on the
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
historic course racing side and the
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
auditing rules that we have currently um
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
that that was really redundant
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
information at this point great thank
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
you uh yes representative ner thank you
 
00:49:21.309 --> 00:49:21.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um are we allowed to know
 
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
the locations of the
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
establishments we no
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
we haven't sort of notified folks
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
confidential thank you yes
 
00:49:36.789 --> 00:49:36.799 align:start position:0%
representative Lee
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
Lee thank you it seems that the
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
fundamental question is what is
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
confidential it seems like this I'm not
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
an attorney um I'm an average person
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
representing average people and an
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
average person reading this um law it
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
sounds like the protected inform
 
00:49:58.750 --> 00:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
information is the outcomes of the
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
criminal check and the background check
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand that an applicant
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
would have a right to apply in secrecy
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
why they wouldn't want people to know
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
that they're applying so it sounds a
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
little bit like there's been some creep
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the interpretation of the law I'm not
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
sure why applicants deserve secrecy in
 
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
this it it seems seems like we're
 
00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
talking about something
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's it doesn't seem like you would
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
need to maintain
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
your fact that you're applying as
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
confidential or the fact where this
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
might take place as confidential so I
 
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
guess my question
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
is how did you arrive at that
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the state law was that
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
your own was that the AG's
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
interpretation thank
 
00:50:54.789 --> 00:50:54.799 align:start position:0%
you well one of the difficulties in
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining conf confidential
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
information is that once you've released
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
it you no longer get to bring it back
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
you understand my point is if I released
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
the list and then I was found to be in
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
violation of that I violated the law
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
sought we haven't sought opinion to the
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
attorney general in this in this regard
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
specifically no only because it's come
 
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
up only in this
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
context it it really so for years
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
nobody's ever asked what the list looked
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
like and who was applied the only reason
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
is in this context of the moratorium and
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
these d in question but so let me re may
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
I restate my question so my question
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
is what do you understand to be
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
confidential it sounds to me like the
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
state law is protecting information the
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
information that's protected is the
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
results of the background check and
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
results of a criminal
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
check it doesn't sound like the list
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
itself or the identity of an applicant
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
itself is protected did it is that your
 
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law and how did
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
you arrive at your interpretation of the
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
law was it your own the the answer is
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes it's our interpretation of the law
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to review this with the
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office subsequent to
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
this but certainly our interpretation
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
only because the state usually balances

understanding we're happy to review this
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative ery this is addressed
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
to representative lefley having forly
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
held a private investigator's license
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
state and you can't find out who is or
 
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
is not a licensed private investigator
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
unless it directly uh involves you
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's a privacy restriction on that
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
particular license remember a license is
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
a grant to do something that is
 
00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:02.390 align:start position:0%
a grant to do something that is
otherwise

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
illegal there are several other licenses
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
that are granted by the state that are
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
confidential in order to protect both
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
the ly particularly in my case from
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
malicious activity
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh and to protect the public in general
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
so that they don't have a large number
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
of oh you do do this you do that granted
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
most private investigators want to
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
advertise but they'll advertise a
 
00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
business address rather than a personal
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
address and on a private investigator's
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
license they need to give the personal
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
address uh just that that type of
 
00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
activity so I understand where they're
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
coming from in the lottery and I I'm
 
00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
hoping that you can see how you can
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
translate that over to the lottery
 
00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
activity there is a question and the uh
 
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
regarding whether or not the public
 
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
should have input
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
as to the uh lenses uh suitability for
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
the project and I'm glad that we're
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
going to check that out with the
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general and follow up Mr chair
 
00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
follow up and
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh Mr McIntyre
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to put in a facility
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
they still have to uh go to a public
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
Hearing in the town in which the
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
facility wishes to behave and there's
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
ample time at that point for the the
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
public in general to make a uh a
 
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:30.760 align:start position:0%
protestation of one type or another is
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
that correct um actually to follow up on
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative um there's even more
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
input than that each city or town is
 
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:41.559 align:start position:0%
certainly free to Zone as it sees fit to
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
where the activity would best be suited
 
00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:45.799 align:start position:0%
for the town a number of jurisdictions
 
00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
have zoned in this activity to certain
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
areas within the town so not only do
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
they have their rights during the
 
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
hearing process for permitting and
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
Zoning that the town itself has a right
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
to vote saying it belongs in Industry a
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
or business whatever a number of towns
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
have done that so um there's more than
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
that that that type of input thank you
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative Aly
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
thank you isn't it true that the town
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
has almost no rights of control over
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
that that casino and that on the zoning
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
has to be done before the IDE a that a
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
casino might be interested in your town
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
shows up because at that point they have
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
in I I would say yes representative Aly
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
they have obviously anyone who applies
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
for a um a building permit or other um
 
00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
uh permit or application through the
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
town has the same rights um that any
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
other business would have um I think to
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre's point point that um
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the town or city where this would be
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
going in would have oversight over over
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
the casino only to the extent um that
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
they would have oversight over any other
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
business in that's applying for a
 
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
similar license so with respect to the
 
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
gaming portion of it they would only
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
have that sort of right um to restrict
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh through zoning which they many have
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
done um and are continuing to do as
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
gaming is now now expanded and and the
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh potential for uh a gaming
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
establishment to come into a
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
municipality is is growing um so a
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
number of the municipalities are
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
addressing that um before um an
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
forward okay uh representative elberger
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
chairman can a community simply say we
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
we're not going to allow gaming here no
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
if you've approved a
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.750 align:start position:0%
if you've approved a
license

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
sort of prior to operation we would seek
 
00:57:01.029 --> 00:57:01.039 align:start position:0%
the town's approval the town would the
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
operator itself would seek the town's
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
approval to begin operation um I don't
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
want to get too into this because there
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
are certain communities that are
 
00:57:11.789 --> 00:57:11.799 align:start position:0%
opposing facilities currently and I
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak to it because I
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
don't you know there may be litigation
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
but certainly the town has its rights
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
regarding zoning and permitting to
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
approve the activity or
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
not as relates to zoning of permitting
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
they're silent on the issue of gaming
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult question right just
 
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up not not a question
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
but more a statement so a community
 
00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to say no and
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
before the process has gotten very far
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
down the
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
road nobody knows who's applying for a
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
where well with respect to again with
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
respect to the town or city it the the
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
process is the same as it would be for a
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
restaurant or a bar um so they would
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
have to initiate those processes and um
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre is a lot smarter than
 
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
I am I am not an expert on local zoning
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
uh laws I'm barely uh you know
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
conversing on the things I'm supposed to
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
be conversing on so I can't um I can't
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
tell you what that process looks like
 
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
for a town or city um but certainly they
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
would have the same insight into that
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
business activity that they would with
 
00:58:31.029 --> 00:58:31.039 align:start position:0%
respect to every other business activity
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
but with respect to our licensing you
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
are correct they would not have insight
 
00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:38.710 align:start position:0%
are correct they would not have insight
into

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
that okay seeing no more questions
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
we'll thank you very
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
much is there anyone else who hasn't uh
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
testify okay seeing none we'll end this
 
00:58:55.039 --> 00:59:23.630 align:start position:0%
testify okay seeing none we'll end this
public

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:40.829 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
all right the time being uh
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
10:28 uh we will start the work session
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
on HB 1221 relative to worldwide
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%

does anyone have any comments uh yes
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury thank you Mr
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%

01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:27.799 align:start position:0%
report you was an extensive report 16
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
page uh Minority Report there were seven
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
U Commissioners and six um adopted that
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
report uh there was a qualifying
 
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
statement um from the association the
 
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
Society of CPAs and uh the Dr that they
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
were neutral on the recommendation but
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
endorsed the report there's a Minority
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
Report from representative
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
shamberg uh minutes
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
and uh a bibliography all of which is
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
posted on the general Court's uh website
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
on a page dedicated to the commission
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
and accessible with links and citations
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
and so on so it's a lot to have read I I
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
hope most of you have had a chance to
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
read it um I'm not going to uh get into
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
reciting the report because it's very
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
involved very complicated subject and uh
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
I would say if you haven't read it yet
 
01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:27.039 align:start position:0%
the first first eight pages are a very
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh neutral measured recitation of uh all
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
of the positions and opinions that the
 
01:01:33.559 --> 01:01:34.990 align:start position:0%
of the positions and opinions that the
commission

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
heard uh and you can jump to the
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
findings if you don't want to Wade
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
through that detail the findings
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
analysis and recommendation can be read
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
in several pages so
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
succinctly the commission recommends
 
01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire does not Implement
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
combined worldwide report
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
reporting and that it rests with the
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
wat's edge limitation currently in
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
statute therefore the commission
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
recommends that uh
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
hb11 is not um moved
 
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
forward and the commission took uh makes
 
01:02:17.309 --> 01:02:17.319 align:start position:0%
a second recommendation that there is no
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
need for further study at this time but
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
there are conditions that uh maybe worth
 
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring and could change change the
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
environment in coming years particularly
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
if the federal government um takes a
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
different stance So currently our law
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
aligns with the Internal Revenue
 
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:41.559 align:start position:0%
code currently the bottom line on a
 
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
business's federal tax return is the
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
point of departure for a New Hampshire
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh return and if HB 1221 was to be
 
01:02:54.589 --> 01:02:54.599 align:start position:0%
adopted it would completely delink link
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
us from the federal IRC it would require
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
multinational businesses to prepare an
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
entirely different uh sort of tax return
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
and we would lose all of the benefits of
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
um piggybacking off of the federal code
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
we would also lose all of the positive
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
impact of the massive audit work done by
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
the Internal Revenue Service that the
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Revenue
 
01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.029 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Revenue
Administration

01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
is not equipped to do so I'll leave it
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
there uh and glad to answer any
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
questions representative PL yes
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury are there any
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
other states using worldwide
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
reporting no um the answer is no there
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
were about I think it was 11 states that
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
adopted combined worldwide reporting in
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
the late 70s and early 80s at new
 
01:03:56.710 --> 01:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was one of those in
 
01:03:59.870 --> 01:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
1981 and that regime although on the
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
books was never applied to foreign-based
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
multinationals creating an
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily discriminatory system
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
where the US multinationals were
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
burdened in a way that the foreign
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
multinationals were not and as a result
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
of that as well as a policy review and
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
pressure from the federal government in
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
regards to international relations uh
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
state of New apire repealed combined
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting in
 
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
1986 and by about that time all of the
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
states that had enacted it also repealed
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
it so we've now been about 40 years
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
nearly with no State um implementing
 
01:04:39.079 --> 01:04:41.789 align:start position:0%
nearly with no State um implementing
this

01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
regime I'll just ask um how did the vote
 
01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:46.839 align:start position:0%
from the commission go what was the vote
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
question yes question do um
 
01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:04.230 align:start position:0%
question yes question do um
representative

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
a I guess this is in part an
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
observation um I believe it's true that
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
there are several states that has H have
 
01:05:14.359 --> 01:05:15.349 align:start position:0%
there are several states that has H have
an

01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
option that uh
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
Corporation a taxpayer can uh Avail
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
themselves of which is is to use
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting instead of
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
the other system that that State uh
 
01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
defaults to and uh so California for
 
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
example I believe Massachusetts I could
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
be wrong on that and a few others um
 
01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
have that option and in fact many
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
corporations or some corporations I
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
don't have detail are using it uh so in
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
response to to the question about use of
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
worldwide combin reporting it is being
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
used in some places so that that's a
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
very worthwhile clarification thank you
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
for it there is no state that mandates
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
corre there are a handful of states or
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
less that allow an
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
option interestingly the state of Maine
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
has just gone through a study and um
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
issued a report in August that
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
specifically reviewed the
 
01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
proposal of going to the option and they
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
decided against
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
it and they their their evaluation was
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
that there was no benefit to the state
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
of offering the option because it simply
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
created a situation where a corporation
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
would elect whichever method was more
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
itself yes representative uh elberger
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I can't picture
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
any corporation that wouldn't choose to
 
01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
take the option that was most
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
financially beneficial to them I mean
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
all of us would do that in our own
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
private lives uh I am concerned about
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
that in a state where we believe that
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
people should have the ability
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
to should have equal options
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
to run their lives run their businesses
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
that this commission is coming out and
 
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
saying that we are more than willing to
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
allow foreign-based companies to have an
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
advantage over our own New Hampshire
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
based companies it it's it's a it kind
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
of boggles the mind that we are not
 
01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
saying that our local companies don't
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
have at least the same uh opportunities
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
for tax uh advantages or disadvantages
 
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
as those that are based in other
 
01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
countries thank
 
01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:06.760 align:start position:0%
you repres representative spillsbury um
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
yes so interesting observations the
 
01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:11.799 align:start position:0%
representative Elber I think there's two
 
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:13.160 align:start position:0%
different points you're making that I'd
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
like to respond
 
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
to first I I think it is worth
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
noting that in a state where if if we
 
01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
were to allow the
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
option there are as representative Ames
 
01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
pointed out multinationals that elect
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
reporting and that's a very interesting
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
thing to note because it tells you that
 
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.189 align:start position:0%
thing to note because it tells you that
the

01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
assumption that mandating worldwide
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
combined reporting will necessarily be
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the state IE will
 
01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily raise more taxes is faulty
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
the way worldwide combined reporting
 
01:08:59.630 --> 01:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
works in the briefest possible way is a
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
corporation is required to expand the
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
tax base they report to include all
 
01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:10.359 align:start position:0%
foreign operations subsidiaries of
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
American based
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
multinationals Affiliates Upstream
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
Downstream and parent of foreign uh
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
corporations but when you've expanded
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
the base that doesn't mean you're going
 
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
to get more in taxes it just means that
 
01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.470 align:start position:0%
to get more in taxes it just means that
the

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
equation where you take the portion
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
alloc allocable to New
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over the overall
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
activity is going to have a larger
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
denominator and a vastly watered down
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
numerator so whether you're going to end
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
up having more tax revenue is going to
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
depend on whether that particular
 
01:09:53.199 --> 01:09:54.910 align:start position:0%
depend on whether that particular
corporation

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
had a higher rate of
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
profit with their activities inside the
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
United States or whether they had a
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
higher rate of profit with their
 
01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.750 align:start position:0%
higher rate of profit with their
activities

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and there will be winners and
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
losers it will be completely
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
unpredictable a corporation that may pay
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
more taxes this year may pay less taxes
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
another year so it's a
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
clue that where an election is
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
allowed there are multin corporations
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
that elect worldwide combined reporting
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
and that's because it's just as likely
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
to be a tax advantage to them and a
 
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
revenue disadvantage to the state so it
 
01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
is it's just a completely faulty
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
premise that expanding the base will
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
result in Greater tax revenue that this
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
the second
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
part of what you're talking about is the
 
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:55.110 align:start position:0%
part of what you're talking about is the
disadvantage

01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of tax rules that we
 
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
deploy depreciation allowances and so on
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh that you can qualify for if you
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
invest you don't qualify if you don't
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
invest it's not a it's not a
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
discriminatory system that some people
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of depreciation
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
allowances and others aren't in that
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
situation this is very similar it's not
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
discriminatory first of all the law
 
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
treats a United states-based
 
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
multinational exactly the same way it
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
treats a foreign-based
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
multinational so any Corporation dealing
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
in multinational activities is treated
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
exactly alike under the
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
law the argument I think you may be
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
zeroing in on is whether there's a
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
perceived disadvantage to a
 
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:48.280 align:start position:0%
purely domestic
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
Corporation maybe the ultimate example
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
would be a business that only does
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:11:57.149 --> 01:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
and doesn't even do business in another
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
state but that's a that's a business
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
that 5 years from now could grow and
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
start doing business in other states
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's a business that could start doing
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
business in Europe tomorrow so
 
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
businesses aren't static businesses
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
choose how broadly um they want to
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
compete and they're not static so I I I
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
think it's also a faulty premise that
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
there is a discriminatory aspect of the
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
law there are different outcomes there
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
differential circumstances but the law
 
01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.750 align:start position:0%
differential circumstances but the law
is

01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
even-handed thank you representative
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you I have a little bit of
 
01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
problem with your
 
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
description of what
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
happened in the
 
01:12:43.199 --> 01:12:45.310 align:start position:0%
happened in the
80s

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
80s
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
because on
 
01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
we on during the on coid worst of the
 
01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
coid pandemic on we had a uh Zoom
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
meeting for several hours with the
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
proponents of worldwide combined
 
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
reporting and one of them was the
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
successor of the man that first
 
01:13:14.669 --> 01:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
developed combined reporting
 
01:13:14.679 --> 01:13:16.390 align:start position:0%
developed combined reporting
for

01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.910 align:start position:0%
for
multi-state

01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
multi-state
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
work on they did that in California
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
because um the film industry was making
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh was avoiding a lot of taxes
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
by um filming one copy of their films
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
and sending them for
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
$5 to um another state which didn't have
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
a tax on the film industry and um where
 
01:13:50.669 --> 01:13:50.679 align:start position:0%
they were multiplied and sent all over
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
the country um tax fre um
 
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.669 align:start position:0%
the country um tax fre um
and

01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
on he this gentleman
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
was I think almost 90 he may be dead now
 
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
but on he pointed out that uh they
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
started doing this across they they set
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
up this s situation in
 
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
California uh for the other states and
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
then they started later on to think
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
about doing it
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
internationally and they did on
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
Implement on worldwide combined
 
01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:35.110 align:start position:0%
Implement on worldwide combined
reporting

01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
internationally for at least some period
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
he mentioned that uh the greatest
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
problem that they'd had in terms of the
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
work for their on tax agency was that
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
they'd had to send one person to
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
Japan to uh audit
 
01:14:55.719 --> 01:14:57.270 align:start position:0%
Japan to uh audit
something

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
and uh but that in general all of these
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
companies overseas were used to working
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
in English and so they were able to do
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
most most of it by probably in those
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
days air
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
mail so so
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
um there was uh there were apparently a
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
number of states also that were
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
implementing this with not as an option
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
but as a requirement but it may not have
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
gotten too far before Margaret Thatcher
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
got uh Ronald Reagan to lean on all of
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
the states that were doing it and tell
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
them not to do it
 
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
anymore so so just just to clarify the
 
01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
um it's correct that when New Hampshire
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
first instituted the BPT in
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
1970 we used a separate filing mechanism
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
just like the IRS
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
does and it's also true that we
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
enacted worldwide combined reporting in
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
1981 it's not accurate that we ever
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
implemented it so and and and so I did I
 
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
did indicate before there were I believe
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
11 states that also enacted it and all
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
repealed it none of them still has it so
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think it was
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
misstated representative PL yes another
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
question for representative spillsbury
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
there are certain States you say who
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
will give a choice of worldwide
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
reporting of Water's
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
Edge and as a result of that the
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
businesses will choose one or the other
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
depending on what's favorable to that
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
business if that's true if we were to
 
01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.990 align:start position:0%
business if that's true if we were to
mandate

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
here uh we we it's a crapshoot whether
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
revenues would go up or down isn't it
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
because a business could be paying more
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
under the water's edge than they would
 
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
have worldwide reporting is that correct
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
that is correct it's it's
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
unable which taxpayers would see their
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
tax liability increase and which ones
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
decrease representative
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah this
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh experience that's uh clearly happened
 
01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
in states where the election the option
 
01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.270 align:start position:0%
in states where the election the option
is

01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.350 align:start position:0%
is
available

01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
um should uh be an experience that would
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
be help help all of
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
us understand um the re realities of
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting not
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
mandated it but some
 
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
corporations large small I don't know
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
um are choosing to put
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
forward um their calculation of their
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
tax liability using this accounting
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
method and um those
 
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
States these tax departments in those
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
states have had to respond to that
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
either accepted or uh audit it or U
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
whatever and that experience I would
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
think would be very
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
interesting um and
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
including um any information that's
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
available about uh which way these
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
corporations go and how that relates to
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
revenue the the must be information out
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
there that would be helpful I'm my
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
question is whether this commission
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
looked at all to those States for
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
information on uh that experience I I
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
think that's a very constructive
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
question and the the answer is we took
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
cognizance of them but we did not do
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
research into what their experience is
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
and so the commission um has stated
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
nothing to that point however um we we
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
did specifically consider the recent
 
01:19:15.239 --> 01:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
did specifically consider the recent
main

01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
main
 
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
study and the one I referred to before
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
which uh came out in August and that is
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
in our record and accessible through the
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
commission's web page and might be worth
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
reading so they did evaluate
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
specifically that question and and just
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
I think you said it before but the
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
conclusion of that was what so the
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the state of Maine was to
 
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
not um to not adopt the options so they
 
01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
they continue to be a Water's Edge State
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
like we are uh I'm going to give you a
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
different example there are a number of
 
01:19:58.110 --> 01:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
states in the last half dozen years that
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
have considered and declined to go
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
forward Indiana in 2017 issued a very
 
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
extensive report in which they said that
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
they could imagine there would be a
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
moderate uh uptick in Revenue in the
 
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
first couple of years that would resolve
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
towards a net zero um and that it just
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't worth
 
01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
doing there uh there was a proposal in
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
inota this past year that was adopted in
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
the uh passed in the Minnesota house and
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
died in the Senate did not get
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
enacted um also very interesting is that
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island within the past year has
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
concluded a study with about a 90 page
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
report very detailed it's a different
 
01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance but it tells us a
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
lot Rhode Island uses separate
 
01:20:51.629 --> 01:20:51.639 align:start position:0%
filing they've never adopted combined
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
filing either on the water's edge limit
 
01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.030 align:start position:0%
filing either on the water's edge limit
or

01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
worldwide so they studied the question
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
whether they should move to combined
 
01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
reporting and they concluded that they
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to stay separate reporting in in
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
line with the IRS so I won't
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
characterize their study but 90 pages in
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of detail and they weren't even
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
edge thank you we're willing to go to
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
Water's Edge Rhode Island decided to
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
leave their law as it is now which is
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
separate filing rather than
 
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you um so I have two items
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
um my first question is about the makeup
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
of the commission um it seems like it
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
was very small and it seems like it
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't um entirely representative of
 
01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
people who might have an interest in
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
this item can you talk a little bit
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
commission so the commission of course
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
was dictated by hb12 and acted in 2022
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
and it described 12
 
01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.990 align:start position:0%
and it described 12
members

01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
and seven of those appointments were
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
filled five were never appointed
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
despite repeated requests initially by
 
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative abrami when he was first
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
seated as chair and then further renewed
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
by me several times during this summer
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
so both of us uh through the house clerk
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
Paul Smith made an effort to try and Jog
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
the other uh listed interests so that
 
01:22:45.639 --> 01:22:47.149 align:start position:0%
the other uh listed interests so that
for

01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
example the
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
um Department of uh uh economics and
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
development is that what it's called DEA
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
Taylor caswell's department had a member
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
he left the department and they did not
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
um fill that vacancy the Attorney
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
General did not make an appointment and
 
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of other um Bia
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
positions two of them that were never
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
filled um but I will I will tell you
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
representative leapley that we went out
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
of our way
 
01:23:26.189 --> 01:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we heard from
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
everybody who indicated an interest in
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh in in speaking before
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
us we also went out of our way to
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
structure the hearing so that the New
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based interests were up first
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
and had an opportunity to frame the
 
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
issue and uh I referred to that in the
 
01:23:50.189 --> 01:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
commission's report as New Hampshire
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
Centric we wanted to put them up up on
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
the platform and uh let their opinion be
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
centered first so we certainly did try
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
uh to hear and and and nobody who
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
indicated an interest in in presenting
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
to us was turned
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
away I have a followup followup thank
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
you uh I certainly appreciate the
 
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
commission's work I certainly appreciate
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
your work um it was very serious and I
 
01:24:22.669 --> 01:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
know time consuming so thank thank you
 
01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
for that um I want to talk about framing
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
the issue because I feel like that's
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
really key here um we've addressed the
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
Assumption um it seems that what was
 
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
framed here is the assumption that
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
um this would necessarily raise more
 
01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
taxes and that that assumption um was
 
01:24:53.790 --> 01:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
found to be false I don't think that was
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
the central
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
Focus I think it's an important focus of
 
01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:01.400 align:start position:0%
this commission but I think an equally
 
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
important focus of the commission is tax
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
Justice and
 
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
fairness and so I think it's it might be
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
slightly misleading
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
to frame this as you want to raise more
 
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
taxes this doesn't do that and therefore
 
01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
we should not pass it um I think a
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
question that's that's equally important
 
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
is the fairness question and we don't
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
know doesn't equal it won't and I feel
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
like almost everything we do in this
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee is often there's a lot that we
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
don't know about how changing taxes will
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
affect revenues so I think that that's
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
not particularly different or special in
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
this case um there were some things that
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
were raised that I actually read as
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
opposite at of the commission for
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
example um there was a lobbyist that
 
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719 align:start position:0%
shared the information that 14% there
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
was a 14% growth in international thanks
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
to International or foreign
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
multinationals in the state there was a
 
01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
14 um% increase in employment by those
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
firms whereas the rest of the economy
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
only grew 7% and therefore this is a
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
very important base um of taxpayers that
 
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
we should treat carefully and my take
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
away from that is if they're growing
 
01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
their employment by
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
14% everybody else is Growing Up by
 
01:26:45.590 --> 01:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
7% I want to make extra sure that
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
they're paying their fair share of taxes
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
so that we can develop a Workforce if
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
they're drawing on our Workforce
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
disproportionately it makes sense that
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
they pay their fair share of taxes right
 
01:26:59.470 --> 01:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
so yes it's a benefit it's wonderful
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
that they're generating employment it
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
costs the state money to educate people
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
so I I don't necessarily have the same
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
takeaway um on some of these issues
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
another point that was made in the
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
commission study um by someone who
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
presented was that New
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're actually doing a great
 
01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:22.629 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're actually doing a great
job

01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
of corporate taxation because we have
 
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
the biggest percentage um of our income
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
is coming from taxing corporations so
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
we're doing great so we shouldn't tax
 
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
them any further um and my takeaway from
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
from that point was that again if this
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
is the biggest part of our taxation we
 
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
need to be extra sure that we're taxing
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
corporations fairly because we have a
 
01:27:49.199 --> 01:27:50.590 align:start position:0%
corporations fairly because we have a
greater

01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
greater
 
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
interest greater than any other state in
 
01:27:58.270 --> 01:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
the outcome of that taxation so again I
 
01:27:59.790 --> 01:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that that's a oh we
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
better take our hands off I think we
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
better be extra careful that we're
 
01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
better be extra careful that we're
taxing

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
taxing
 
01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.790 align:start position:0%
taxing
fairly

01:28:06.790 --> 01:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
um a third point is that we're talking
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
about picking winners or losers and we
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to pick winners or
 
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
losers the it's ironic in the Deep sense
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
of irony um because this bill was
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
brought forward because the argument is
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
that the state is picking winners and
 
01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
losers currently and we would like to
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
stop doing that and I think the argument
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
that the law is not discriminatory that
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
we treat all multinationals the same is
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
missing the
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
point we're not talking about
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
multinationals not being treated equally
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people who just
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
exist in New Hampshire who don't exist
 
01:28:50.510 --> 01:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
multinationally who are not taking
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of these very expensive
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
sophisticated accounting techniques to
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
avoid taxation they're paying taxation
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
that that we should proceed carefully
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
and in you know deciding that we're
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
we're treating all of them the same my
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
final point is the commission report um
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
seemed to claim that there was no proof
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
that there is tax avoidance going on
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
whereas the
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
oecd which I think is a pretty credible
 
01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:31.189 align:start position:0%
oecd which I think is a pretty credible
um

01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
International body of over 140 qu uh
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
countries says that there are billions
 
01:29:41.470 --> 01:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
and billions and billions of dollars
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
that are not being taxed so I think this
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
is a real problem um it's a real problem
 
01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is interested in more
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
interested in than others States so I
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to to be dismissive of this
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
very difficult question I think the
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
commission did a great job um I think
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
this is worthy of further consideration
 
01:30:10.229 --> 01:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
and I think it is worthy of being
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
discussed by our legislature because we
 
01:30:16.470 --> 01:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
have a bigger interest in this than any
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
other state in the country thank you
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
um I saw uh representative um PL first
 
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair um repres
 
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
spillsbury you stated that you gave New
 
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:34.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Centric business's first
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity but at the Apple did you
 
01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
find any support for New Hampshire from
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses for worldwide
 
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
reporting yes there there are definitely
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
Advocates and we had a representative of
 
01:30:52.510 --> 01:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
a Business Association um with two other
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
uh people with him and they made a
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
passionate case in favor of worldwide
 
01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
combined reporting so yes we did hear
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
that but that doesn't mean that it was a
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
fact-based case or that it was a
 
01:31:09.629 --> 01:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
quantifiable case it was a theoretical
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
case if if yes thank you m Mr chair uh
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
would you not expect if New Hampshire
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
businesses thought that worldwide
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
reporting would raise taxes for people
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
out out side uh New
 
01:31:27.430 --> 01:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that that they'd be supported
 
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
as a competitive
 
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
Advantage because they won't pay it but
 
01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.270 align:start position:0%
Advantage because they won't pay it but
others

01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
will let me make sure I understood what
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
you asked did you you just asked if I
 
01:31:43.109 --> 01:31:43.119 align:start position:0%
thought more Revenue could be derived
 
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
from foreign multinationals would
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
not New Hampshire businesses be urging
 
01:31:50.109 --> 01:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
that we move in that direction is that
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
what you asked there's a competitive
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
Advantage because they screwing the
 
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.109 align:start position:0%
Advantage because they screwing the
other

01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
guys well perhaps I I I will just say I
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
was surprised that there wasn't more
 
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
uptake um and uh more businesses that
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
came forward and wanted to uh give us
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
some at least anecdotes um I'd like to
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
give credit to representative leapley
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
who attended two of our very long
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
sessions including the all day of
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
hearings um she's obviously deeply
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
interested so if I could take another
 
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes just to address
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
distilling the various points you've
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
made you're concerned with
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
fairness and I want to be very
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
clear the
 
01:32:42.669 --> 01:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
commission did not state that there is
 
01:32:42.679 --> 01:32:43.669 align:start position:0%
commission did not state that there is
no

01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
problem the commission went out of its
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
way to explicitly
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the
 
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity and the
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
potential for misusing transfer uh
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
pricing uh techniques allowable
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
justifiable techniques that may be used
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
specifically to shift profit to a lower
 
01:33:11.310 --> 01:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
tax jurisdiction overseas that
 
01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity there's no question it
 
01:33:16.910 --> 01:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
exists there is no question that it's
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
used the
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
problem is that the problem is several
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
the problem is number one it's not
 
01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
quantifiable and any efforts to quantify
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
it can be very effectively um
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
rebutted second it's not clear how
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
extensive it is or whether it represents
 
01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:43.880 align:start position:0%
a truly material problem for the state
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of our goal
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
of generating
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue number three it is drastic ially
 
01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:52.910 align:start position:0%
Revenue number three it is drastic ially
over

01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
Brad it basically takes a concern that
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
certain taxpayers are using transfer
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
pricing let's say to shift profits on
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
the basis of licenses or royalties or
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know other um payments for
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
intellectual property and
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
intangibles um and it says okay so
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
here's the solution we're going to
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
require you and and everybody you're
 
01:34:22.679 --> 01:34:23.750 align:start position:0%
require you and and everybody you're
related

01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:34:28.590 --> 01:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
to to declare all of your worldwide
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
activity and your profits in every
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
country I used to work for a
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
multinational that was in 76
 
01:34:37.229 --> 01:34:37.239 align:start position:0%
countries so that Corporation would have
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
to file its uh its activities it's uh
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
basically translate its tax returns from
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
foreign currencies and foreign languages
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
and foreign General accepted accounting
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
practices and it
 
01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.709 align:start position:0%
practices and it
is

01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:34:54.719 --> 01:34:56.510 align:start position:0%
is
drastically

01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
drastically
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
underestimated what kind of a burden
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
this is going to place on the taxpayers
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
it is dras drastically underestimated
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
and not understood what kind of a
 
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
challenge this would place on the
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
Dr so I think that if this was perceived
 
01:35:15.119 --> 01:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
Dr so I think that if this was perceived
as

01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
being the right solution to the
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
perception that there
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
is a fairness
 
01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
problem we would create far more
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
problems than we
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
solve and you've got to really ask
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
yourself why is it after decades and
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
Decades of controversy that the US
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
Congress has never tried to implement
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
something like this if the United States
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
government doesn't think it's worth
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
going after in this p in this fashion
 
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
then how in the world is New Hampshire
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to effectively move in that
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
direction on its own and what do we give
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
up when we dink from the IRS and from
 
01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
from the uh from the code
 
01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:04.670 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
01:36:04.670 --> 01:36:06.950 align:start position:0%

solution are not even slightly in
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
alignment with the description of the

Mr
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
chair um having been on the commission
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
and attended the uh at least this year's
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh sessions of it a couple of uh things
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
came to mind the question regarding
 
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
fairness treatment of Taxation was
 
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.070 align:start position:0%
fairness treatment of Taxation was
raised

01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
repeatedly and if I'm not mistaken uh
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
one of the comments was that the same
 
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
tax code applies to every person in the
 
01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.070 align:start position:0%
tax code applies to every person in the
state

01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
currently there is a difference in
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
magnitude of scale on some of the
 
01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
corporations to be sure and that's going
 
01:37:03.390 --> 01:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
to happen regardless of what kind of
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
system is put in place magnitud
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
scale there was also a discussion as to
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not the ver what the tax
 
01:37:14.790 --> 01:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
Foundation rates New Hampshire I think
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
is number six uh Rich States poor states
 
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
has it uh New Hampshire in the top 20 uh
 
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
for the business environments uh that
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
question was also raised as to whether
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
or not it would have a adverse effect
 
01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
upon businesses particularly large
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:37:37.229 --> 01:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
that rely on high-tech New Hampshire has
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
become a high-tech environment um we've
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
got some stuff in this uh uh immediate
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
area that uh really causes people to
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
take pause uh as to where they're going
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
because of its proximity to Boston
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
because of the tax environment that
 
01:37:57.870 --> 01:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
exists for the
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
corporations so if the fairness is do
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
are we going to trade
 
01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
off employing people in the state
 
01:38:09.229 --> 01:38:09.239 align:start position:0%
increasing Revenue uh from the BET BPT
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
which is applied equally to every single
 
01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:14.679 align:start position:0%
business I believe um Mr Kean was there
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
and made that uh uh comment to that
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
effect then we have the question about
 
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh what what is it um um price transfer
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
which is take the technical term for
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
moving from place to place monies of
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
course that takes place most businesses
 
01:38:35.950 --> 01:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire do it all the time
 
01:38:39.550 --> 01:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
large or small and I believe the report
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
that was created said that it does take
 
01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
place but as to the degree whether or
 
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
not this was hiding profits from
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
taxation or merely uh taking profits
 
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
from one business here and giving it to
 
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
another business over there not for the
 
01:38:59.550 --> 01:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
purpose of hiding
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
profits like a greedy Rich business
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
would do but to help another division of
 
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
the same company be more successful hire
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
people and produce a product a good or
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
something or services that people want
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I I that was pretty clear stated if
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken in our
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
um um report is that
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
correct well yes and I think those are
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
extremely valid points for those who've
 
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
had a chance to read the report yes
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see that that's very clearly
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
stated so for those who haven't had a
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
chance to read the report I'd like to
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
just say
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
categorically transfer pricing is
 
01:39:49.709 --> 01:39:49.719 align:start position:0%
legitimate it's necessary it's actually
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
required so so the question isn't
 
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
whether transfer pricing is inherently
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
bad the question is whether transfer
 
01:39:59.950 --> 01:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
pricing is used by certain people to
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
minimize or reduce
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
tax um I give you an
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
analogy if a parent owns a patent on a
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
recipe they're going to charge their
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries for the use of the recipe
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
right a parallel um instead of thinking
 
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of complicated multinational
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
businesses think of a franchise
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
operation if a franchisor has franchises
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
around the country and some franchisee
 
01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
has a dozen Subways uh that franchis
 
01:40:37.239 --> 01:40:38.430 align:start position:0%
has a dozen Subways uh that franchis
under

01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
contract agrees to pay for the
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
recipes the brand name the marketing
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
program and so on so inherently you're
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
going to to have
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries making payments to a parent
 
01:40:58.229 --> 01:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
for the use of those intellectual
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
property and other intangible assets
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
that the parent owns that's what
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
bad representative
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you I'm kind of appalled and
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was uh too sick during a
 
01:41:20.189 --> 01:41:20.199 align:start position:0%
large part of of the work that you were
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
doing to
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
and then too busy to be able to show up
 
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
and um there there is
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
substantial data on tax Havens around
 
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
the world that is something that is not
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
something that is uh just
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
transferring profits for for the
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
purposes of this SU ESS of the business
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
except to reduce their taxes there are a
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
large number of corporations that have
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
been shown to pay almost nothing to the
 
01:42:06.189 --> 01:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance of our federal government
 
01:42:10.510 --> 01:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
because they are using a lot of these
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
mechanisms um and there are several
 
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
there were several studies done
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
on on before we started getting into
 
01:42:23.199 --> 01:42:24.030 align:start position:0%
on on before we started getting into
this

01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
business uh that
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
showed on quantitatively that there
 
01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
would be an increase in New Hampshire
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
tax revenue if um if we could figure out
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
how to do this and there are other
 
01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:46.270 align:start position:0%
how to do this and there are other
reasons

01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
why we may need to do a bunch more work
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
on how how to to get it done but to
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
abandon the entire principle because all
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
of this tax evasion is going on
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
internationally on is seems to me to be
 
01:43:06.639 --> 01:43:08.709 align:start position:0%
internationally on is seems to me to be
um

01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
you yes represent yeah one thing I'd
 
01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
like to promise all of my colleagues on
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
the ways and mean committee is that the
 
01:43:25.109 --> 01:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
commission did not proceed in an
 
01:43:25.119 --> 01:43:26.589 align:start position:0%
commission did not proceed in an
ideological

01:43:26.589 --> 01:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
ideological
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
way uh there was no preconceived
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
conclusions it was an extraordinarily
 
01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and balanced review and
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
you'll see that when you read the
 
01:43:35.599 --> 01:43:37.990 align:start position:0%
you'll see that when you read the
commission's

01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
commission's
 
01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
report the I think most of your
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
observations are
 
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
accurate and and so in no way did the
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
Commission in its report try to pretend
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't happen but it's an
 
01:43:55.990 --> 01:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
international problem it's a problem
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
that the IRS deals with it's a problem
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
that Congress has considered from time
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
to time it's a problem that's been
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
addressed in a host of different ways
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
through our work with the organization
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
of economic cooperation and development
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
oecd the pillar one and pillar
 
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
two there were major aspects of the 2017
 
01:44:20.189 --> 01:44:20.199 align:start position:0%
tax cuts and jobs act that focused on
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
this problem because it is real right um
 
01:44:28.830 --> 01:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
and so the uh the guilty we tax guilty
 
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
at 50% we also new hire also taxes All
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
Foreign uh
 
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
dividends when repatriated to the United
 
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
States so there are a host of different
 
01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
methods and ways of trying to address
 
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
the problem and mitigate the problem I
 
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody has devised a
 
01:44:49.599 --> 01:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody has devised a
solution

01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
they haven't devised a solution on the
 
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
international level or the national
 
01:44:57.589 --> 01:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
level and I think it's a bit delusional
 
01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
to think we're going to suddenly do
 
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:02.679 align:start position:0%
something here that's going to create a
 
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
solution in New Hampshire I without
 
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
getting into the weeds I would also just
 
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
suggest to
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
you even if you think that worldwide
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
combined reporting is the right thing to
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
do hb1 121 doesn't do it if you read
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
hb21 it
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%
80% is Preparatory language in history
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
debatable the actual active language of
 
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
the bill is a list of six Provisions
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
that would be repealed so as to
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate the waterers Edge
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
limitation and then there are two
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
Provisions in law where a sentence or a
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
portion of a sentence is
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
added in our
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
hearings and in our commission
 
01:46:01.229 --> 01:46:01.239 align:start position:0%
discussion the dr's representatives made
 
01:46:04.229 --> 01:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
it very clear that this bill would be
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
inadequate to do what it even purports
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
to do it's completely lacking in a
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism it's completely lacking in
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
definitions it gives the Dr No guidance
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in
 
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
fact if you go
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
to page three of the
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
bill it essentially rests on a single
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
sentence that's been added at lines 24
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
and 25 this provision shall authorize
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
the application of worldwide combined
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
reporting that is not
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
legislating and that doesn't actually
 
01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
give the Dr anything that they can go
 
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
work with so you know maybe another bill
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
in another legislature for some somebody
 
01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
who still thinks this is the path to
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
take thank you now I just I'll recognize
 
01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative leapley in a second here
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
but let me first say that any more
 
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
comments let's try to keep them to new
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
new thoughts because we are um the time
 
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
being uh almost 11:20 and we have a lot
 
01:47:14.109 --> 01:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
of work to do let's try to keep it to
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
please thank you um so I have a couple
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
um thoughts first of all this being the
 
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
committee on ways and means I think it
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
is our job to be extremely
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
curious about
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
Taxation and to learn as much as we can
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
about who we tax in the state how we tax
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
in the state how taxes are avoided by
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the state um and and
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
avoidance just to be clear is
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
legal um so I'm not casting
 
01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:00.910 align:start position:0%
legal um so I'm not casting
aspersions

01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
aspersions
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
um so one I think it's our job to ask
 
01:48:06.270 --> 01:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
these questions and to be curious and to
 
01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
try to understand these issues better
 
01:48:15.790 --> 01:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
um it's very hard as an everyday person
 
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:17.589 align:start position:0%
um it's very hard as an everyday person
to

01:48:17.589 --> 01:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:20.440 align:start position:0%
understand what is happening here a lot
 
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
of the discussion of the commission um
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
when it got into details would for
 
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
example be about guilty what is guilty
 
01:48:33.149 --> 01:48:33.159 align:start position:0%
we tax guilty and so therefore we're tax
 
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're we're capturing this Federal money
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
and an everyday person is like what's
 
01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
guilty oh we're taxing it okay so we're
 
01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:41.149 align:start position:0%
guilty oh we're taxing it okay so we're
all

01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
set it's so what I'm getting at here is
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
that it's very easy for this to go into
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
such technical langu language that the
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
actual questions being asked aren't
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
answered um guilty is taxed at a 10%
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
rate between 10 and 133% in the state of
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think that an everyday
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
coffee shop you know maybe Revel Stoke
 
01:49:11.629 --> 01:49:11.639 align:start position:0%
downtown would love to pay 10% so if
 
01:49:13.709 --> 01:49:13.719 align:start position:0%
we're saying something kind of tossing
 
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
it off that oh we tax guilty so we all
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
set like let's acknowledge that that is
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
not the corporate tax rate that is
 
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.229 align:start position:0%
not the corporate tax rate that is
normally

01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
normally
 
01:49:27.550 --> 01:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
taxed the other thing I want to bring up
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
is yes um the oecd is tackling this yes
 
01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:37.639 align:start position:0%
pillar one and two are perhaps Solutions
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
um again I'm just an average person but
 
01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding right now is that while
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
the US um has signed on to Beeps we are
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
not participating in pillar one and
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
pillar too and if as a New Hampshire
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I think it's important that we
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
have this discussion because if our
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
federal government is not going to sign
 
01:50:04.669 --> 01:50:04.679 align:start position:0%
on to pillar one and two and we don't
 
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
even understand what that means one of
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
the things it could mean is that the
 
01:50:14.109 --> 01:50:14.119 align:start position:0%
other 140 countries are starting to get
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
their taxes back from these
 
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
multinationals right so you know big
 
01:50:23.709 --> 01:50:23.719 align:start position:0%
company a France is going to get their
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
20% you know Micronesia is going to get
 
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
their 20% but if we don't start paying
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
attention to what is going on
 
01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
internationally we're not going to get
 
01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:36.679 align:start position:0%
our share so I think it is in the
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
interest of New Hampshire to talk about
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
these very complicated unsexy
 
01:50:45.149 --> 01:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
issues um maybe even talk about them on
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
the floor of the legislature so that
 
01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:49.639 align:start position:0%
they can be more widely understood and
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that we send a message to the federal
 
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
government that the choices that they
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
make affect New Hampshire because as it
 
01:51:03.149 --> 01:51:03.159 align:start position:0%
stands now we are dependent on what is
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
happening at the federal level so if
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're not opting in to International
 
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
tax treaties that
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
capture actual the real revenues made
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear when we're talking
 
01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
about you
 
01:51:23.229 --> 01:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
know this being very difficult for
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
companies to file taxes that
 
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
show the actual revenues
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
made on the international level we're
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
talking about companies that have
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
revenues higher than
 
01:51:41.229 --> 01:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
750 billion no sorry million dollars a
 
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
year so if we're going to talk about oh
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
taxes are really complicated and hard
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
these tax avoidance procedures are
 
01:51:51.069 --> 01:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
really complicated and hard and that's
 
01:51:54.109 --> 01:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
why our local New Hampshire businesses
 
01:51:57.390 --> 01:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
while you're right technically legally
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
can use these same tax avoidance
 
01:52:03.629 --> 01:52:03.639 align:start position:0%
structures they're really expensive and
 
01:52:05.709 --> 01:52:05.719 align:start position:0%
if you make a billion dollars a year it
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
might be interesting to you to execute
 
01:52:11.709 --> 01:52:11.719 align:start position:0%
that but if you're just a mom and pop
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's not and I'm thinking about my own
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
kids they would like to grow up and
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
build their own businesses right
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
so they might want to do they might want
 
01:52:25.310 --> 01:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
to have a rubel Stoke more than they
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
want to go work for $17 an hour at
 
01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
Starbucks so when we're talking about
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
these issues we're talking about the
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
future of our kids and their ability to
 
01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
compete as business owners really
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
matters so I hope that the Curiosity
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
that this bill and that this commission
 
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
has raised won't end with this
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
commission or today's discussion
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
but will increase because this is really
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
impacting Us in New Hampshire and our
 
01:52:58.990 --> 01:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
kids in New Hampshire I know it seems
 
01:53:01.550 --> 01:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
very far away and very International and
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
very high level but this kind of stuff
 
01:53:08.069 --> 01:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
is impacting our retailers ability to
 
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
stay in business every day so I hope
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
that it will
 
01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
stay in our Consciousness thank you
 
01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:17.629 align:start position:0%
stay in our Consciousness thank you
thank

01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to close the work session
 
01:53:26.079 --> 01:53:31.950 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to close the work session
on

01:53:31.950 --> 01:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
hp11 and we'll now open the work session
 
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
192 representative Alid you might have a
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
point to make yeah this one is easy I
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
think on this bill was written with the
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
assumption that the indd tax exists the
 
01:53:59.709 --> 01:53:59.719 align:start position:0%
IND tax will cease to exist on the
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
31st uh of December of this year on this
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
bill would come to
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
the oh uh
 
01:54:11.199 --> 01:54:15.109 align:start position:0%
the oh uh
11

01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
1124 no the the
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:20.669 align:start position:0%
1124 no the the
on

01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:20.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
it it is
 
01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
repealed as of the end of this
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
year I believe HB I believe hb2 has it
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
repealed by the end of next year uh by
 
01:54:36.229 --> 01:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
24 yeah 2% there was a difference
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
between the bill so the bill that that I
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
sponsored um had it ending at the end of
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
this year but H when it got into hb2 it
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
actually ends at the end of 24 could we
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
ask on Mr Wong
 
01:54:55.079 --> 01:54:58.149 align:start position:0%
ask on Mr Wong
to

01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:00.270 --> 01:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
because well does that distinction
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
affect your comment your
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
point well Mr Wong is at the podium so
 
01:55:11.310 --> 01:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
we'll um please introduce yourself and
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh good morning ke Mong from the
 
01:55:15.270 --> 01:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue I believe uh if
 
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
memory serves me that the repeal is uh
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
effective for tax bill periods ending uh
 
01:55:24.069 --> 01:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
beginning after December
 
01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
3125 yeah for tax periods ending a
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
beginning yeah but when I tried to
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
reference in a new bill to reference RSA
 
01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:47.629 align:start position:0%
 
exist

01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
1124 well I
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know that that's that was the
 
01:55:54.189 --> 01:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced but in
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh it ends 1231 tax periods ending
 
01:55:59.199 --> 01:56:02.229 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh it ends 1231 tax periods ending
12

01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
3124 yeah so but that doesn't affect
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
your point does it uh it doesn't affect
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
my point in the sense that having been
 
01:56:21.149 --> 01:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
told that I could not on act on a a a
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
law which is
 
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
repealed on that on I decided to get
 
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
more ambitious about this and uh I have
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
uh written with help from Dr I have
 
01:56:40.510 --> 01:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
written a total rewrite of the century
 
01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:41.510 align:start position:0%
written a total rewrite of the century
old

01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:56:47.229 --> 01:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
law and um set it up in a new
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
chapter that will be her in
 
01:56:55.470 --> 01:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
January which does do the same things of
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh increasing the exemptions tripling
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
the exemptions because they haven't been
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
changed since before my time here which
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
more than 30 years I'm not sure how far
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
back it goes um and
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
um and that bill will be coming
 
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
forward and this bill and
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
as I was told on could not happen
 
01:57:29.069 --> 01:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
because it is based on something that is
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
being repealed so um that is already
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
repealed for a future date and you're
 
01:57:39.109 --> 01:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
making it a lot more complicated than I
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
thought it was but um so I would be
 
01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
willing when we get to the voting
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
session to move itl on this one partly
 
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
also because the
 
01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:56.679 align:start position:0%
the existing law which dies either the
 
01:58:00.189 --> 01:58:00.199 align:start position:0%
end of this year the end of next year um
 
01:58:00.199 --> 01:58:02.189 align:start position:0%
end of this year the end of next year um
is

01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:06.189 --> 01:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
um was written in the beginning of the
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
20th century and has been accreted onto
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
in ways that make it very very difficult
 
01:58:16.030 --> 01:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
for anybody who's not a tax expert at
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
indd law to know what they're doing
 
01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:22.709 align:start position:0%
indd law to know what they're doing
so

01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
um so that is um what I'm planning on
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none I will end the work
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:43.189 --> 01:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
192 we'll now open the work session on
 
01:58:43.199 --> 01:58:45.870 align:start position:0%
192 we'll now open the work session on
HB

01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:49.400 align:start position:0%

01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:12.270 align:start position:0%
that
govern

01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:16.669 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
um way in which the revenues that are
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
raised by the
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
tax uh flow through government channels
 
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
back to and then are applied um the
 
01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
current law um has the collection of the
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
revenues uh by the
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
localities towns and
 
01:59:42.149 --> 01:59:42.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities um throughout the state
 
01:59:46.990 --> 01:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
unincorporated townships um and
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
um and then that money is kept retained
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
locally and uh distributed to school
 
01:59:59.709 --> 01:59:59.719 align:start position:0%
districts that serve the respective
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
towns and
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities um in the first instance
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
to cover um costs that are part of the
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
costing uh formula and um and then if
 
02:00:20.069 --> 02:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
there's additional money that is is uh
 
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
greater is is left over after that
 
02:00:26.589 --> 02:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
allocation for adequacy costs that too
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
is retained locally and if there are
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
additional Education costs that that
 
02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
locality is responsible for in its
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
relationship to school
 
02:00:42.589 --> 02:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
districts uh it will be applied to those
 
02:00:46.510 --> 02:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
School costs uh if uh as is the case in
 
02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:47.589 align:start position:0%
School costs uh if uh as is the case in
some

02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:00:50.709 --> 02:00:50.719 align:start position:0%
instances um there are no other school
 
02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
costs we've got some townships that
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
collect the money but have no CH school
 
02:00:59.390 --> 02:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
children um then the money will be
 
02:01:03.149 --> 02:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
applied um through bookkeeping
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
Arrangements uh to um in effect to
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
offset other costs um in other accounts
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh so that uh those those places show a
 
02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
negative uh School tax rate to make the
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
make it all come out right um so uh this
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
bill 569 would uh change um the
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
distribution of the revenues after
 
02:01:30.270 --> 02:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
they're collected and would send all the
 
02:01:33.629 --> 02:01:33.639 align:start position:0%
revenues back to the uh Department of
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration and that's into
 
02:01:40.109 --> 02:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
the treasury after first a deduction at
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
the local level for the collection costs
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
that would be allowed it's not allowed
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
right now and then uh at the state level
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
um uh it would it would flow uh into the
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh education fund trust
 
02:02:00.750 --> 02:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
fund um in addition the bill Pro
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
provides for um a a more extensive uh
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
more generous um rebate system for
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um that would um would
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the amount of
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
relief available to uh
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
lowincome homeowners who are
 
02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um so that's roughly the bill
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
um the uh uh context in this for this
 
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
bill has been all along
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
litigation uh challenging the retention
 
02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:36.350 align:start position:0%
litigation uh challenging the retention
of

02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
excess uh revenues at the local level
 
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh uh trying to and seeking to
 
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
persuade the Jud uh the uh courts that
 
02:02:53.390 --> 02:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh that uh this is
 
02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and uh must end and a
 
02:02:59.910 --> 02:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
case to that effect is pending as we
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
said as we all know I've spoken about
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
this before it's under
 
02:03:09.629 --> 02:03:09.639 align:start position:0%
advisement uh before judge ruof um and
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh all arguments have been made all
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
briefs have been submitted and he uh is
 
02:03:18.030 --> 02:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
um will release the decision at some
 
02:03:20.430 --> 02:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
point I hoped we'd all hoped I think
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
that it would come out earlier than this
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
and it's critical context for decision-
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
making related to this bill because it's
 
02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
not out um and we don't know which way
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
it will go um and we may may need to
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
respond to the new reality that that
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
decision um uh creates for us always
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
mindful of the fact that appeals can
 
02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
follow to the uh uh state supreme court
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
so it may not be fully resolved um and
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
also mindful of the fact that there's
 
02:03:58.069 --> 02:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
another lawsuit that also in the hands
 
02:04:01.149 --> 02:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
of Judge ruof that challenges the entire
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy formula and seeks to raise
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
significantly the state's
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
obligations um all of that context is to
 
02:04:13.390 --> 02:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
be developed uh and it's going to change
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh probably um so uh with my
 
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation at this stage in the game
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
Rel L is uh to um to ask that we support
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh interim study um as a as a a way of
 
02:04:34.750 --> 02:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
of enabling us to keep our eye on this
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
ball and to at least have
 
02:04:42.669 --> 02:04:42.679 align:start position:0%
discussions um as new information comes
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
out uh that may in the end um have to
 
02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
take the form of a recommendation for
 
02:04:54.189 --> 02:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
legislation um in 2 uh for legislation
 
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
in 2025 which isn't a bad idea because
 
02:04:59.510 --> 02:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's a budget year and a good time to
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
adjust things like this um and um and
 
02:05:08.669 --> 02:05:08.679 align:start position:0%
having this as a uh a way to touch touch
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
down and and think about the issue is uh
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
I think a good idea so I hope that we
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
can go to interim study on this bill for
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
all the reasons that I just stated
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%

the work session on HB
 
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
569 at this time um I think we can take
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
a f minute break but I want to stick to
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
the five minutes let's get back here as
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:06:17.589 align:start position:0%

together

02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:33.950 align:start position:0%

date the effective dates but it is
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
related to an ought to pass
 
02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
sorry uh so representative spillsbury do
 
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
you want to uh we don't uh we got a
 
02:26:11.950 --> 02:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
second yes did you want to speak to your
 
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
motion I think we've had extensive
 
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
discussion during the work session so
 
02:26:18.030 --> 02:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
I'll hold back in the event there's
 
02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
anything I need to reut um I reserve
 
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
that time
 
02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
please thank you would anyone like to
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
speak further on the itl motion
 
02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative Shamburg uh Mr chairman
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh I contest the itl motion the
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
approach I'd like to express some bullet
 
02:26:48.190 --> 02:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
points and then go from there
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that we all can agree that
 
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
taxes are our only sustainable source of
 
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
revenue for independent states like New
 
02:26:58.670 --> 02:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the other 49 states and
 
02:27:01.030 --> 02:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
that our tax policies are to have a fair
 
02:27:03.150 --> 02:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
and Level Playing Field for all who pay
 
02:27:05.389 --> 02:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
taxes and pro business attitudes are
 
02:27:08.429 --> 02:27:08.439 align:start position:0%
okay if it benefits all
 
02:27:12.269 --> 02:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
businesses so why do I contest uh this
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
02:27:18.150 --> 02:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
itl uh the Pres Waters Edge has a blind
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
spot about corporate tax avoidance
 
02:27:23.469 --> 02:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
techniques that makes the taxpaying
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
field for domestic businesses of New
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh unlevel and at a
 
02:27:28.319 --> 02:27:29.469 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh unlevel and at a
competitive

02:27:29.469 --> 02:27:29.479 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
disadvantage due to their relative tax
 
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
burden let's go through a few bullet
 
02:27:40.269 --> 02:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
points uh New Hampshire
 
02:27:43.950 --> 02:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
adopted worldwide combined reporting in
 
02:27:47.309 --> 02:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
1981 and utilized it because because it
 
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
showed increased transparency and it was
 
02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:51.349 align:start position:0%
showed increased transparency and it was
more

02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
Equitable uh the Dr policy of the 1983
 
02:28:00.110 --> 02:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
through 1986 was driven by political
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
pressures uh not to
 
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
enforce on foreign
 
02:28:09.230 --> 02:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
Enterprises the majority commission
 
02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:10.630 align:start position:0%
Enterprises the majority commission
report

02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:28:16.190 --> 02:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
concludes uh that the 1981 through 1986
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh world why combined reporting was
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and it was basically
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
based on the political commentary of the
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
time by the governor that was in the
 
02:28:30.150 --> 02:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
office and
 
02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:31.830 align:start position:0%
office and
then

02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
the ways and means commission then and
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature adopted Waters Edge only
 
02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:39.469 align:start position:0%
the legislature adopted Waters Edge only
to

02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
discrimination New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
Court acknowledged
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
this discrimination in the 1999
 
02:28:53.349 --> 02:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
caterpillar decision we point out that
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
Waters Edge method was adopted for the
 
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of foreign businesses and how do
 
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
I arrive at this
 
02:29:03.750 --> 02:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
because we have a legal opinion by the
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
highest court here in the
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
state prior to 1986 New Hampshire
 
02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:11.150 align:start position:0%

utilized

02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%

02:29:13.550 --> 02:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
worldwide Supreme Court says prior to
 
02:29:16.750 --> 02:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
1986 New Hampshire utilized worldwide
 
02:29:19.230 --> 02:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
combined reporting in which the net

02:29:29.269 --> 02:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
in the tax base in 1986 the legislature
 
02:29:31.269 --> 02:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court says adopted The Waters
 
02:29:34.349 --> 02:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
Edge method eliminating overseas
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%

tax and the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:29:44.269 --> 02:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
said the nature of the Waters Edge
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
formula requires that foreign subsidiary
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%

latter's income is subject to taxation
 
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
that means the domestics while the
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%

impact on New Hampshire based

businesses waterers Edge violates the
 
02:31:08.469 --> 02:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution because it
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
puts New Hampshire businesses at a
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
competitive disadvantage and is in is
 
02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
anti-democratic which is what the New
 
02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has said in
 
02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
their words
 
02:31:26.990 --> 02:31:27.000 align:start position:0%

02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
eliminates overseas businesses from

impact on foreign uh companies as they
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh uh going back a moment the DR had
 
02:31:46.890 --> 02:31:46.900 align:start position:0%
spoken and had
 
02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:48.710 align:start position:0%
spoken and had
[Music]

02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh the CPA uh organization has spoken
 
02:31:56.710 --> 02:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
about the the effect
 
02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
of translations money issues
 
02:32:04.349 --> 02:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
and there is little impact on foreign
 
02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
companies now as they must already
 
02:32:10.349 --> 02:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
prepare all the information required in
 
02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
the worldwide combined reporting for the
 
02:32:15.269 --> 02:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
federal government and the

02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
the Dr there's little impact on the Dr
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire law already requires
 
02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
companies to translate into English and
 
02:32:28.670 --> 02:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
convert to US
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
Dollars waterers Edge gives foreign
 
02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
companies an advantage making New
 
02:32:35.870 --> 02:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses pay more or denying
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
the state of Revenue or both our
 
02:32:41.389 --> 02:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
domestic companies pay 100% of their
 
02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
total tax
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
liability versus the reported tax
 
02:32:50.110 --> 02:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
liability from the foreign
 
02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
multinationals while majority and and
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
the Dr say they can't measure Revenue
 
02:32:59.630 --> 02:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
impact it's simple common sense that
 
02:33:03.269 --> 02:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
broadening tax base will result in more
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
revenue and it is time to level the
 
02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:07.590 align:start position:0%
revenue and it is time to level the
playing

02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
playing
 
02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
field we have two tiers of
 
02:33:14.030 --> 02:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
Taxation in the paying of BPT one for
 
02:33:16.429 --> 02:33:16.439 align:start position:0%
domestic and one for foreign
 
02:33:18.670 --> 02:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
multinationals as pointed out by the New
 
02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court and I'd like to
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
do a
 
02:33:26.230 --> 02:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
little analogy
 
02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
here should Canadians or British or any
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
foreign visitors to New Hampshire be
 
02:33:36.670 --> 02:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
exempt from the state's meals and rooms
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
tax or the car rental tax how about the
 
02:33:42.469 --> 02:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
state's tobacco
 
02:33:45.910 --> 02:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
tax should foreigners be exempt what
 
02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire property taxes
 
02:33:50.110 --> 02:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
should New Hampshire Property Owners
 
02:33:52.349 --> 02:33:52.359 align:start position:0%

02:34:03.030 --> 02:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
in those New Hampshire taxes to make up
 
02:34:05.870 --> 02:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
the shortfall the taxes that foreigners
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
can legally avoid if the laws allowed it
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%

court I
 
02:35:01.070 --> 02:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
find as I conclude
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
here that we presently have two tiers of
 
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
Taxation in the paying of BPT one for
 
02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:12.560 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:35:20.510 --> 02:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
democracy is opposed to this there is no
 
02:35:23.150 --> 02:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
privileged class in the United States or
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire whether it be for people
 
02:35:28.389 --> 02:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
or for business
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
Arrangements thank you
 
02:35:35.230 --> 02:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
you any other comments
 
02:35:41.870 --> 02:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
spills I think representative already
 
02:35:47.309 --> 02:35:47.319 align:start position:0%
had his hand up first yeah just just
 
02:35:50.510 --> 02:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
briefly uh thank representative shamberg
 
02:35:52.750 --> 02:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
for his advocacy however I think a
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
couple of uh factual mistakes were made
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
based upon information that was given
 
02:36:00.510 --> 02:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
during the commission report uh all
 
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
businesses regardless of their status
 
02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
are treated the same way under rbpt bet
 
02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
according to Dr testimony in
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
addition one can um agree that the
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
caterpillar decision does say
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh that uh the tax code changing to
 
02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
waterers Edge gives benefit to large
 
02:36:24.670 --> 02:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
multinationals that's a a function of
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
scale that's nothing more than that and
 
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
we do have cutouts and um divisions and
 
02:36:36.110 --> 02:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and subdivisions of
 
02:36:39.150 --> 02:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of our tax code which uh
 
02:36:42.269 --> 02:36:42.279 align:start position:0%
have existed for a long time indeed um
 
02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
Professor Hearn that uh representative
 
02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
Aly brought uh several years ago to this
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee to talk um said that such
 
02:36:54.710 --> 02:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
activity was perfectly legal so long as
 
02:36:57.630 --> 02:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
it stayed was perfectly legal rather so
 
02:37:00.030 --> 02:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
long as it stayed within the same class
 
02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:01.550 align:start position:0%
long as it stayed within the same class
of

02:37:01.550 --> 02:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayer so that you can have a
 
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
different tax rate for this person or
 
02:37:10.269 --> 02:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
this group of people as to this group of
 
02:37:12.309 --> 02:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
people who though although they may be
 
02:37:16.349 --> 02:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
similar are different by definition
 
02:37:20.429 --> 02:37:20.439 align:start position:0%
so I I think some of the uh arguments
 
02:37:25.230 --> 02:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
that were made were
 
02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:26.870 align:start position:0%
that were made were
passionate

02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
passionate
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
however don't really apply to
 
02:37:36.870 --> 02:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
what worldwide reporting um will do in
 
02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
my opinion thank you Mr chair
 
02:37:42.670 --> 02:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again I don't want
 
02:37:47.469 --> 02:37:47.479 align:start position:0%
want to repeat the many things that were
 
02:37:48.990 --> 02:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
said earlier in the work session but
 
02:37:52.030 --> 02:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
there are several assertions that uh
 
02:37:58.469 --> 02:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
reut I would encourage everybody to read
 
02:38:05.870 --> 02:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
the um the commission report in full
 
02:38:07.469 --> 02:38:07.479 align:start position:0%
even if you haven't had a chance to do
 
02:38:09.389 --> 02:38:09.399 align:start position:0%
it yet certainly you'll want to do it by
 
02:38:12.030 --> 02:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
the time this bill comes to the floor in
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
January you'll find that everything
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed
 
02:38:19.269 --> 02:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
was in fact considered and addressed
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
you'll find that it's been addressed in
 
02:38:22.590 --> 02:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
a very balanced
 
02:38:26.910 --> 02:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
way and I would just say uh as an aside
 
02:38:28.429 --> 02:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
that I've received several compliments
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
for the quality of the commission's
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
report in the last
 
02:38:38.190 --> 02:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
week so I stand by the report the report
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
clarifies this mky situation from 1981
 
02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:44.710 align:start position:0%
clarifies this mky situation from 1981
to

02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
86 and if you look at the legislative
 
02:38:49.469 --> 02:38:49.479 align:start position:0%
history in which then Governor John
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
sonunu testified personally in front of
 
02:38:53.309 --> 02:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
the Ways and Means Committee on two
 
02:38:55.469 --> 02:38:55.479 align:start position:0%
occasions that's how strongly he felt
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
about the
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
bill the dr's explicit policy to not
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
solicit or
 
02:39:08.550 --> 02:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
accept a unitary worldwide filing from
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
any foreign uh
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
multinational did in fact it created a
 
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
de facto discriminatory situation and
 
02:39:18.510 --> 02:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
when you read the legislative history
 
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:27.230 align:start position:0%
 
repealed

02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
second when it's asserted that water's
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
edge codifies a real
 
02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
discrimination and we refer to the 1999
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
caterpillar case I'd like to just read a
 
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
passage from the commission's report
 
02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
that includes a quotation from that
 
02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
case so
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court's
 
02:39:51.070 --> 02:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
decision in the 1999 caterpillar case
 
02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
found that the New Hampshire dr's
 
02:39:56.710 --> 02:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
differential treatment differential
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
treatment of foreign Affiliates from us
 
02:40:01.349 --> 02:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
taxable entities under the waters edge
 
02:40:05.389 --> 02:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
method was not unconstitutional
 
02:40:07.389 --> 02:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
discrimination under the federal
 
02:40:11.469 --> 02:40:11.479 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause stating quote in sum we
 
02:40:13.389 --> 02:40:13.399 align:start position:0%
reject the plaintiff's argument that New
 
02:40:15.630 --> 02:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's apportionment formula UNC
 
02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
constitutionally discriminates between
 
02:40:19.150 --> 02:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
foreign and domestic subsidiaries in a
 
02:40:21.710 --> 02:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
unitary business the nature of the wat's
 
02:40:24.269 --> 02:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
edge formula requires that foreign
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries be treated differently from
 
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
domestic subsidiaries but most
 
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
significantly the latter's income is
 
02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
not so it goes on to say the plaintiffs
 
02:40:40.750 --> 02:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
fail however to meet their burden in
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
proving discrimination although New
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's unitary apportionment
 
02:40:46.590 --> 02:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
formula may not a portion income
 
02:40:49.550 --> 02:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
perfectly the Federal Constitution does
 
02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
not require mathematical exactitude only
 
02:40:54.030 --> 02:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
a rough
 
02:40:56.309 --> 02:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
approximation and the caterpillar Court
 
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court then
 
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
quotes the United States Supreme Court's
 
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
decision in in
 
02:41:05.950 --> 02:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
container um Corporation of America and
 
02:41:08.790 --> 02:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
U and in Barkley's bank and
 
02:41:11.790 --> 02:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
others so differential
 
02:41:17.150 --> 02:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
treatment is inherent in taxation
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
some taxpayers are personal individuals
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
some are C Corps some are subses some
 
02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:24.030 align:start position:0%
some are C Corps some are subses some
are

02:41:24.030 --> 02:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
LLCs some invest in hard assets some
 
02:41:30.670 --> 02:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
don't differential treatment is
 
02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the federal and the state tax
 
02:41:37.870 --> 02:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
code what that case actually stands for
 
02:41:40.269 --> 02:41:40.279 align:start position:0%
the caterpillar case stands for the fact
 
02:41:43.670 --> 02:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
that the waters edge method is not
 
02:41:47.389 --> 02:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
discriminatory in a constitution
 
02:41:50.670 --> 02:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
sense the assertion was made common
 
02:41:53.950 --> 02:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
sense that broadening the base will will
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
result in increasing tax revenue the
 
02:42:00.750 --> 02:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
commission dug into this and found that
 
02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:42:06.429 --> 02:42:06.439 align:start position:0%
false it is not it is a flawed
 
02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
assumption to presume that when you
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
expand the tax base you're going to get
 
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
more tax
 
02:42:15.550 --> 02:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
revenue so let let me try to explain
 
02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:16.550 align:start position:0%
revenue so let let me try to explain
this

02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
briefly in separate filing each
 
02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
corporate entity files their own tax
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
return in Combined reporting which we
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
have adopted to the water's
 
02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
edge all activities across the 50 states
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
are combined into a single return this
 
02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
is why New Hampshire uses this very
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
curious formulary
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
apportionment so when we talk about the
 
02:42:43.870 --> 02:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
change the legislature made a couple of
 
02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
years ago from three Factor
 
02:42:49.950 --> 02:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
to single sales Factor we're talking
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
about an Arcane
 
02:42:57.030 --> 02:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
methodology for expanding the base out
 
02:43:00.389 --> 02:43:00.399 align:start position:0%
to the water's edge out to the 50 states
 
02:43:03.110 --> 02:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
and then allocating it
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
back based on sales factor to New
 
02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if you eliminate the
 
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
waterers Edge limitation and apply
 
02:43:16.190 --> 02:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
combined reporting worldwide
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
yes you dramatically expand the base all
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
of a sudden it becomes relevant what
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
sell oil made in Britain what they
 
02:43:25.790 --> 02:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
earned in Netherlands what they earned
 
02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
in Indonesia etc etc
 
02:43:30.469 --> 02:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
etc but just
 
02:43:35.630 --> 02:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
imagine as that denominator mushrooms
 
02:43:39.070 --> 02:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
out New Hampshire becomes infantes
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
smaller so just consider this
 
02:43:48.070 --> 02:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
0.34% of the economy of the United
 
02:43:53.790 --> 02:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
States right there's 50 states and we're
 
02:43:57.790 --> 02:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
a small one so it's a third of a
 
02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
percent and so even when we apply
 
02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:01.550 align:start position:0%
percent and so even when we apply
Water's

02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
Water's
 
02:44:03.870 --> 02:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
Edge if you've got a company that's
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
doing business in 50 states you might
 
02:44:08.590 --> 02:44:08.600 align:start position:0%
just say more or less roughly they're
 
02:44:11.070 --> 02:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
going to allocate only 34% of that
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
business activity in New Hampshire that
 
02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
of course is going to vary very much on
 
02:44:17.070 --> 02:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
where they're based and how they're
 
02:44:20.190 --> 02:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
doing business but it does not
 
02:44:22.469 --> 02:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily generate more income because
 
02:44:24.590 --> 02:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
you expand the base and you contract the
 
02:44:26.630 --> 02:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
numerator and you may end up in the same
 
02:44:29.710 --> 02:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
place or even worse than where you
 
02:44:33.309 --> 02:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
were I hate to labor through that but
 
02:44:35.309 --> 02:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
the reason you need the reason you
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
needed a commission and the reason you
 
02:44:41.550 --> 02:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.150 --> 02:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
complicated final

02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:44:48.590 --> 02:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
what the federal government does in the
 
02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
so-called separate filing system is they
 
02:44:54.990 --> 02:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
deploy a methodology called arms
 
02:44:59.389 --> 02:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
length and they have a a elaborate set
 
02:44:59.399 --> 02:45:00.230 align:start position:0%
length and they have a a elaborate set
of

02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
regulations that give them the ability
 
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
to insist that a foreign company that is
 
02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
using transfer
 
02:45:12.990 --> 02:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
pricing use reasonable prices and in the
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
audit process if they find that a
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
corporation has been making transfer
 
02:45:19.710 --> 02:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
payments that are
 
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
not as two different entities at arms
 
02:45:27.230 --> 02:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
length would do like two unaffiliated
 
02:45:28.830 --> 02:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
corporations in a contractual
 
02:45:30.190 --> 02:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
relationship would
 
02:45:33.469 --> 02:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
do then they their regulations give them
 
02:45:38.269 --> 02:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
the the authority to um to correct it to
 
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
insist in uh revised tax return to
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
enforce the
 
02:45:44.349 --> 02:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
law New Hampshire gets the benefit out
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
of that activity
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
so the kico case that was cited is an
 
02:45:52.110 --> 02:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
example of that the reason that that was
 
02:45:54.030 --> 02:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
in the court was because it was an
 
02:45:56.830 --> 02:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement action to insist that arms
 
02:45:59.910 --> 02:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
length pricing adjustments be
 
02:46:04.269 --> 02:46:04.279 align:start position:0%
made it's actually an example of getting
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
into the specific tax return of a
 
02:46:10.349 --> 02:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
specific T tax Filer and correcting
 
02:46:10.359 --> 02:46:12.110 align:start position:0%
specific T tax Filer and correcting
it

02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
so the
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
assertion that there are two tiers of
 
02:46:19.790 --> 02:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
Taxation is just not
 
02:46:22.710 --> 02:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
valid there may be different outcomes
 
02:46:24.309 --> 02:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
there may be different
 
02:46:27.429 --> 02:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances some companies may make
 
02:46:29.469 --> 02:46:29.479 align:start position:0%
certain transfers and some may even
 
02:46:33.110 --> 02:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
abuse them but the idea that our system
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
is fundamentally set up so that there's
 
02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
supportable thank you representative
 
02:46:42.429 --> 02:46:42.439 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and and thank you for all the
 
02:46:44.190 --> 02:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
work you you've done in this commission
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
and the Deep dive that you've done there
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
representative PL yes I did not
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
understand one thing you said
 
02:46:53.070 --> 02:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury I'll use an
 
02:46:55.550 --> 02:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
example hypothetical let's say a
 
02:46:57.070 --> 02:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
business is doing a million dollars of
 
02:46:59.150 --> 02:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
sales in New Hampshire and they're doing
 
02:47:02.550 --> 02:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
500 million Nationwide so it would be 1
 
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
million over 500 million time uh uh time
 
02:47:08.190 --> 02:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
times the tax tax burden that would come
 
02:47:11.469 --> 02:47:11.479 align:start position:0%
out Water's Edge if you go to uh
 
02:47:13.389 --> 02:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
worldwide you still have the 1 million
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but you might have three
 
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
billion uh internationally so it's much
 
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
but but that percentage would be
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
therefore much reduced and you don't
 
02:47:23.710 --> 02:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
wind up necessarily with more tax that
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
correct the one thing you said was that
 
02:47:29.309 --> 02:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
is precisely correct because as you
 
02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
expand the tax base you dilute the
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
numerator and you end up with something
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is no greater because you have a
 
02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
smaller share of a larger pool you said
 
02:47:40.630 --> 02:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
reduce the numerator that I did not
 
02:47:43.190 --> 02:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
accept but you you it's it's diluted
 
02:47:45.630 --> 02:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
because you have a bigger base
 
02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
the denominator grows the numerator
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
strengths and so the uh the fraction
 
02:47:54.150 --> 02:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
becomes dramatically smart I didn't
 
02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
understand how the numerator shrinks
 
02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
because it's the same revenues in New
 
02:47:58.469 --> 02:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire either way sales in New
 
02:48:03.309 --> 02:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
way you're yes mathematics and I'm I'm
 
02:48:08.469 --> 02:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
thinking of the equation in two
 
02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
different ways but you're right it's
 
02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the profits earned in New
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire div Ed by under our current
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
system the profits earned across 50
 
02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
states and if this was implemented it's
 
02:48:25.870 --> 02:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
the same numerator in terms of profits
 
02:48:27.790 --> 02:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
against a much larger denominator so
 
02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
that the percentage of the factor is
 
02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:34.349 align:start position:0%
that the percentage of the factor is
dramatically

02:48:34.349 --> 02:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
reduced Mr chairman I'm
 
02:48:41.349 --> 02:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
sorry uh yes representative
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
Aly thank
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
you on
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
the problem because of the transfer
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
pricing is that the profits that you're
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
on are reduced artificially because
 
02:49:04.830 --> 02:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
Microsoft or Amazon which are two of the
 
02:49:08.110 --> 02:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
ones that play with this in this field
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
on have sent their um sent their
 
02:49:16.670 --> 02:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
intellectual property at a reduced rate
 
02:49:21.630 --> 02:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
to their subsidiary in Ireland or the
 
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
Virgin Islands or
 
02:49:27.389 --> 02:49:27.399 align:start position:0%
wherever uh where there is a
 
02:49:27.399 --> 02:49:29.630 align:start position:0%
wherever uh where there is a
05%

02:49:29.630 --> 02:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
05%
 
02:49:33.790 --> 02:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
tax uh and that has reduced their
 
02:49:36.070 --> 02:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
profits everywhere
 
02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
else and
 
02:49:43.469 --> 02:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
um that is an issue which
 
02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
is the are trying to work on especially
 
02:49:51.309 --> 02:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
in Europe and some other countries on
 
02:49:54.349 --> 02:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
not so much in the United States and I
 
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
believe that is partly because the IRS
 
02:50:02.269 --> 02:50:02.279 align:start position:0%
for years has been starved of Revenue of
 
02:50:06.550 --> 02:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
money and has has red had to reduce a
 
02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
lot of what it was doing especially
 
02:50:12.110 --> 02:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
going after very wealthy corporations
 
02:50:15.030 --> 02:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
that it requires a lot of money to go
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
after they are now starting to do that
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
they may start working on this but
 
02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:24.469 align:start position:0%
they may start working on this but
um

02:50:24.469 --> 02:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:29.389 --> 02:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:33.469 --> 02:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
issue and because we have
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
just on against the will of both sides
 
02:50:43.110 --> 02:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
of our committee on moved to a system
 
02:50:46.110 --> 02:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
that starts this next next year I
 
02:50:49.229 --> 02:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
believe of um or maybe it's start it
 
02:50:51.870 --> 02:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
started this year actually we'll see it
 
02:50:55.030 --> 02:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
next year uh single sales Factor based
 
02:50:58.670 --> 02:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
only on sales in a state with an elderly
 
02:51:02.110 --> 02:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
population and a lot of businesses that
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
specialize in selling outside the state
 
02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
instead of inside the state uh we are
 
02:51:10.710 --> 02:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
going to be in considerable amount of
 
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
trouble and I want to
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
keep every idea even if they aren't
 
02:51:21.229 --> 02:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
fully developed yet on that might help
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
us to survive that alive so I'm going to
 
02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
be voting against the itl thank
 
02:51:33.830 --> 02:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
you representa spilburg I think much of
 
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
what representative Amy has just said is
 
02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
valid but it doesn't change my
 
02:51:45.590 --> 02:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
conclusion um and and I you've just just
 
02:51:47.870 --> 02:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
um zeroed in again on the single sales
 
02:51:50.349 --> 02:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
factor and I am actually a little
 
02:51:53.950 --> 02:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
concerned as I think quietly listening
 
02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
to The Exchange I had with
 
02:52:00.389 --> 02:52:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:04.309 --> 02:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
clear where where you have three factors
 
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
what you do is you take that mix right
 
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
of assets and employment and and sales
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
so we're now moving into single sales
 
02:52:12.910 --> 02:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
Factor let's focus on that but you
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
basically are asking them to do is to
 
02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
measure their sales in New
 
02:52:21.590 --> 02:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's the numerator not the
 
02:52:24.550 --> 02:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
profits sales in New Hampshire to the
 
02:52:27.269 --> 02:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
sales across the 50 states and if we go
 
02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
forward with Worldwide combined to the
 
02:52:30.680 --> 02:52:31.990 align:start position:0%
forward with Worldwide combined to the
sales

02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
sales
 
02:52:34.750 --> 02:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
worldwide and that's the ratio that you
 
02:52:36.910 --> 02:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
then multiply against their worldwide
 
02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
profits to determine what portion of
 
02:52:41.309 --> 02:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
those profits are attributable to New
 
02:52:42.750 --> 02:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and subject to New Hampshire
 
02:52:47.309 --> 02:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
tax so the RTI ratio is sales
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
activity multiplied against worldwide
 
02:52:52.910 --> 02:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
profits to determine the New Hampshire
 
02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:58.190 align:start position:0%
profits to determine the New Hampshire
taxable

02:52:58.190 --> 02:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:02.229 --> 02:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
profit represent shamber just to finish
 
02:53:05.790 --> 02:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
this up uh when representative oy was
 
02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:08.990 align:start position:0%
this up uh when representative oy was
talking

02:53:08.990 --> 02:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:12.670 --> 02:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
about all these experts that came
 
02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
in and gave their
 
02:53:19.229 --> 02:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
explanations I appreciate that but that
 
02:53:21.510 --> 02:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
is not what the legal position was by
 
02:53:24.670 --> 02:53:24.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:26.550 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme
Court

02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
Court
 
02:53:32.510 --> 02:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay and in our commission I uh I uh
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
called my good friend from Charleston he
 
02:53:37.309 --> 02:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
should have been a coach coach
 
02:53:42.550 --> 02:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
spillsbury because at times uh I believe
 
02:53:45.670 --> 02:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
that there's some mystery Direction
 
02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:47.750 align:start position:0%
that there's some mystery Direction
here

02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh in contrast to what this New
 
02:53:52.910 --> 02:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court pointed out in
 
02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:55.309 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court pointed out in
the

02:53:55.309 --> 02:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:55.319 --> 02:53:56.910 align:start position:0%
 
summation

02:53:56.910 --> 02:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
summation
 
02:53:59.030 --> 02:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
the foreign
 
02:54:01.469 --> 02:54:01.479 align:start position:0%
multinationals were
 
02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
arguing about dividends and
 
02:54:09.269 --> 02:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
royalties not their entire
 
02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
income and it's only the US
 
02:54:13.279 --> 02:54:15.710 align:start position:0%
income and it's only the US
multinationals

02:54:15.710 --> 02:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
multinationals
 
02:54:18.309 --> 02:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
that are taxed on the dividends and
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
royalties sent over or sent back from
 
02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:23.070 align:start position:0%
royalties sent over or sent back from
their

02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:54:26.070 --> 02:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
subsidiaries anywhere else in the world
 
02:54:29.670 --> 02:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:33.710 --> 02:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
about and when it is
 
02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:35.309 align:start position:0%
about and when it is
said

02:54:35.309 --> 02:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:54:38.510 --> 02:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
that there was no discriminatory Factor
 
02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:40.279 align:start position:0%
this is what they're talking about the
 
02:54:42.790 --> 02:54:42.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is talking
 
02:54:45.950 --> 02:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
about that they were not being treated
 
02:54:48.750 --> 02:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
any differently than any
 
02:54:52.309 --> 02:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
other uh domestic business that receives
 
02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
dividends and
 
02:54:57.469 --> 02:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
royalties because this was value added
 
02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
reported I hope
 
02:55:10.229 --> 02:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
that we will eventually be able to make
 
02:55:12.030 --> 02:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
some positions on
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
the floor of the house come January
 
02:55:17.870 --> 02:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
which I think would we would find very
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
interesting and try and
 
02:55:19.760 --> 02:55:22.070 align:start position:0%
interesting and try and
explain

02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
explain
 
02:55:27.389 --> 02:55:27.399 align:start position:0%
to 480 or 380 other Representatives what
 
02:55:31.309 --> 02:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
this is about and uh hope you'll give us
 
02:55:36.349 --> 02:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:39.670 --> 02:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
you yes representative elberger thank
 
02:55:43.229 --> 02:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um representative
 
02:55:45.469 --> 02:55:45.479 align:start position:0%
spillsbury pointed out that New
 
02:55:49.389 --> 02:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy is about a third of 1%
 
02:55:53.550 --> 02:55:53.560 align:start position:0%
of the United States uh
 
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
economy we have fewer than a million and
 
02:55:58.990 --> 02:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
a half people here out of
 
02:56:02.389 --> 02:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
a uh total population of over 300
 
02:56:04.110 --> 02:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
million if I remember
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
correctly we don't have a problem saying
 
02:56:09.870 --> 02:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
even so we want a distinction such as
 
02:56:12.349 --> 02:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
being the first in the nation in
 
02:56:15.309 --> 02:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
presidential primaries and that's great
 
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
it the fact that we may be a small state
 
02:56:21.750 --> 02:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
with a small economy doesn't mitigate
 
02:56:24.429 --> 02:56:24.439 align:start position:0%
the factor that we have the right and
 
02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility to look at what that
 
02:56:30.349 --> 02:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
means um there are two issues there's
 
02:56:31.630 --> 02:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
02:56:35.150 --> 02:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
revenue and as Ways and Means Committee
 
02:56:38.429 --> 02:56:38.439 align:start position:0%
members we are charged with looking at
 
02:56:42.309 --> 02:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
that revenue and what it uh will do at
 
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of funding our state for the
 
02:56:44.760 --> 02:56:45.750 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of funding our state for the
coming

02:56:45.750 --> 02:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
coming
 
02:56:49.190 --> 02:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
years as Representatives we're also
 
02:56:51.870 --> 02:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
charged with I believe we're charged
 
02:56:56.790 --> 02:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
with dealing with the issue of fairness
 
02:57:01.070 --> 02:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
and whether that means that uh tax
 
02:57:04.030 --> 02:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
revenues might drop or
 
02:57:09.950 --> 02:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
increase if we switched to a nonwater
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
edge way of looking at things the issue
 
02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
is we need to be fair and not put our
 
02:57:21.150 --> 02:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
own State companies at a disadvantage in
 
02:57:23.309 --> 02:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
access to
 
02:57:26.510 --> 02:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
tax uh tax
 
02:57:30.670 --> 02:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
law sometimes the law is wrong uh the
 
02:57:32.510 --> 02:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
country was founded on the belief that
 
02:57:35.309 --> 02:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
the British law was wrong and we needed
 
02:57:38.630 --> 02:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
to set up our own laws oh not more than
 
02:57:40.389 --> 02:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
a hundred years ago just over a 100
 
02:57:42.910 --> 02:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
years ago women by law were not allowed
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
02:57:48.670 --> 02:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
we change laws as we see we need to
 
02:57:53.670 --> 02:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
to ensure fairness and Equity of access
 
02:57:57.309 --> 02:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
not necessarily of outcome but of access
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
and I believe that that's an equal part
 
02:58:02.389 --> 02:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
of what this
 
02:58:04.670 --> 02:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
entails in addition to the issue of what
 
02:58:06.550 --> 02:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
the revenue would be thank
 
02:58:10.790 --> 02:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:15.510 --> 02:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
else all right if if I can one represent
 
02:58:18.190 --> 02:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
I just want to be very
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
brief I am one of those who applauds New
 
02:58:23.950 --> 02:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's willingness to be courageous
 
02:58:27.870 --> 02:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
and different and uh you know we can all
 
02:58:30.750 --> 02:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
come up with many examples and defend
 
02:58:35.309 --> 02:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
them but we're talking about taxation
 
02:58:37.950 --> 02:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about multinational
 
02:58:39.630 --> 02:58:39.640 align:start position:0%
situation we're talking about
 
02:58:42.910 --> 02:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement hurdles talking about filing

complications talking about auditing
 
02:58:47.070 --> 02:58:47.080 align:start position:0%

this in a way that delinks us from the
 
02:58:52.670 --> 02:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code I think that's
 
02:58:55.630 --> 02:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
unwise so we can choose when it's right
 
02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
to be different and we can choose when
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:04.429 --> 02:59:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:09.309 --> 02:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
you all right seeing uh no more we will
 
02:59:11.830 --> 02:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh ask the clerk to take the role I
