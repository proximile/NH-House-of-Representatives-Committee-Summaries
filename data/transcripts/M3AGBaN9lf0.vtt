all all right
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
um we have a number of bills to uh exec
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh today and there are some of those
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
that are on the schedule for exing um I
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
believe we are not we're just not ready
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
to exec because there are either
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
amendments or or other issues that have
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
to be uh discussed
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
um since I know that uh House Bill 1283
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
is a bill that has generated you know
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
probably the probably more attention
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
than than uh any any others I guess I
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
would like to introduce that uh first um
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
as something uh to talk about and I and
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
um guess I would recognize uh
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative Smith if I could on that
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.870 align:start position:0%
representative Smith if I could on that
please

00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair and I look out and
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
although I never wear badges or symbols
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
of I see a lot and I know many people
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
are here for uh for this particular bill
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
but I have a problem um that i' I'd like
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
to raise
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee have
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
identified several amendments that they
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
would like to have
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
considered um on this bill but none of
 
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.390 align:start position:0%
considered um on this bill but none of
the

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%
Amendments um have
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
been able to be presented to us yet so
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
to towards voting on a bill where we
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't have all the details yet um and I
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
know how disappointing that would be for
 
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
people who have traveled here and
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
we we honor their commitment to the
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
issue but think that I would suggest
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
that we put off
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
discussion and eventual voting on this
 
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
bill for um till next week when we when
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
we have already posted that we would
 
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
deal with the bills we couldn't deal
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
with today I believe that's next
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
Wednesday afternoon on the 21st is that
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
correct that that is correct that is
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
correct thank you um so I guess what I
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
would what I would say is this just and
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
I want to hear from what other people
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
have to say about this but my
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
inclination is that um repr
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
representative Smith is correct and that
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
would be my inclination of what to do
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
also and I just just to to
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
put um uh a little more detail on that
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
for among the amendments to people who
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
were here at the hearing may recall that
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
there was some testimony we heard from a
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
um I believe two representatives of
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists as to whether or not they
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
should be included in the bill um and
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
um that seemed to make sense as I as I
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
as I tried to go through it the bill
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
line by line
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I'm not completely convinced
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
whether we need to put them in there or
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
not um in terms of uh of uh what would
 
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
make the most sense but that's one one
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
possibility that that we need I think we
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
need to think about um more carefully
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
and the other uh the other just a couple
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
of other examples there has been
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
some uh talk about whether or not um
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
right now the bill uh uh
 
00:20:00.159 --> 00:20:01.750 align:start position:0%
right now the bill uh uh
contains

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
contains
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
um among the people that can
 
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.470 align:start position:0%
um among the people that can
be

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh Prov uh healthc care provider are
 
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.990 align:start position:0%
uh uh Prov uh healthc care provider are
included

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
um uh an advanced practice registered
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
nurse license pursuant to RSA
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
326b and a physician's assistant uh
 
00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
license pursuant to
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
328 uh D um and there's been some uh
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
um whether it's appropriate to include
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
those uh those individuals or should it
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
just be limited to um should uh uh
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
physicians assistant be removed or
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
should physician's assistant and
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
advanced practice registered nurse be
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
removed so that it would be limited only
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
to a physician or an osteopath the other
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh thing that I discovered is that there
 
00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.789 align:start position:0%
uh thing that I discovered is that there
is

00:20:59.789 --> 00:20:59.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
some I think there may need to be
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
some cleanup for lack of a better term
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
of language in the bill for example one
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
of the terms that's defined in the bill
 
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.789 align:start position:0%
of the terms that's defined in the bill
is

00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:15.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
um uh healthc care
 
00:21:23.789 --> 00:21:23.799 align:start position:0%
provider um and and
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry one of the one of the terms
 
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
that's defined is in the bill is
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
prescribing healthc care
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
provider but later in the bill
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
that the term attending physician is
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
used or attending provider is used and I
 
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.430 align:start position:0%
used or attending provider is used and I
think

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that there my
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
impression is that that was not intended
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
to be a substantive change
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
but as somebody who has worked with
 
00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
language in my past life um I understand
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
that sometimes there using different
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
words when you mean the same thing can
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
be a problem so uh that might be
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be looked at
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
also so for those um for those reasons
 
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.990 align:start position:0%
also so for those um for those reasons
my

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
inclination um would be that we are not
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
ready to vote on uh 1283 today um that's
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
my inclination other people have any uh
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
any other view representative Alexander
 
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I believe there
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
are a number of members that may want an
 
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
amendment or something to clean up what
 
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
you said was deeply flawed language but
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
I think there are a number of members
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
that are ready to vote on a deeply
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
flawed bill today so I'm happy to wait
 
00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:41.559 align:start position:0%
if the committee decides that but I'm
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
ready to vote today thank you all right
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez I know you
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple of the thing cleanup
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
things but I have gone through the bill
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
as a healthare provider not a lawyer as
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
a health care
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
provider line by line there's a lot more
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
residents requirement lots more what the
 
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
bill does for normalizing normalizing
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
suicide for teens there's a lot of words
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
what is reasonable me medical judgment
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cleanup that needs to
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
be done whether you are for this or
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
you're against it the amendment itself
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
in my opinion as a medical
 
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
person for 42 years plus the bill itself
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
is flawed I I don't think there is
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
anything you can do in a week to clean
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
up this bill and make it appropriate for
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at and I'm ready to
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
vote on it as well so let me I just I
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
guess what I just wanted to ask
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
representative pres make sure I'm
 
00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
understanding is I mean is there
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
anything are there you said you've
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
you've you've gone through the bill
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
you've seen a number of things that need
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
to be cleaned up are are are are those
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
things that you would propose amendments
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
or or is your position that no matter
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
what the Amendments would be you're
 
00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
still opposed to the
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
bill I don't want to put in amendments
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
on these things I have no idea how to
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
clean this up I have no idea how to take
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
line 20 reasonable medical judgment and
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
make that cleaned up I have no idea to
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know coercion how to clean that up
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh provider must have health records all
 
00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:31.240 align:start position:0%
the records since the person was
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosed there's a lot I I don't know
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
how to clean up this bill okay I think
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
the bill needs to um I I'm I'm concerned
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
about what we want to do with this bill
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
I know a few years
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
ago people knew it was open up to other
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
things I don't know if this is similar
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
to that bill but I mean does the bill
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
need to be r re retained I I don't know
 
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
if you can clean it up and how I feel
 
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
about it I have two sides I have the
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
first generation Italian Catholic and I
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
have the legislature I have not heard
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
from one of my
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
constituents that they want this bill so
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's the legislator side of yes
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny um well just on
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
that I've heard from a lot of my
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
constituents that they would like to see
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
a workable um bill I I feel like members
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
of this committee and people who came
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
today will into two camps they'll either
 
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
be wanting itl no changes can really fix
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
it for them and then others who want the
 
00:25:38.389 --> 00:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
best product um to to come from
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
amendments um because I think we all
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
probably agree that an amendment is
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
necessary if we were to go forward with
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
it so I I'm not ready to vote on it
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
today I think many members of this
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
committee wouldn't be ready to vote on
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
it today um because an amendment could
 
00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
make it workable and I think a lot of my
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
constituents would like to see an effort
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
to make this bill um as good as possible
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else Mr chair yes
 
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:05.799 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question well I
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill is not ready for
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
prime time and it sounds like it would
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
need a lot of amendments um and a lot of
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
work and a lot of time to get it to
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
where it could be possible or palatable
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
for the residents of the State of New
 
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:23.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm thinking and the that
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
maybe this should have been a
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment as cacr rather
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
than um just an um an LSR because that
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
way it it goes to the question goes to
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
the voters and they get to vote on it
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else any other comments
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent stapon do it in a week
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I've had another bill
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
where I've had so many constituent and
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh other inputs
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
hundreds of emails uh dozens of
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
letters um on both sides of the issue so
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
I haven't made a count but uh you know
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
if it's 45 55 or 5050 or whatever it
 
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.549 align:start position:0%
if it's 45 55 or 5050 or whatever it
might

00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
might
 
00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
might
be

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
um I I have trouble with this bill from
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
at least two points the insurance um
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
class ifying a suicide as not a
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
suicide um represents problems for the
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
insurance industry and life insurance
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
contracts I'm troubled with uh the lack
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
of attendance you know self-
 
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.750 align:start position:0%
of attendance you know self-
Administration

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
um many of my constituents are opposed
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
this from ethical practical and even
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
moral standpoints and so am I and and I
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
believe that the Amendments aren't going
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
to change those
 
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
basic um Holdings and beliefs uh so I'm
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
ready to vote on on this
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
now um I have
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
experienced and been with close friends
 
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:17.750 align:start position:0%
experienced and been with close friends
and

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
relatives in the passing of their
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
lives and have supported them as much as
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
I could and I was very satisfied with
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
the state of pallative care and hospice
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
they know how to administrate the pain
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
medications to the point necessary until
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
the body gives up and systems
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
fail um I am a believer in the sanctity
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
of life from the moment of conception to
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
the moment of natural death and um there
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
there are many hard stories that have
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
touched the heart about pain and S
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
suffering um but I think we got to get
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
this right and
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and self
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
assisted or physician assisted suicide
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
is is not the answer I think we need to
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
concentrate on paliative care and
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
improving that and
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
education uh but I would be a no vote on
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
this bill in any case amendments are no
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be heard yes
 
00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
represent Alexander thank you um for
 
00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:28.039 align:start position:0%
listening to me again I I think maybe
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps the best strategy would be for
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
the committee members that would like to
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
work on this bill they we interm study
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
it and allow the members this summer to
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
work on the bill because it seems like
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
not a single member is ready to vote Yes
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
on the bill today maybe from what I hear
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
so maybe the ones that would like to
 
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
work on the bill work on it over the
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
summer and then the ones that do not
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
want to work on the bill and will not be
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
voting for it take the summer off thank
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
you anyone else else wish to be heard
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
tur yeah I just wanted to say um you
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
know and EO where Walt started uh sorry
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton started um you
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
know if there's division on this and
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
there are potential amendments that may
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
or may not cure issues with the bill for
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
some or more of the members it sort of
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
feels like why wouldn't we finish that
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
process first and get to a place
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
where based on the things that people
 
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
know they want to potentially change
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
that we can evaluate that and and get I
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
don't think our goal is to get to the
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
place where everyone's in agreement it
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
gets to a place where we all feel like
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
we know what we would be voting on so I
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
would be supportive of continuing this
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
and and and hearing those amendments and
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
and then voting you know and seeing
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
where we stand as a group all right
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh uh representative Horan
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much first of all I
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
lifted this issue in my own life just a
 
00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago and I know all 19 of my
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the committee have been
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
thinking and praying for me I'm thankful
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
for that but I think um regardless of
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
what happens to this bill we probably
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
need to raise public awareness of the
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
existing options for pallative and
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
hospice care which I think um maybe not
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
every family that's in crisis is uh is
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
what knows b as many knows about some of
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
the options that already exist under the
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
existing law so even if we pass this
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
today and it goes through it's still
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
like whatever the effective date is so
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
even then there'll be a period of time
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
where people are going to be going
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
through what my family went through so I
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
think um so I think this uh I think this
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
issue I mean I certainly certainly would
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
be better to like consider some
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
amendments and take take another few a
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
little more time to look at it but I
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
think even regardless of what happens um
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
I think there needs to be greater public
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
awareness of what they can do for their
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
family and friends when as happens to
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
everybody they reach they get near the
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
end of life so that's all right that's
 
00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:00.039 align:start position:0%
my two cents so thank and also once
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
again thank thanks everybody in the
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee and many of the people who are
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
sitting in the audience too for their
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
support and I know we'll all need it
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
every the rest of us will all need that
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
same support at some point and I hope
 
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
hope I'll be able to pay pay pay that
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
back so thanks all right representative
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
Perez I
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
agree in any rate to try to EXA this in
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
less than a week from today
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
I do not
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
believe does it justice to be able to uh
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
get the amendments in that people want
 
00:32:40.629 --> 00:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
and absorb the Amendments and then not
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
work on this until you know the towards
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
the end of the day in a week I think
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's way too soon all right all right so
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard yes
 
00:32:49.519 --> 00:32:52.870 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard yes
representative

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
Smith this is what the Democratic
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
process small the Democratic process is
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
all about it is listening to our
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
constituents it's listening to our
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
colleagues it's trying to find a way to
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
get us to yes whatever yes is um hearing
 
00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.110 align:start position:0%
get us to yes whatever yes is um hearing
disperate

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
disperate
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
views and um it's never easy and we
 
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
don't always get it right the first time
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to say but we try one of the
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts that keeps on coming back to me
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
is that um in the fall late fall um
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
UNH um which doesn't always get things
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
right either but nonetheless UNH
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
ran um an independent
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
poll uh h on this very
 
00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
issue and when you look at the
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
results there are some really
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
interesting numbers that come up it's
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
the data that I'm always looking for but
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
reliable um and these aren't people who
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
organized to write to us or to call us
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
um or doing it on their own these are
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
people who are called
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
blindly and uh and as their opinion and
 
00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:31.079 align:start position:0%
when I look at the result and see that
 
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
over 70% of the citizens who were PED in
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
this state
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
support um end of
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
life options we're only talking about an
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
option here an option we're not talking
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
about any demanded um I was fascinated
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
to see that the North country had uh
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
something like 885 per I was really
 
00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
surprised that it was so high and I
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
don't know why but um it might have to
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
do with the fact that they don't
 
00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily have access the way those of
 
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
us in the southern part of the state do
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
to arrange of other services that we all
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
value Hospice pallative Care all of that
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
um gun owners over
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
70% support this and um I think that's
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
something that's really quite quite
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
interesting um to see um people who
 
00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:37.710 align:start position:0%
interesting um to see um people who
identify

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
themselves as
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
religious they chose to identify
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
themselves as religious over 60% and
 
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.310 align:start position:0%
themselves as religious over 60% and
that

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
includes Protestants Jews and Roman
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
Catholics um now these aren't people who
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
were the as you are you are Jewish they
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
therefore how do you believe in the they
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
were asked to identify themselves and I
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
know I know when I do these polls I
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
don't like to tell very much about
 
00:36:09.069 --> 00:36:09.079 align:start position:0%
myself but these are people who chose to
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
so my my point that I'm trying to make
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
is that this room has people who are
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
very caring and who have self- selected
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
to come here we have heard from people
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
who have self- selected to call us
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes a little late in the evening
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
and to write to us or to you know to
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
email us and then we hear from people
 
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:41.960 align:start position:0%
who were just a random group who seemed
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
to think that there is Merit in this and
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
why I completely understand the
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
Divergent views I have no problem with
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
people with different views on this or
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
on anything else because it is the
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
Democratic way but I think we deserve we
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
I think we have an obligation to the 70
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
some OD percent of people who resp who
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
were asked and responded to a
 
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
poll to give this everything that we
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
can I think that on this bill and on a
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
number of other bills this committee's
 
00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:24.069 align:start position:0%
number of other bills this committee's
been

00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
rushed to make a decision before we
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily had an opportunity to weigh
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
all the pluses and minuses and I would
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
put this bill on that list um and think
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a little more time
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
particularly because we have seen that
 
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of interest out there in
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
in the state on this and the one thing
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
we all have in common is that we were
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
all born and we will all die so this
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
affects everyone thank you Mr chair
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
thank you is anyone who hasn't spoken
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
I'm in on the committee that wishes to
 
00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
be heard all right so what I'm going to
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
do uh then is I am going to uh delay a
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
vote on this matter because I think um
 
00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
that representative Smith and
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative tur I agree with their
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
position that um we really we really
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
can't u i I speak as someone who is a
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
supporter of this bill I make it clear
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm a a strong supporter of this
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
bill could it be made better with some
 
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
amendments along the lines of what we've
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
talked about I think it could um and I
 
00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
think we have an obligation to try to do
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
that I understand that there are some
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
people on the committee um uh who who
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
you know no matter uh who whose view is
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
that they could not support this bill uh
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
regardless of the Amendments and I
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
completely understand that and respect
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
their view on that um but I do think I I
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
don't think that there is a reason that
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
this bill needs to be postponed um you
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
know for interim study or something like
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
that the Amendments that I'm talking
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
about are not particularly uh uh uh
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
significant in the overall scheme of
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
things as I understand it although I was
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
never involved in this bill in my last
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
my first term as a legislator um my
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this this
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
something like this bill has gone
 
00:39:24.109 --> 00:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
through um the legislature before and I
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know I I uh if people want more
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
details on that I would refer to people
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
who have been in the legislature longer
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
than I have and were on this committee
 
00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh in earlier terms but I I guess what
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is it's this we are not uh
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
this isn't the the first go around on
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
this bill and there may need to be a a
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
few amendments but I think they're
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
relatively discreet um I think we can
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
get them done hopefully we can get them
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
done it's on the schedule to be uh for
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
the continued executive session
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
next uh uh Wednesday afternoon if it
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
turns out that the you know the uh
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
amendments are more complicated uh than
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
we thought or something it's possible we
 
00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
could end up rescheduling that to I
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
guess it would have to be two weeks
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
later because they're we're not going to
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
be sitting the week of school vacation
 
00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
um but it but at any event I I feel
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
quite confident that we can have a vote
 
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
on this bill at least by uh early March
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
so for that reason I'm going to uh we're
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
not I'm not going to uh take a vote on
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
this bill now so then like next what I'd
 
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
like to do is go on to uh our other
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
agenda and I'm going to turn to uh house
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill 14 1412 dealing with court reporter
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
deregulation and repres recognized
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative cutab for a motion I move
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
OTP is there a second I'll
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
second all right um representative kab
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
would you like me to speak to it
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
whatever um I'll just be really short on
 
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
it I you know I I'm not sure the need
 
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
since we don't have court reporters
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
inside of the court anymore I'm not sure
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
the need to license it I you know
 
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
they're being used privately by private
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
attorneys and I think the private
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys can evaluate the people that
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're using there was they I mean they
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
flat out told us themselves that there
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
are no more court reporters inside of
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
the court so I think we're licensing
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
something that's being used privately
 
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
and that it can be handled privately and
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't need a public license thank you
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
heard oh yes I'm sorry represent Smith
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry okay thank you very much I I
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
wait to be asked um I'm interested to
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
hear what um the maker of the motion
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
said because I happen to think she's
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
terrific um but the art argument that if
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
the if they're not in the
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
courts we shouldn't be involved kind of
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense because to me
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
unless it can be explained we license a
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
lot of people who are not in the courts
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
we we license people we license people
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
who cut hair we license teachers we
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
license all kinds of people the fact
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
that they're not in the court is
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
irrelevant they provide a service that
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
is relied upon um in the judicial
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
process and um as for me I'd like to
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that there people who are
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
trained and
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
qualified and
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
um follow particular standards and so
 
00:42:49.829 --> 00:42:49.839 align:start position:0%
that I know that their
 
00:42:49.839 --> 00:42:51.750 align:start position:0%
that I know that their
certification

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
um of of particular procedures is valid
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
so um while I completely
 
00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.230 align:start position:0%
so um while I completely
respect

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
respect
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
um the maker of the motion I just have
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
to disagree on the conclusion and I
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
would vote um against this motion anyone
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
else wishes to speak representative tur
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah ju just one thing that I came away
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
with from our hearing was um the folks
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
that would be I think given Relief by
 
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
removing this licensing process
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement the process they
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
have to go through and the fees that
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
they have to pay we're all here in
 
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:32.950 align:start position:0%
they have to pay we're all here in
support

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
of continuing that license my
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
understanding I think I even asked is
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
there anyone that they know of that from
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
their constituent group that that might
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
feel that they should get that this
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
should be done away with and they said
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
no and and anyone who's being excluded
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
from the profession um because of the
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement didn't come before
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
our group to to explain that so I don't
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
understand why we would get rid of a
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement that nobody's
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
advocating for us to not have all right
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on so I
 
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
guess I would just um I I have I have
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of long history on on this and
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
I won't I won't bore you now um with the
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
with the details of the long history but
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
what I would what I would say is
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
this all of the arguments
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
that you heard by the by the people who
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
testified in support of continuing to
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
have regulation of court reporters all
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
of those arguments were the very same
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
arguments that were made to the Supreme
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
Court back in 2004 and 2005 for why the
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
court system should not get should not
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
eliminate using Court
 
00:44:56.829 --> 00:44:56.839 align:start position:0%
stenographers we had the the record will
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
be it the record will not be secure
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
there will be um it'll be terrible uh we
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
need the court reporters and I have to
 
00:45:08.109 --> 00:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
say I I want I as I said I don't want to
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
get into a lot of
 
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
detail I was one of the judges on The
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
Superior Court who agreed with those
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
arguments I would have been you know 20
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
years ago I would have been saying the
 
00:45:20.589 --> 00:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
same thing that we heard from
 
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
representative shirtliff about this is
 
00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:25.559 align:start position:0%
terrible if we get rid of the court
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
report orders the records will not the
 
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:29.960 align:start position:0%
record will not be accurate we can't
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
just use uh people uh listening uh
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
people uh monitoring tape recorders
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be absolutely awful um and I
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
thought the Supreme Court was just at
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know this was going to be a
 
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.790 align:start position:0%
you know this was going to be a
catastrophic

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
catastrophic
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
mistake the reality is I was
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
wrong that the the the court system
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
began you replaced the court reporters
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
in fact they brought a lawsuit it went
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court it was a three to
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
two decision in the Supreme Court with
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
with substitute judges back in long
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
before I got to the Supreme Court it was
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
a big
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
deal um but in fact the reality is that
 
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.950 align:start position:0%
deal um but in fact the reality is that
having

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
having
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
non-licensed uh Court monitors who who
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
run the run the the tape recording
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
machine in the court system and the and
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
the the the the tapes get electronically
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
sent to an outfit in Arizona they've
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
been using that for years I just
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
recently checked with the clerk of the
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to make sure they were
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
still using the same outfit they send it
 
00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
to an outfit in Arizona which who who
 
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
does the
 
00:46:38.349 --> 00:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
transcripts it works fine and it saved
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch a substantial amount
 
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.710 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch a substantial amount
of

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
money there is no reason for the state
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
to continue to be involved in the
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
regulation of what we could if we were
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
on if we wanted to be accurate we would
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
say this is a bill regarding non-court
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
reporters because they don't do anything
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the court
 
00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
anymore so the analogy I would ask you
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
to draw is it's it continuing to
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
regulate the court reporters would be
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
like suppose suppose that that we said
 
00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:17.559 align:start position:0%
well major league baseball players don't
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed but if you're
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
playing in the minor leagues you got to
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
have a license I think most people would
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
say why what why why does that make any
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
sense if we
 
00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:33.109 align:start position:0%
sense if we
don't

00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
the the continuing lure of court
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
reporters it seems to me it is simply a
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
matter of of sort of trying to eliminate
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
competition trying to make it trying to
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
make uh prevent people who who um would
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
would do would do outside of the Court
 
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
essentially what the what we refer to
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
now the court monitors the people who
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
use the tape recorders do inside the
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
court prevent them from doing that and
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
right now under the law they are they
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
are prohibited from that because they
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
can't if they um if they uh try to
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
provide Court Reporting Services it's
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
actually a crime it becomes a Class A
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it's as much as I love and
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
respect the court reporters I I mean I
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
think that was we we all in the in the
 
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
court system at the time on the superior
 
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
court at least we all were you know we
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
we felt terrible for what happened to
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
the court reporters but the reality is
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
that there is no legitimate reason for
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
continuing to regulate that if they want
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
to have their certification they can
 
00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
still there's a National Association of
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
court reporters they can still you know
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
tell prospective lawyers that might want
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
to use a deposition someone for a
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
deposition I'm a member of the National
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
Association of court reporters I've been
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
certified by them and maybe lawyers will
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
say I that's what I want but there
 
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
should be no reason that somebody says
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
who has who is willing to uh provide
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
those Services perhaps for less money um
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
by by tape recording the uh the uh the
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
deposition shouldn't be able to do that
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
if they want to so that's that's I'm
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I've spoken longer than I intended
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
to but that's why I think uh this we
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
Bill yes representative Stapleton I was
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
originally opposed to this feeling that
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
we were pulling the rug out from
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
underneath these people who do a fine
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
job and what they do even if it's
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the court and I thought about
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
it a long time and you know technology
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
is replacing the need and the
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
function um you know I'm a railroad guy
 
00:49:50.309 --> 00:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
I used to be a member of the order of
 
00:49:50.319 --> 00:49:51.390 align:start position:0%
I used to be a member of the order of
railroad

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
railroad
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
telegraphers well if you could find a
 
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
telegraph key in a railroad environment
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
anymore they'd be doing something
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
probably a museum so you know all
 
00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
Industries and crafts move forward with
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
technology that's a basis of improvement
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
and professional associations um
 
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
industrial associations will fill the
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
Gap that uh certification withdrawn uh
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
will will leave them so I'm I'm good
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
with the U the OTP anyone else wish to
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
be heard yes representative
 
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
L um I just want to say that I think
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
first of all their lure is very
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
important um because there is not many
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
court reporters that are out there
 
00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
anymore within our state and the ones
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
that we do have um they need to be
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
valued and I think at the same time that
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's very important yes technology
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
is is great but at the same time um they
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
have actually on to um had education
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
within this to do that and it's just
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
like anything doing away with jobs um
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
you think about it um it's their
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
livelihood that some of them have been
 
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
it doing it for 35 years some of us that
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
came to testify so I think we really
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
need to think about it um strongly when
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
we make our decision thank you all right
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard yes
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative manx thank you Mr chair I
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out um the fiscal
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
note um says that the impact is expected
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
to be less than $10,000 in each of the
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal years from 2024 through
 
00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
2027 so whatever the impact is on the
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
court system it's less than $10,000 a
 
00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
year now um it doesn't specify a more
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
specific dollar figure so I don't know
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's closer to the $2,000 range
 
00:51:54.789 --> 00:51:54.799 align:start position:0%
or the $9,000 range I don't but um it
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
seems that at least the fiscal impact on
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
the court is fairly
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
insignificant representative H it's not
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
on the court I'm inclined to leave the
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
law the way it is um there's a obviously
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
here in conquer there certain hostility
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
to professional licensure in general but
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
I think there's I think there's still
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
some value into having licensing and
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps we may even need more regulation
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
of these companies which uh transcribe
 
00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
the recordings because we certainly like
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have another bill in this committee
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
which hinges a lot on like what what's
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
on court transcripts so it's there's
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
some Val there's some value I think in
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
making sure that the even if we are
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
sending them off to Arizona or wherever
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
have these things transcribed that they
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
be uh properly properly transcribed so I
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
think we're I think we'd be losing
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
something by just eliminating uh this
 
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
license even though it is a profession
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's on its way out the time may have
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
passed it by but I think it still has
 
00:52:50.349 --> 00:52:50.359 align:start position:0%
its place so I'm going to be voting
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
against uh the ought to pass which I
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
guess is what the motion will be all
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
right represent Smith
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to make
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
one correction the um it would not be
 
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
the court that would have less than
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh dollar um a year in each of
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
the future fiscal years it's the office
 
00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
of professional liur and certification
 
00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
that's where um the license is a process
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
not in the court anyone else wish to
 
00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:19.799 align:start position:0%
have anything to say on this bill right
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
I think we're ready to uh call the role
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
the motion is uh
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%

so you made the motion for the uh
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
adoption of the amendment was it who
 
00:57:43.029 --> 00:57:43.039 align:start position:0%
seconded that right was that rep Wallace
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.799 --> 00:58:09.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
would you like to explain it to us to
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
read the whole thing no absolutely so so
 
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
you you may
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
recall you may recall that um
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire had a the
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
original bill was
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
to change the definition of
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
cherish from what it meant in
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
1784 to what it means today um and the
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
purpose of this amendment is as I think
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
I may have mentioned at the at the
 
00:58:41.549 --> 00:58:41.559 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
this I understood the intent to to be
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
can't to just be very C with due
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
deference to representative Maguire who
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
I like a lot um I just I thought it was
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
just a little too cutesy I mean it one
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
of the one of the main reasons that I
 
00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
thought that was that the the the
 
00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:04.039 align:start position:0%
definition of cherish in 1784 is not all
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
that different from the definition of
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
cherish today is a little bit different
 
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
but not much um and what it seemed to me
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
what the purpose the entire purpose of
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional amendment was was you
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
know to to
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh to basically say to to overrule The
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision and to essentially
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
say to the Supreme Court whatever you
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
thought cherish meant based on the 17084
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
definition it doesn't mean that anymore
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
and so you're you know it's time to uh
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
it's time to overrule Claremont um I
 
00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.750 align:start position:0%
it's time to overrule Claremont um I
just

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
felt rather than be sort of cutesy about
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
it why not just draft an amendment that
 
00:59:52.029 --> 00:59:52.039 align:start position:0%
said that basically says that that's
 
00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
what you're doing and so this the
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
language that that I propose to add to
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
cac12 um says this provided further
 
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
however that the duty to cherish the
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
interest of literature and the sciences
 
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
and all seminaries and public schools
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
does not require the state to provide
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
funding for public or private schools or
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
other educational institutions at any
 
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
particular level the legislator shall
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
have exclusive authority to determine
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
the amount of such funding the purposes
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
for which such expend shall be uh made
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
and the sources of funding thereof
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
including the extent to which counties
 
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
towns cities and unincorporated places
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
shall contribute uh funding for these
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
purposes and no court shall have
 
01:00:41.069 --> 01:00:41.079 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to review set aside or
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
modify any decisions made by the
 
01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:46.039 align:start position:0%
legislature with regard to these matters
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
so that I mean that's basically that
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
that sort of says
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
what what I think the law was uh before
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
Claremont and what I think the law
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
should be today yeah I would like to
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
congratulate the chair for being
 
01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely and completely
 
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
honest in this amendment and I too like
 
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire and we have
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
worked together on many uh many issues
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
not exactly this one um because I happen
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
to believe in three branches of
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
government legislative executive and
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
judicial even though the judicial branch
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
Now does not happen to have the benefit
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
of the former Chief Justice there are
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
other moderately competent
 
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
people um in the um in the judicial
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
branch and I also believe that there is
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
nothing that is more
 
01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
important in a democ Democratic small D
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
Democratic Society then public
 
01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
education um I could not possibly
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
support any amendment that removes one
 
01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
branch of the government from something
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
as important as public
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
education and I would suggest on this
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
one um Mr chair there's probably no need
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
to have extensive debate because I think
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
we can probably predict what is going to
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
happen um on the vote and we might as
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
well just go right ahead to the vote for
 
01:02:43.150 --> 01:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
those people who don't believe that the
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
judicial branch should have any role in
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
protecting access in a Democratic
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
Society to public education and those
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
people who do and will vote and then
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
we'll go on from there and probably no
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
positions will be changed thank you
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh yes representative Greece
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
just for the record we have a Republic
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
small R uh form of government that uses
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
Democratic principles small D but uh
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's all just point of contention
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
other um anyone else uh yes
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative Staples well thank you Mr
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for bringing forth
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment um I was uncertain as to
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
how to parse this out and where to go
 
01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
with it but if we look at the conval and
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
the ran lawsuit decisions they squarely
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
put the obligation um for um the matter
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
legislature and this amendment um states
 
01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:50.119 align:start position:0%
that so I thought we brought two maybe
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
opposing sides somewhat together with
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment thank you and um I'm good
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
with the amendment all right anyone else
 
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard representative organ
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
well I guess ran Smith pretty much said
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
it all but that last sentence um I don't
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
totally don't see how that could work I
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
mean I guess a constitutional provision
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
can't be unconstitutional but I'm not
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
sure how given what we say about the
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
courts and the rest of the Constitution
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
how we can shut them out of that one uh
 
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
subject area I mean the we had the
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision and the other ones
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
but the problem that it's not really the
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
Court's fault problem is the legislature
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
has been refusing to follow the
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution and also if you're talking
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
about funding for any level that's kind
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
of strange but also like you're leaving
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
out the uh of course you're leaving out
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account or School
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
voucher uh providers so we're not
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
although I guess you know so we're not
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be obligated to fund
 
01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
that program either if we pass this
 
01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment which I mean
 
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily bother me
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
personally but I think so I think think
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
this uh Amendment it's it's it's
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
interesting but I don't think it uh just
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
totally doesn't work for me especially
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
that last sentence just I that's going
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
to create massive confusion and finally
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of pleasantly surprised at
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
least that uh they wanted to stick with
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
the 2024 definition of cherish usually
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
they're talking about how people thought
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
of things in the 18th century as well as
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
the 21st century it's because they want
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
us to go back to the 21st to the 18th
 
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
century so at least at least that part
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
of debate is somewhat encouraging but
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still like a you I'm I'm still
 
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
not supportive of this amendment at all
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
so but it's it's a it's very it's very
 
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
interesting though but thanks right any
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
other any any other comments uh
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative line I'm almost afraid to
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
but don't we open the door to when we
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
start playing cutesy with you know
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
passing potential bills like this and
 
01:05:55.269 --> 01:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
changing words like cherish and then
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
just bringing them up to date couldn't
 
01:06:01.269 --> 01:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
one you know later on turn around and
 
01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
bring another bill forward say with the
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms and say this phrase
 
01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:10.640 align:start position:0%
does not jive with what wants what what
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
people want to happen now so let's
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
change it now and make it more of what's
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
politically correct in
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
2024 as opposed to what was politically
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
correct in 1776 or whatever
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
why would we be looking at that that's
 
01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:29.799 align:start position:0%
where I'm kind of having a problem with
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
this this is a play on words and I don't
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
think we should be even addressing it in
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
this room that's where I stand okay
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
heard yes
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
repres so I really don't like that the
 
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
initial bill
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't more clear on what the intent was
 
01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
and I do like that the amendment is
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
clear on the intent on what the intent
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
is I don't think that it's fair to put
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
something potentially out to voters that
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
they're not going to
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
understand what it even means when
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
you're putting something out there I
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
mean I can't imagine getting this as a
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
voter and and seeing okay we're going to
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
change the word cherish to cherish
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
voters are going to be so confused going
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
why are we changing a word to the same
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
word so I do like that the amendment
 
01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:22.069 align:start position:0%
word so I do like that the amendment
makes

01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
however I think that we've always kind
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
of valued education and I'm not sure
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
that I like that
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
it's solely leaving it up
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
without anybody being able to oversee it
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how I feel about it but I I
 
01:07:45.069 --> 01:07:45.079 align:start position:0%
do like that the amendment is kind of
 
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
more clear on it um and I
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
do I guess I'm I'm kind
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
of a little little bit uh unsure where
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
to go on this one thanks anyone else
 
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
wish to be heard representative D
 
01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr chair you know this
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
is confusing the bill is confusing the
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is a little bit more clear but
 
01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:10.390 align:start position:0%
amendment is a little bit more clear but
when

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
we when a secretary of state draws up
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
the question on the ballots what exactly
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
is it going to say it's so it's it's
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
it's on there it's on it's on the it's
 
01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
in the bill what it will
 
01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
see okay so that's it that's fine thank
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
you anyone else wish to be heard so you
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
know the only other the only other thing
 
01:08:46.510 --> 01:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
that I would say on this is and
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
I you know I I understand uh both
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
representative kutab and representative
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
Smith's U point about the
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
court my problem is and this is the this
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
really is the I think is the heart of
 
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:04.759 align:start position:0%
the Claremont the heart of the Claremont
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
matter if we don't do something like
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
this this will never end the important
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
thing I think the the most disturbing
 
01:09:16.269 --> 01:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
part about Claremont is that by creating
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
this this sort of affirmative right this
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
affirmative constitutional right that
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
anybody can exercise
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
the funding thing will never end
 
01:09:29.070 --> 01:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
there'll there's this this litigation
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
now it'll go to the Supreme Court the
 
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court will do what whatever they
 
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
let let's
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
assume that that the Supreme Court
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
affirms the trial court and says uh I
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
think what it was $77,000 in per student
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
or something is what a minimum uh
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
require that's that that'll be good
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
until somebody gets the idea that they
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
should be spending more and then
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
there'll be another lawsuit and it'll go
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
on and on and and on and that's why it
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
just seems to
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
me the legislature is the body that is
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
rep that is elected and representative
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
of the people and should be the ones
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
that make these decisions so that's why
 
01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
I think this is important um but anyway
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know understand this is as as I've
 
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
said to my co as I say it public there's
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
been nobody in leadership on the on my
 
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle has been sort of
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
trying to Strongarm anybody on this so I
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
encourage all of you to vote your
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
conscience on
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
this Mr chair can I say one quick sure
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely to representative D Lorenzo's
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
Point um I don't know if it matters but
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
in the amendment the new language on the
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
final page that inserts your language
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
from page two isn't bolded so I don't
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
know if the amendment is fully clear
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
that it's also adding that in what would
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
ballot that I mean that's a good point I
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
think from my understanding of Prior
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendments that they
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
generally don't on the ballot itself
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't put that in I think that's
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's the way they they
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
typically do it okay I was just
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
questioning the the form of the
 
01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
amendment not not the content to the
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
amendment right now I hear you all right
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
um anyone else wish to be heard all
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
right so I guess I would ask the uh
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role well we can do it
 
01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
by on the amend let's call the role on
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay all right sure that's
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
fine no that's
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%

01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
Reon that's interesting I I would have
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
to check with the clerk on that
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
because we were really voting only on
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment right um and if I can help
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
to I think me may want to change their
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
vote between the amendment and the in
 
01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:30.639 align:start position:0%

that so you would like to go I mean I
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
think we should have a full vote on the
 
01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:43.880 align:start position:0%

Mr chair I have a huge problem with this
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill I think that the Human Rights
 
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
Commission has this right when they say
 
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
that when you add more language it
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
actually does a disservice to people
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
that are being discriminated against by
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
adding more specific language than
 
01:18:27.629 --> 01:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
leaving the whole ethnicity I think the
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission is right so I'm
 
01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:30.440 align:start position:0%
definitely voting against that motion

01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
it really quickly so again this the
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is to remove the
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
collection of race and An ancestry from
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
Marriage applications um and the
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is to additionally move the
 
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
level of
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
Education that that's pretty much it all
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
right anyone else that wish to be heard
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
on uh the amend
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yes representative Perez I just
 
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
want to say that once again I think for
 
01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
future for future Generations it is
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
important to have the
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
ethnicity on the marriage certificate so
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
that when they look back when names have
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
changed over and over and over again and
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
they have no idea when they look back
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
they can see where their
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
relatives came from because a lot of
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
things come up later
 
01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
or I think for medical reasons if
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
nothing else it should be on there all
 
01:23:11.629 --> 01:23:11.639 align:start position:0%
right anyone else um wish to be yes I
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
don't think it's really necessary to
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
have the um ethnicity on the marriage
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
ancestry on the marriage report because
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh DNA is widely available for everyone
 
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
right other anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
all right so this is going to be a vote
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
on the amendment I would propose to do
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
that by show of hands unless somebody
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
objects all right so um show of hands
 
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:39.880 align:start position:0%

minority all
 
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
right all right um so what I would um
 
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do uh on House Bill
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
1432 um I
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
think we're by we're yeah I'm going to
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
recess the executive session on that
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
because I think we're basically in the
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
same position on that bill as we were on
 
01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
1283 um there are some amendments that
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
have been um uh sort of baned about I
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
mean I haven't nothing's been filed yet
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
but um there have been some
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
amendments um that I I think ought to be
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
considered before uh before we have a a
 
01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the bill um and so
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
that uh I'm going to recess the uh the
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
hearing ing on that and we'll take that
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
up um next Wednesday if we have time and
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
if we don't have time then because we're
 
01:27:02.270 --> 01:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
we're too busy then we'll move it over
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
to to after that but I think that's I
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
think that's really an important bill
 
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping I know that there have
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
been some uh uh some people have
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
expressed an in uh a opposition to the
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
bill initially but I'm hoping that maybe
 
01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
with the Amendments we may be able to
 
01:27:21.870 --> 01:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
get um we may be able to come to more of
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
a consensus on it uh then next I'm going
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
to turn to um House Bill uh
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll uh recognize myself um
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
with regard to that and uh move uh in
 
01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate is there a second
 
01:27:50.189 --> 01:27:50.199 align:start position:0%
I second all right seconded by
 
01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh and so uh let me just um
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
State briefly as I can why I think itl
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
is the
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate the the person who who
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
testified about these slap lawsuits I
 
01:28:14.430 --> 01:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
believe he was an attorney from
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um was obviously very
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in this area and um
 
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:22.280 align:start position:0%
apparently has drafted these kind of
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
bills for other states um I looked at
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
the bill I looked at the uh the bill
 
01:28:33.310 --> 01:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
very carefully um and I I know I asked
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
representative Paige if he had a chance
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
to look at if he would have a chance to
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
look at it and what his impression was
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to ask him about that in a
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
minute but my my impression
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
about the bill was that although there
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
was talk about this making substantial
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
substantive changes to the
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
law it really doesn't if you look if you
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
look at the bill what it essentially
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
does is in lawsuits that might be
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
characterized as um being brought
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
against somebody either as a claim or a
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
counter claim um to try to
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
prevent them from exercising their
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
rights of expression all this bill does
 
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
really is to say that in those kind of
 
01:29:29.109 --> 01:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
cases there can
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
be kind of an expedited motion to
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
dismiss and a requirement that the
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
plaintiff in those kind of cases come
 
01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.830 align:start position:0%
plaintiff in those kind of cases come
forth

01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
with with um its evidence if you will at
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
an earlier stage than might otherwise be
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
the case under the normal rules of the
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
Court it does doesn't change in any way
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
the substantive law um and
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
so you know is that a particular value
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
to have to be able to resolve cases more
 
01:30:07.990 --> 01:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
quickly in some
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances you know
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
arguably but the problem
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
is I have we didn't really hear any
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
evidence that there's that this is a
 
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
problem in New Hampshire that people are
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
bringing you know these kind of lawsuits
 
01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh to stop public participation in New
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I didn't hear any evidence
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
about that in the time that I you know
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
spent it as a judge I didn't see that
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
this was uh I'm not I'm not saying that
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
there was never a case like this I don't
 
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
know I I can't remember one off hand but
 
01:30:41.790 --> 01:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
um it certainly wasn't something that
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
was sort of you know an epidemic that
 
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
requires some some uh specialized
 
01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
procedures so for those reasons I I just
 
01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:52.990 align:start position:0%
procedures so for those reasons I I just
think

01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh it ain't broke don't fix it that's
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
but representative Paige I I I asked you
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
if uh if you have a different view I'm
 
01:31:04.109 --> 01:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
I'm all ears so as a former Elementary
 
01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:06.280 align:start position:0%
School teacher to say I didn't do my
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
homework very well I will say that now
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
um my initial sort of 30,000 foot view
 
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
where there's some there may have been
 
01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of jurisdictional issues in
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
um State claims and feder court that oh
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
the FED no you're right is a real issue
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
that issue with with this that I'm not
 
01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
sure has been resolved so um but I I
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
concur that I don't see this as a
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
necessary U action if that's what I'm
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
understanding you say but no and you
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
rais a very valid point there's some
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
language in there about what the what
 
01:31:44.669 --> 01:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
what the federal courts would have to do
 
01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure would would be
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh under the supremacy
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
clause but I but you know that's that
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's so that's another issue but I
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
think the main reason for me is I just
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't see that this is necessary anyone
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez I just want to
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
say these things are happening maybe
 
01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
they didn't when you were on the bench
 
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
but these things are happening
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
especially in small towns that people
 
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
are lawsuits are being pushed against
 
01:32:14.669 --> 01:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
people um and I think this is not the
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
wording perhaps or it needs to be redone
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
but we do have you know people that are
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities are going after people
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
and putting things on them for no
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
Justified reason so all right anyone
 
01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
else wish to be heard on
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
this all right uh then I the motion is
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%

01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
um oh
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
1412 you and K I think yeah
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
right uh all right on House Bill
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
1603 uh this is the
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.070 align:start position:0%
1603 uh this is the
um

01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that uh would I I guess
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
the intent was to um
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh municipalities or local
 
01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
governmental bodies
 
01:34:04.679 --> 01:34:06.550 align:start position:0%
governmental bodies
from

01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:34:09.390 --> 01:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
passing passing laws that would prevent
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
would prohibit women from being topless
 
01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
uh where men were allowed to be topless
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
that uh that if I recall from
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative hein's testimony that was
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
the basic purpose of the bill as you may
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
know there was a Supreme Court decision
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
that said that that was that was it
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't unconstitutional to do that um so
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
bill anyone want all right well then I
 
01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:45.750 align:start position:0%
will draws the short
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:48.750 align:start position:0%
will draws the short
[Laughter]

01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:34:52.510 --> 01:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
STW all right uh motion itl
 
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
all right is there a
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
second I second all right second all
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
right um so all right um representative
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
Stapleton do you wish to be heard at all
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
on your
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
motion well un I got a note here um
 
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
problematic and
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
unintended results um and maybe when we
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
have like in 396 uh enabled Separation
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
by the Sexes this might be
 
01:35:27.070 --> 01:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
running um contrary to that and creates
 
01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:28.750 align:start position:0%
running um contrary to that and creates
a

01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
problem so I'm
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
might on it
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
um anyone else wish to be heard on uh
 
01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.870 align:start position:0%
um anyone else wish to be heard on uh
1603

01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
1603
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
yes well two good reasons it one is it
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
goes far beyond um course I was not at
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
the hearing but it goes far beyond what
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
apparently was now former representative
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
hein's original intent but also the way
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's worded I'm not usually these well
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably in the wrong committee too
 
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
probably should have been a municipal
 
01:35:59.590 --> 01:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
and County government but that's fine we
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
can handle it but the talks about the
 
01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places they don't can't
 
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
do anything on their own the County
 
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
government stands in place of the uh
 
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
unincorporate place and usually I think
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
the language probably been more
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate is a political subdivision
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
that then that that also takes in school
 
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
districts and Village districts which
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
might also want to discriminate against
 
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
people on the basis of race or sex so
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
like aside from aside from the fact I
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
think the basic idea is not a great one
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's even if you like the idea it's not
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
really a well- worded way to do it so
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
all right thanks um anyone else who
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
should be heard on this
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill all right then I guess we're ready
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
to uh call the role the motion is itl on
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%

uh I had distributed an amendment to
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
this bill it is
 
01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
0698 H um and I'd like to make the
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
otpa um 1037 with that Amendment all
 
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%

Smith is it
7:13

01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
7:13
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
699 yeah it's a 1037 is the bill and
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
0698 is the amendment I sent it around
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
in paper form and I emailed it yesterday
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
but uh I have extra copies of that if
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
anyone needs
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.119 --> 01:39:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.589 align:start position:0%
 
sh

01:39:22.589 --> 01:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
sh
 
01:39:25.390 --> 01:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
all right um represent would you like to
 
01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh yeah that's
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea um so uh this uh
 
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment actually modifies the bill
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
very significantly um it basically takes
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
out the the main Clause of the original
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
Bill and replaces it with um
 
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
modification to the language that that
 
01:39:51.629 --> 01:39:51.639 align:start position:0%
essentially uh only changes two words in
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
the um in the underlying law as it
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
stands um which seems fairly minor it
 
01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:01.639 align:start position:0%
but it does have real um implications
 
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
and I think benefits for uh the way that
 
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
this works currently um I will
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
say um the reason for this as we went
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
around the discussion there was there
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
that we that the the the idea that a an
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
organization manufacturer dealer that
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
that hasn't committed um any crimes
 
01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:32.199 align:start position:0%
should should not be pierced in this
 
01:40:34.990 --> 01:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
immunity um I will say there's a lot
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
that could be said I'm going to try and
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
avoid saying most of it but we'll answer
 
01:40:38.199 --> 01:40:40.430 align:start position:0%
avoid saying most of it but we'll answer
questions

01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
um there was the Chester arms case
 
01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court settlement just a couple
 
01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
of weeks earlier than this hearing that
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
um spoke that that modified or or at
 
01:40:52.990 --> 01:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
least clarified some of the Clauses in
 
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
the provision that this was relating to
 
01:40:59.950 --> 01:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
um I think in a nutshell the the the the
 
01:41:07.310 --> 01:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
thought behind this um is that the way
 
01:41:11.589 --> 01:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
it stands right now a civil liability uh
 
01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:16.159 align:start position:0%
case brought um can be only pierced
 
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
using results of a completely different
 
01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.510 align:start position:0%
using results of a completely different
case

01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
um which would be a Civ a criminal
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding against um the manufacturer
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or um a dealer of of the
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
weapons so there would have to be a
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
criminal case brought and a criminal
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
case decided and then the results of
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
that would have bearing on whether a
 
01:41:44.189 --> 01:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
civil case could be brought um and
 
01:41:47.229 --> 01:41:47.239 align:start position:0%
basically the change from the language
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
of convicted of to that committed brings
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
the requirements to understand whether
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
or not um those entities committed um an
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
underlying felonious act would be heard
 
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
as part of the civil suit rather than
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
hinging on an external
 
01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
um an external lawsuit that's not really
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
part of the the the Civil proceeding um
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
and I will say
 
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
um I I will I will give deference I'm
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
not saying I want to make clear
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn did not say he
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
supports in any way this but helped um
 
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
think through the the concept underlying
 
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
this so did OLS that essentially when
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
you do that you also change the standard
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
of of proof um because a civil
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding has a preponderance of
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
evidence standard whereas a criminal
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
proceeding has a Beyond A Reasonable
 
01:42:48.589 --> 01:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
Doubt standard so it's not saying that
 
01:42:53.550 --> 01:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have to have committed a a um
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
felonious act in order to in order to
 
01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
pierce theun just it just it puts the
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
standard in alignment with the Civil
 
01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
proceeding that this bill that this um
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
RSA speaks to so I'll stop there and
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
there may be questions all right so um
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
so anyone else uh wish to be heard so I
 
01:43:15.629 --> 01:43:15.639 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say is I I was happy
 
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
to work with with uh representative uh
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
tur on the on the amendment he he he
 
01:43:24.589 --> 01:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
asked and I thought I had I thought I
 
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
could be helpful but I what I would say
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
and I say this very strongly is um
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative tur makes what in my view
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
is like a completely horrible bill into
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
only a very bad bill um uh uh and it
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
does make it does make a very
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
significant change in the law as be uh
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
because as as he said it would
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
significantly weaken the Firearms
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
immunity uh statute because it would
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
instead of having to uh have a
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
conviction that's already in place
 
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
beyond a reasonable doubt this would
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
allow somebody to prove in the civil
 
01:44:15.629 --> 01:44:15.639 align:start position:0%
case that there was a crime that there
 
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
was a that the dealer committed some
 
01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
kind of a crime um this
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
I can't emphasize strongly enough with
 
01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
or without the amendment this bill is a
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
is the beginning of a death Nell to the
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
Firearms industry so um I uh I urge um I
 
01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
urge people to vote against the
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and then against the
 
01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:45.270 align:start position:0%
amendment and then against the
underlying

01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
Bill representative
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
stapon thank you Mr chair um
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
I have difficulty getting my head around
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
that in spite of good attempt by my
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
colleague to explain it um I got the
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
difference between a civil and criminal
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
liability but I still puzzled as to why
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
that those are connected in this
 
01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
instance um example might be helpful but
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
I can't conceive of one
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
um I just because I don't understand it
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
I I can't vote for the for the Amendment
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
with without a lot of additional thought
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I haven't got the time for that so
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
I've got to oppose the amendment all
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
right any anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:45:32.189 --> 01:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:45:35.950 --> 01:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
amendment I I have to agree with you

Mr chair could I ask for ad oh excuse me

01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
allowed the the importance of the
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
presence of this industry in the state
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
jobs it affects the whole state economy
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.030 align:start position:0%

01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
important there are just as there are on
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
many bills that we have in this
 
01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.589 align:start position:0%
many bills that we have in this
committee

01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:48:51.599 --> 01:48:52.510 align:start position:0%
committee
there

01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
are difficult decisions that have to be
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
made in terms of
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
balancing the pluses and the minuses the
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
goods and the bads and violating or
 
01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with what I'm going to
 
01:49:14.990 --> 01:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
call oh I don't want to call it that
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
what kind of
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
preconditioned positions on
 
01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
bills um let me give you just one
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
example and I hope no one's going to
 
01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
groan and
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
moan um when I first was here the
 
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
presence of the
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
NRA was incredibly important for many
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
reasons including the way they
 
01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
contributed to the cost of so many of
 
01:49:51.870 --> 01:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
our colleagues campaigns
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
that has now changed over the
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
years and it's relevant because some of
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
realities I
 
01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
personally do not want to see an
 
01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:11.950 align:start position:0%
personally do not want to see an
important

01:50:11.950 --> 01:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
industry forced out of the
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
state I personally believe that as a
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
country we have a
 
01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:24.950 align:start position:0%
country we have a
problem

01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:50:30.669 --> 01:50:30.679 align:start position:0%
with the way our Firearms are available
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
to so many people it happens just
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday that apparently as part of
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
celebrating the Super Bowl it's
 
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
important to use Firearms I know and
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room knows that no
 
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturer of firearm arms want them
 
01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:54.679 align:start position:0%
to be used that way I don't have any
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
question about that and I would imagine
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
that in another environment those
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers would be willing to stand
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
that I think that somewhere there must
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
be a way for us to address the problem
 
01:51:17.069 --> 01:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
of the misuse of
 
01:51:17.079 --> 01:51:18.950 align:start position:0%
of the misuse of
firearms

01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
firearms
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.669 align:start position:0%
firearms
without

01:51:20.669 --> 01:51:20.679 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
hurting an important
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
industry I don't know what that answer
 
01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.990 align:start position:0%
industry I don't know what that answer
is

01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
but my problem is I don't want to
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
vote Yes on this bill I don't think it's
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
a good bill and I will say that
 
01:51:41.910 --> 01:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is being taped
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
and it can now be used against me but
 
01:51:47.790 --> 01:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
either way I guess is what my problem is
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so what I'm wondering is would the
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
committee consider the
 
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
us sending this
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
study to see if maybe we could come up
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
with a way that honors the import
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
missuse is not in anybody's
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
interest I don't know if there's a way
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do that but I don't think anybody who
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
who who respects the
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
industry wants to see people at a Super
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
Bowl kids at a Super Bowl
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
shot at or killed or whatever and I I
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
really believe that so is there is there
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
some way that we can come up with a
 
01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
brilliant idea and could we do it by um
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
bill I well if if a motion is
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
possible at this point I've now lost
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
track representative Bon's probably
 
01:53:20.589 --> 01:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
right on it I've lost track track of
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
exactly where we are in parliamentary
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
procedure but if there were a
 
01:53:31.229 --> 01:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
time when I could make that motion I
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
would um and uh rather than find myself
 
01:53:41.229 --> 01:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
and others in a position of having to
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish what we want to
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish and it's a problem and I need
 
01:54:00.510 --> 01:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
help so I guess my my sense is I think
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
we do uh U I think we do need to vote on
 
01:54:07.669 --> 01:54:07.679 align:start position:0%
OTP and then if there's an itl motion on
 
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
itl but the other thing I would the
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
other thing I would say representative
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
Smith is I think at least I'm speaking
 
01:54:15.550 --> 01:54:15.560 align:start position:0%
for myself here I don't know if my
 
01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues agree I just feel so strongly
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
that this bill is is just that this bill
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
needs to die FR to be candid about it
 
01:54:28.109 --> 01:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that there's
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
anything that I can conceive of that
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
would per persuade me to uh you know to
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
think that some kind of a change or
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and I and the other concern
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
I have is I think even the the the fact
 
01:54:47.229 --> 01:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
that something other than this bill
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
dying happens um is itself sending a
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
signal I think to uh to uh the industry
 
01:54:59.510 --> 01:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
and so I while I respect very much what
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
you say I I I just I have to say I
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
disagree so I think we I think we
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
probably need to vote on the OTP motion
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh at this point um Mr chair could I
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
also just ask you another question is
 
01:55:13.629 --> 01:55:13.639 align:start position:0%
that clock
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
right yeah we got to get going to caucus
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
so so can we call the question on this
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
to get going have a a c a no so do we so
 
01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:24.679 align:start position:0%
do we so I so we have six minutes left
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's 11:54 let's at least let's at least
 
01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
get this bill out of the way I guess I
 
01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
would propose representative H um yes I
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
now we'll have five and a half minutes
 
01:55:37.069 --> 01:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
so I I'm a co-sponsor this bill there's
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
a major gun manufacturer that has
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
invested probably hundreds of millions
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
of dollars in my in the area where I
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
live and I have no problem with that and
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
I think they would stay regardless of
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not they they move move
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
they've had in addition the concern
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
about misuse of guns they did have a PR
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
product liability issue back about the
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
time when the original law that this
 
01:55:59.550 --> 01:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
bill would overturn was passed and I
 
01:56:01.870 --> 01:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
will say I've I'm satisfied that they've
 
01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
been dealing with that product liability
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
issue as responsibly as they can so um
 
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote Yes on the OTP but I I
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
I'm won't be shocked if that does fail
 
01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%
if that does not get a majority of the
 
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
committee so thanks representative Kenny
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
I moveed to call the question because we
 
01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:20.030 align:start position:0%
I moveed to call the question because we
like

01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
so that's actually precisely my point I
 
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
feel I think representative Smith has
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
brought up a lot of good points that
 
01:56:30.589 --> 01:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
warrant further discussion I've felt the
 
01:56:33.709 --> 01:56:33.719 align:start position:0%
vibe that we do rush through some things
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
and and I don't know why I don't think
 
01:56:37.149 --> 01:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
it's productive I I don't want to call
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
the question when people still want to
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
have a discussion on a bill and um I
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
understand we have a lot to get through
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
but I'm uncomfortable taking a vote on
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
this when we know members still want to
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
have a discussion and I concur on that
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
especially on a bill that's important
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
that we started the vote though and now
 
01:56:55.229 --> 01:56:55.239 align:start position:0%
we have to get to caucus in 5 minutes we
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
have a motion on the table we have to
 
01:56:59.709 --> 01:56:59.719 align:start position:0%
get to CAU that's the problem yeah I'm
 
01:57:01.870 --> 01:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna vote it's just a point
 
01:57:06.470 --> 01:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
of inquiry point of inquiry what pardon
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
is it possible I guess and Mr G
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative gon might be able to
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
answer the question is is it
 
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
procedurally possible someone withdraw
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
the motion are we already in the
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
process can I withdraw my
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.390 align:start position:0%
process can I withdraw my
motion

01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
I I think if it fails we can oh I think
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
if it fails then we can recess the
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
executive session until next week so
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:32.079 --> 01:57:36.669 align:start position:0%
 
eff

01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
so um so per per representative gon my
 
01:57:43.069 --> 01:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
understanding is the motion is still my
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
motion because there hasn't been OTP by
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:51.030 align:start position:0%
anyone else
right

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
no you can you can withdraw your motion
 
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
of OTP you can withd do that you can do
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if that helps the
 
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
cause my goal would my goal would be to
 
01:58:03.470 --> 01:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
continue this I want here's what here's
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
what I saying is I want I my if you move
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
if you withdraw the OTP we will not have
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
a vote on OTP the next motion will be my
 
01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
motion itl and we will have a vote on
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I'll withdraw the motion
 
01:58:26.669 --> 01:58:26.679 align:start position:0%
all right so then I would move it I
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
would move itl on I second Mr chair
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
second all right all right so anyone any
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
further seconded that motion Alexander
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
no no wait who seconded rep Alexander
 
01:58:40.589 --> 01:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
second who who
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
seconded Eric's motion no you did I
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
thought I did yeah
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
um right
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.270 --> 01:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
to Mr chair I would like to take a
 
01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
recess because of the fact that both
 
01:59:04.109 --> 01:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
that all of us in this room have
 
01:59:06.350 --> 01:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
caucuses that start at
 
01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
noon and I am not quite ready to
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.239 --> 01:59:43.069 align:start position:0%
 
motion

01:59:43.069 --> 01:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.239 --> 01:59:52.149 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
know here's here's here's the thing I
 
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
think I think it's got to I will recess
 
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
this so you have more time to think what
 
02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
I was say I I don't think that I don't
 
02:01:01.589 --> 02:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
know if you
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
can I'm GNA call the I don't because we
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
need give me a second I'm call I don't
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
caness I think I think we I think we
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
need because no because no because what
 
02:01:20.390 --> 02:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is this I'm more thany
 
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
I think I think on the floor it I think
 
02:01:26.069 --> 02:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
on the floor we would kill the spill
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
because I think some of on the floor
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
here's think
 
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
that what
 
02:01:55.229 --> 02:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
you yeah no no no
 
02:01:59.950 --> 02:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
I I I hear you I hear all
 
02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:04.790 align:start position:0%
I I I hear you I hear all
right

02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
so all right so I think I'm unless she
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
recess right no exactly
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
exactly that is absolutely true but m my
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
obligation is to be
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
here I don't think I'm noted to to walk
 
02:02:31.229 --> 02:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
that right no I think that's what she's
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what representative K
 
02:02:37.229 --> 02:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
problem is we're in the voting
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
mod no we're technically in the voting
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:47.960 --> 02:03:10.430 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
think no
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
that if I'm going to unless unless Smith
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
tells me I can't resar I'm going to
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
resar because I I I don't I don't you
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
know I don't like the idea of of sort of
 
02:03:33.679 --> 02:03:39.669 align:start position:0%
know I don't like the idea of of sort of
forcing

02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'm well if
 
02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
we no so you know what if we've if uh
 
02:03:53.069 --> 02:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
here's what I'm going to do I'm going to
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
recess the the committee meeting if I if
 
02:03:59.109 --> 02:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
if we're told that we can't recess I
 
02:04:00.189 --> 02:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
assume that the only thing that would
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
mean is that we have to vote over again
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
