00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
at this point i feel it's important to
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
speak why the original bill
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh was amended by the senate it was
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
amended to delete any references to the
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%

professional licensure and certification
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.630 align:start position:0%
to dhhs though this makes administrative
sense

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
the senate had several concerns with the
 
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:06.150 align:start position:0%
the senate had several concerns with the
move

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
first dhhs seeks to use pdmp data for
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
public health programs and analyses
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
but the program was never intended to be
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
used for public health purposes
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
it was intended to identify individuals
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
not to analyze populations
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
any such potential expansion of the
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
program's intent merits careful scrutiny
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
by this legislature
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
prior to its implementation and will be
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
the subject of future legislation
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
second the legislature's privacy mandate
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
regarding use of pdmp data was clear and
 
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.110 align:start position:0%
regarding use of pdmp data was clear and
unambiguous

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
unambiguous
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
cacr
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
that added article 2b to our new
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
prioritizing our personal privacy as a
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional matter
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
clearly data privacy is of permanent
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
importance to the people of new
 
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.269 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a dhhs attempt to provide
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
pdmp data to the federal government to
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
garner grant funding was discovered
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
and prompted the senate mindful of the
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
obvious data privacy concerns
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
to remove dhhs data sharing provisions
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
from this bill
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
and to address it in separate
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
legislation this concludes my testimony
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 45 i ask for your
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%

to improve the utility of the pdmp while
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
scrupulously maintaining the privacy of
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%

you hear me
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
now i can't hear you now sir
 
00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:49.750 align:start position:0%

sorry

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
feedback in the background
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
are we better now we're better now okay
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
good uh given that
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 section 39 repeals the
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
section of why that is filled with
 
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.190 align:start position:0%
section of why that is filled with
demand

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
and given that these data sharing
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
provisions are really quite important
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any feelings about
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps you're introducing this
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
language to house bill 2
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
is an amendment so it goes to rsa 146 a
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh as uh the uh obedient reasons for the
 
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh they move to that section of
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
the statutes and having our committee
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
retain this bill so that you can work
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
with us to fix any issues that were made
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
after the passing of the blessing i i'm
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
amenable to whatever gets the job done
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative and uh as we all know the
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
vaguers of the political process can
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes be confounding and frustrating
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to uh
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know to do whatever it takes to get
 
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:46.550 align:start position:0%
you know to do whatever it takes to get
this

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
into legislation it's good legislation
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh that will enable for example uh the
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
nursing profession
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh the licensing boards for nursing
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
doctors and so forth
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
to assist those members of their
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
professions that are struggling with
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
drug abuse or misuse so again
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
i think it's an important an important
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
addition and whatever it takes to get it
 
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.269 align:start position:0%
addition and whatever it takes to get it
there

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you i agree with you and i
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate your flexibility because we
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have a question for
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
i have to reveal my total ignorance on
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
this it sounds like
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
in your explanation that we are trying
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
people who should not be who are
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
drug dependent and yet the other
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
issue seems to be we're protecting
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
people's private medical privacy
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
could you clarify the intent of this
 
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.629 align:start position:0%
could you clarify the intent of this
rule

00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
of this law and how it how it somehow
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
can be manipulated so that data can be
 
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.870 align:start position:0%
can be manipulated so that data can be
shared

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
currently uh and i would suspect there
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
may be others that will testify
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
more in depth to this but currently
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of this legislation is
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
enable hospitals and doctors
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
to incorporate this data into their
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
electronic health records of individual
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
patients that they're seeing
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
all right uh there's also a financial
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh matter that we are eligible for
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
additional federal funding for medicaid
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh by enabling by enacting this
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
legislation uh for the purposes of pdmp
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh the data there's a study done in 19
 
00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry in 2018
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
by the new england journal of medicine
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
that conclusively showed that the
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh the use of this pdnp
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
um facility
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
when combined with uh expedited
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
clinical access provides better outcomes
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
all the way around um and so
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
again we are protecting the patient's
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
privacy we are enabling the patient's
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
providers uh the doctors and and aprns
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
and ils professionals to
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
access this data electronically um
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
automatically but still with the
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
protections that are both hipaa provided
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
by the provider the doctor in the office
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
so and also
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
holding responsible anyone that has
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.389 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
weber

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
weber
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'm this is really rather a process
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
question and it's perhaps
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
is better reserved for our executive
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
session but i
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
do you join me in thinking that it is
 
00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
really better to keep policy matters
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
that do not
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
have a financial implication
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
out of the budget and the trailer bill
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
rather than enacting
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
rather than sliding them into the budget
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
or the trailer bill um
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
because they are policy and not having
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and one
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
which i deal with on senate finance
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
starting yesterday i would again i would
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
be amenable to whatever gets the job
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
done this is not a financial implication
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
but the the medical profession the
 
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.150 align:start position:0%
but the the medical profession the
hospitals

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh the pharmacies are all looking for
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
this ability
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh to uh electronically access
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
um uh with with
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
significantly less work by the accessor
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
there was a concerted effort to access
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
the database
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
um and every access provi takes a
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
physical action
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
this would provide electronics uh i i
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
don't have a concern
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
as to putting it in trailer bill
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
or putting it as separate legislation
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
my concern is getting the getting the
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
job done so that these folks can
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
can use that pdmp to better uh treat
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
identify and treat uh patients who are
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
substance misusing well i understand the
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
the urgency of the concern and thank you
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
very much for the question for the
 
00:16:48.839 --> 00:16:52.550 align:start position:0%
very much for the question for the
answer

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think
 
00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:00.069 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think
representative

00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
woods has had his hands up for quite a
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
i am wondering
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
if in the process of incorporating
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
results into patient records if there's
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
explicit consent but from the patient
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
that was discussed and in fact there's
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
notification provided
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's no notification currently given
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
when they access it now
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
and in fact if i'm not mistaken it's
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
required that medical professionals do
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps one of the medical doctors on
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
the on the committee might better
 
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:52.230 align:start position:0%
clarify that um
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.230 align:start position:0%
clarify that um
[Music]

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
but i i again it's not produced now as
 
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.270 align:start position:0%
but i i again it's not produced now as
as

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
you know did you are you aware of the
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
fact that we're curing this this is uh
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's a policy that's in place as we
 
00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.350 align:start position:0%
it's a policy that's in place as we
speak

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i might the data is
 
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.510 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i might the data is
then

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
used anyway by the medical professionals
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
i don't see that as a concern at this
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative woods uh thank you mr
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
a quick question first to you are you
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
looking for my
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
visual hand or the raised hand uh
 
00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:29.110 align:start position:0%
visual hand or the raised hand uh
electronically

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for representative marsha's
 
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.230 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for representative marsha's
queue

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you senator for taking my
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
first of all uh uh having been a
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgeon for many years uh
 
00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:46.070 align:start position:0%
orthopedic surgeon for many years uh
this

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh process uh were fully in place when i
 
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:49.669 align:start position:0%
uh process uh were fully in place when i
was

00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
actually taking trauma call uh would
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
a great assist for me
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
getting phone calls for prescriptions on
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
the weekend
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
my question uh is i have a little bit of
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
concern because
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps because i don't understand the
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
difference between the front end
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
and the back end of this process the
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
front end being
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
on page 1 line 26
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
through 28 the electronic health record
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
keeping system owner or license holder
 
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
shall be responsible for ensuring that
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
only authorized individuals
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
have access to the program information
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that's uh individuals in uh
 
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:31.669 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that's uh individuals in uh
say

00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
if i were in my office uh or in the
 
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.909 align:start position:0%
if i were in my office uh or in the
hospital

00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
um so on the back end uh the pdpm
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
um how do they know that that's a
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
designated individual
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
does each individual on the front end
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
have a code
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
that has to be um designated to that
 
00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.110 align:start position:0%
that has to be um designated to that
individual

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
and then registered on the back end uh
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
with a uh pdpm uh
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
how is that because uh otherwise an
 
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.630 align:start position:0%
how is that because uh otherwise an
individual

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
in my office may say oh well uh aunt
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
susie uh just
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
um i went to the hall i wonder what
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
medication she's on
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then tickle that in through the
 
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.510 align:start position:0%
and then tickle that in through the
office

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
into the pdpm so is there a
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
how does that functionally work from the
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
front end to the back end
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
the only access uh
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
only people that are registered by the
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
office that's using the pdmp system
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
are authorized to access that data
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
so they're specifically named yeah
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
they're specifically named does the pdpm
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that i don't
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
dr strength for the department is on the
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
call and signed up to testify he may be
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question later
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
well he could answer that now if he
 
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.029 align:start position:0%
well he could answer that now if he
wishes

00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
wishes
 
00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:10.230 align:start position:0%
to call on him yes
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:14.149 align:start position:0%
to call on him yes
[Music]

00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
dr um this
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
is initially for the purpose of
 
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
is initially for the purpose of
answering

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
answering
 
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
um representative dr wood's question if
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes so
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that question
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
so right now in order to access data
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
through the pdmp
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
one has to be registered and
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
given login data which typically
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
consists of an email address
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
and a password that's how i access the
 
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.070 align:start position:0%
and a password that's how i access the
program

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
as an emergency physician if i were in
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
an office based practice
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
we likely would have other office staff
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
such as a nurse
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
or a clerical staff who would
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
sort of be teeing up the patients uh for
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
the day's visits and they can access
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
the data to have that information
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
available when i go in to see the
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
patient but they must be
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
registered under the name of a surrogate
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
me for example
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
and they are given individual specific
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
access data so when they go into
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
up the day's patients an electronic
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
footprint is left
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
so that the program managers can
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
actually go in and see who
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
accessed that data that would
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
specifically prevent
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
me for example if i were snooping and
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
looking to see
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
what you might have had prescribed or
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
the governor would have prescribed
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
if i were foolish enough to do that it
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
would leave an electronic footprint
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
and if that information were
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
inappropriately disclosed
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
it could it could easily be determined
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
who had uh done that
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
illegally uh thank you dr strang
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
i know that was the case for general
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if it had carried over uh
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
further questions for senator geider
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
and representative merchant is this for
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
senator guyton
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking my question
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
it actually goes to senator probably
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
david dr strang
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
in regards to the database i understand
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
that the patient can have
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
access to find out who's been accessing
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
their data within the database within
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
within the program itself so there are
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
footprints within a database that a
 
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
footprints within a database that a
patient

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
can ascertain and find out
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
once that data leaves that database how
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
does a patient then
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
access inside of a healthcare entity
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
who has had access to their prescription
 
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.390 align:start position:0%
who has had access to their prescription
information

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
because no longer is going to be within
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
the confines of the
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
prescription drug program database now
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
it's into another database
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
how does the patient know that someone's
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
been tampering with
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
looking and snooping into their records
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
over there regards to their controlled
 
00:24:09.679 --> 00:24:12.149 align:start position:0%
over there regards to their controlled
drugs

00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i not sorry agree that it goes
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
into another database it goes into an
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
electronic health record
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
the access to which i'm sure is
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
controlled by the physician
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
the office perhaps the office manager so
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
i think that you know the disclosure of
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
that data
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
is going to require access to it and
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up thank you senator
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
gutter for the
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
for the answer um since it's leaving one
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
database is going to health record which
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
is really another database
 
00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.909 align:start position:0%
is really another database
electronically

00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
would it be wise to have the patient
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
have sort of written consent
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
because then we're moving physically the
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
data from one database to another
 
00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.789 align:start position:0%
data from one database to another
database

00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
database
 
00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
so the patient's aware the fact that
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
it's leaving the confines of one
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
program and going into another
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
electronic health record that they are
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
i i i believe that
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with that but
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
again i would think the medical
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
professionals might uh
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
might weigh in on on the effect that
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
potential chilling effect uh of
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
discovering a person that is misusing
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
um and so the notice is notice is given
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
in the doctor's offices that's a
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
requirement of the statute
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh that you're that your pdmp
 
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
you're being researched on the pdmp
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
basically uh but if you were to require
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
people that are abusing
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
to consent in writing to discovery of
 
00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:43.269 align:start position:0%
to consent in writing to discovery of
their

00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical history if you will
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a significant
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on the very purpose for
 
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.149 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on the very purpose for
this

00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
for this program i know that we had
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
discussions about that
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
and again at some point we have to trust
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
that the doctor's offices and hospitals
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
again everyone that accesses that data
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
is by name identified
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
anytime they access it so again it's
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
easy to trace
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
certainly to an office in which case a
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
liability could be
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for giving me
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
permission thank you for taking my
 
00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:34.630 align:start position:0%
permission thank you for taking my
question

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure who's wants to answer this
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we do have a system of
 
00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.669 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we do have a system of
protection

00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
so that there's a record of who accesses
 
00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:47.510 align:start position:0%
so that there's a record of who accesses
information

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
and now i just like to get down to the
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
fine point of
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
does the person in the office the
 
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.789 align:start position:0%
does the person in the office the
doctor's

00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
doctor's
 
00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
office have a different id
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
from the doctor himself or not doctor
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
whoever the practitioner is
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
um so is you know that's a
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
great comfort to me that there is a
 
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.669 align:start position:0%
great comfort to me that there is a
record

00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
but like you're saying somebody might
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
want to know
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
how aunt susie was doing uh
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
so does it say the person who accesses
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know the office staff
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
or does it just say the
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
office thank you for the question
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh each person that's granted i want to
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
say the term is licensee but i'm not
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
sure that's the right term but each
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
person that's
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
granted access is individually
 
00:27:41.669 --> 00:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
identified with their own
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
unique password so it's specific to
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
who access the database for what patient
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
at what time and
 
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so that that means
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
that the person the staff person in the
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
office has their own identity
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
 
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:10.549 align:start position:0%
representative cushman thank you mr
chairman

00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
i i was wondering so is this for all
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
medications or only controlled
 
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.350 align:start position:0%
medications or only controlled
substances

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
substances
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not all medications it's it's
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
controlled substances i think schedule
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
two through four i think is the
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate terminology
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh narcotics yeah yeah follow up
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
um can you clarify the limits that will
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
be placed on
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
access to this
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
and are there any other government
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
entities that could access this
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
currently there there is no access by
 
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.830 align:start position:0%
currently there there is no access by
dhhs

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
i chaired a working group here i'm going
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
to say two maybe three summers ago
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
in which we got all the stakeholders
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
together and we started working
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know towards a massive change to
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
provide massive access to a dhhs and it
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
just got to be too cumbersome so we've
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
broken it into bite-sized chunks if you
 
00:29:05.279 --> 00:29:06.230 align:start position:0%
broken it into bite-sized chunks if you
will

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
right now the hhs cannot access that
 
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.950 align:start position:0%
right now the hhs cannot access that
data

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
and again that'll be the subject of
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
separate legislation that we've very
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
carefully scrutinized because again
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
this was never intended to be used as a
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
database for public health
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh um uh analysis of populations
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
it was intended as an individual um you
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
know assist to individuals
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
by individual doctors or individual uh
 
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
medical professionals
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh that transition or that expansion is
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
one we have to watch with great care
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
again given the mandate for privacy that
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
was the initial legislation that
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
established pdmp the concerns for
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining that privacy and of course
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
one more representative gay we don't
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
want to keep you from the fun of working
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
on the budget
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
oh do please yes
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you should i ask a really long
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
question no
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
no okay um okay it sounds like
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we have we are building in all
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
these protections thank goodness
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
but we are still going to access some of
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
this information
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
to benefit from federal money
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
do i understand that correctly no
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
the the benefit the federal money would
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
be an ancillary benefit
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
it's not we're not doing this for that
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
purpose doing this to enable the medical
 
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.710 align:start position:0%
purpose doing this to enable the medical
professionals

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
to streamline uh safely uh
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
their functionality in their offices and
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
in the hospitals
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh emergency rooms or whatever and so
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
it would be an ancillary benefit it's
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
not required this program is fully
 
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.269 align:start position:0%
not required this program is fully
funded

00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh under the state budget so uh you know
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
go after medicaid funds for medicaid
 
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:02.149 align:start position:0%
go after medicaid funds for medicaid
people

00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh for the four uh folks that treat them
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's a possibility it's certainly not
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative weber working on finding
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
the unmute button sir
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
um i believe representative cushman had
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
oh i got my phone she got her follow-up
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um i i just wanted to be sure
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
to to clarify is it not
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
the overarching purpose
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
of this entire legislation
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
that we want to ensure
 
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
that controlled substances are not being
 
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.430 align:start position:0%
that controlled substances are not being
misused

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
misused
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the legislation that
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
we have before us
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
now that was the existing legislation
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
and that the purpose
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
of the legislation that we have before
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
and now
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
is to streamline the process for
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
professionals who were having to make
 
00:32:14.159 --> 00:32:17.190 align:start position:0%
professionals who were having to make
really

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
lengthy and uh cumbersome inquiry
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we are hoping to get ourselves to a
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
point of of somewhat more streamlined
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
questioning of the database is that
 
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
questioning of the database is that
correct

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
that is a good assessment representative
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%

your presentation of anything you wish

to tell us
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much good morning mr
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
my name is dr david strang i am an
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
emergency physician and chairman of the
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
advisory council for the state's
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
pdmp the program to which this bill
 
00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:33.990 align:start position:0%
pdmp the program to which this bill
applies

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
applies
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
i want to be clear though that the
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
council has not met since this bill was
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
modified to its latest version so i am
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
not here to relate a formal
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the advisory council
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
on sb45 that being said though in prior
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
meetings there was clear support from
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
the council members for the concept
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
of integration between the pdmp and
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
electronic health records
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
also known as ehrs in my professional
 
00:33:59.440 --> 00:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
also known as ehrs in my professional
opinion

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
this integration is the most important
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
part of this bill
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
currently in order to access pdmp data
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
for a patient that i'm treating in the
 
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:08.710 align:start position:0%
for a patient that i'm treating in the
er

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
er
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
i have to leave the ehr go to the
 
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.629 align:start position:0%
i have to leave the ehr go to the
desktop

00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
desktop
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
click on a web browser such as google
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
type in new hampshire prescription drug
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
monitoring program
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
hope that the search brings up the login
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
page for the pdmp
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
if not i have to navigate to the login
 
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.750 align:start position:0%
if not i have to navigate to the login
page

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
type in my email address and my password
 
00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:29.270 align:start position:0%
type in my email address and my password
which

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
i remember because i use the program
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
enough but others
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
might not then i have to navigate to the
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
patient information page by now i've
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
forgotten the patient's name and date of
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
birth which is the minimum
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
data that you have to put in so i have
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
to put that information
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
in and then and only then can i access
 
00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:49.909 align:start position:0%
in and then and only then can i access
data

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
for that patient i think you can
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
understand that's a lengthy process that
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
might deter
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
many from using the program this bill
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
integration such that all i would have
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
to do while
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the ehr for a specific patient is to
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
click the pdmp link
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the ehr would automatically connect
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
me to the pdmp for that patient
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
and that patient only this bill would
 
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
and that patient only this bill would
streamline

00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
streamline
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
the process tremendously resulting in
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
greater usage of the program
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
and adding greater safety to the process
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
of controlled substance prescribing
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
after all that's what this program is
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
all about this bill doesn't allow
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
greater access
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
in fact some of the other housekeeping
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
language such as in lines 14 through 16
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
actually closes loopholes that might
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
allow inappropriate access from retired
 
00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:41.109 align:start position:0%
allow inappropriate access from retired
practitioners

00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i thank you for your consideration
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%

senate bill 45
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
and we i am specifically testifying on
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
um actually paragraphs two and three
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
which um represent senator gaida
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
um and dr strang have um
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
been very clear in explaining that um
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
so but i want to just thank senator
 
00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.550 align:start position:0%
so but i want to just thank senator
gaida

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
gaida
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
he did sponsor a very similar piece of
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
legislation senate bill
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
676 last year but unfortunately due to
 
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:12.870 align:start position:0%
676 last year but unfortunately due to
the

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic impacting the legislative
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
process it did not move forward
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
as dr strang has indicated
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
this program what we really are trying
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
to do is just to
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
create that interface and it's the emr
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
pdmp in
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
interface that's really what this
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
legislation does it is not
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
changing as dr strang said the program
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
the underlying program which has been in
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
effect for years um and is a very
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
important tool for practitioners but we
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
are just trying to
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
to eliminate actually the manual process
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
that dr strang
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
explained and is really problematic
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
because it adds a lot of complexity and
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
unnecessary administrative burden and
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
this is actually a much
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
better um way to to ensure
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
that the data is getting into the
 
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.230 align:start position:0%
that the data is getting into the
individual's

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
individual's
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
emr um electronic medical record
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
so that's really what that does and as
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
doc senator
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
gaida explained we did have a lot of
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
discussion when this
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
original bill was introduced a couple
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
time time passes quickly but i think it
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
was actually when we had that discussion
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
it was either the summer of 18 or the
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
summer of 19
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
when we had that stakeholder group and
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
protecting the patients making sure that
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
they understand
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
the data and making sure obviously that
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
they have hipaa projections which of
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
course they do
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
so we added paragraph three
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
to ensure that there is the
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality component
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
um that was raised by some of the
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
senators um
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
prior to um this getting um
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
not getting through last year so that's
 
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.190 align:start position:0%
not getting through last year so that's
really

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
my testimony i have submitted some
 
00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:00.390 align:start position:0%
my testimony i have submitted some
testimony

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony that you i believe
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
have hap
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions i
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
understand representative marsha's point
 
00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the budget and again i will
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
reiterate what
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
senator guida said this is very
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
important legislation
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
we really need this to um to pass
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
but we will um what however
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
the best process for getting it into
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
statute is
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
if it needs to go through the budget
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
process um if
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
because of the change in the statute if
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
the budget passes and the program does
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
move over to dhhs
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
i understand a different statute
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
potentially would need to be
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
modified so whatever i i um
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
trust that we will um follow that
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
process we just need to um we really are
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
asking that this
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
this process be actually turned put into
 
00:39:55.119 --> 00:39:55.670 align:start position:0%
this process be actually turned put into
the

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
statue so thank you so much thank you
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much for your
 
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.150 align:start position:0%

testimony

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
testimony

thank you i have no one else on the list
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
all right mr courtney
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
all right i apologize um good morning mr
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee my
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
name is lindsay corny i'm the executive
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
director of the office of professional
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
i apologize i wasn't able to register on
 
00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.349 align:start position:0%
i apologize i wasn't able to register on
time

00:40:57.349 --> 00:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
but oplc is the agency that administers
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
the pdmp and so i wanted to offer my
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and be available to
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
if you have them as as previously
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
discussed at length section 2 would
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
permit the office to integrate the pdmp
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
with electronic health systems across
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
as dr strang mentioned one of the most
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
cited barriers to use of the pdmp
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
by practitioners is that it interrupts
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
workflow practitioners must step present
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
leave the ehr to query a separate portal
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
which obviously takes additional time
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
and it's been cited as a reason for for
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
non-use of the pdnp
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
by integrating the new hampshire pd p
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
with ehr systems as other states have
 
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.030 align:start position:0%
with ehr systems as other states have
done

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
across the country new hampshire would
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
promote the use of pdmp by practitioners
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
and dispensers by eliminating this
 
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.309 align:start position:0%
and dispensers by eliminating this
barrier

00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
barrier
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
and providing ease of access within an
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
established workflow
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
um so obviously given the public health
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
crisis currently impacting our state
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
which is the opioid epidemic that
 
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.309 align:start position:0%
which is the opioid epidemic that
remains

00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
remains
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
oplc supports this legislation and
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
requests your support as well
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's all i have for comments but i'm
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if you
 
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:05.910 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if you
have

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
if you have any regarding the program or
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
good morning and the meeting welcomes
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative kendall snow to the lobby
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no more questions and
 
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no more questions and
uh

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
i am now going to close the hearing on
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh 45 senate bill 45 and
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
time representative marsha you had made
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
a suggestion about the possibility
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
of retaining it um my concern mr
 
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.829 align:start position:0%
of retaining it um my concern mr
chairman

00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
is uh if he passed this bill and it's
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
immediately repealed
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
by her provisions for the budget
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
accomplished really very much um
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
if we retain the bill um then
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
or something needs to be fixed we would
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
immediately have this kind of hand as a
 
00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.309 align:start position:0%
immediately have this kind of hand as a
vehicle

00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
to then put it into whichever statute
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
the pdmp
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
ends up in the fall of the budget still
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
so and that would happen much faster
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
than it would happen if we could
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
introduce a new build next fall
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
so i i think the best thing as far as
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
getting this in place
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
the fastest would be for us to retain
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
i'm confused by the logic
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative marsh so i'm just trying
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
to untangle
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
procedure here um it seems to me
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
that if we decide this is a good bill
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
and i certainly
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
think it is and we pass it
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is adopting a committee
 
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.309 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is adopting a committee
recommendation

00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
nothing happens with the committee
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation until the next time the
 
00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:30.950 align:start position:0%
recommendation until the next time the
house

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
meets at which point which i'm told
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be until for quite some
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
time the budget
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any effect on this
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
legislation whatsoever
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
until the governor actually signs the
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
budget into law
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that there is
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
no reason why we could not pass
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
this um recommend this as ought to pass
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh send that to the house
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
as our recommendation so that
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
it is very clear what our position as a
 
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.270 align:start position:0%
it is very clear what our position as a
committee

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
is on the legislation if if
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
if that is the committee's uh position
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
i'm making
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
assumptions and then at that time we can
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
either table it in the house if if
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
we know that it it has arrived at a
 
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
destination that's
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
agreeable to everybody or we can pass
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh knowing that there will have to be
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
committees of conference and other sorts
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
of things
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
um or or that it could simply be held
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
either by the president of the senate or
 
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.470 align:start position:0%
either by the president of the senate or
the

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house until such time as
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
resolved and we would have it in reserve
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm wondering if it doesn't make
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
more sense to
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
pass it if that's the will of the
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
committee on on the action on the bill
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
and then allow further steps later on in
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
the process and i would
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
if if i have lost sight of the ball
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere i would
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
is representative it currently part of
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
part b of the budget the answer yeah
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
yes section 39 of the budget with repeal
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
rsa to 30 games
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
which is precisely what this bill is
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my really genuine
 
00:47:01.839 --> 00:47:03.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my really genuine
question

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
if we pass it does that mean if we pass
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
it here
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
right give our recommendation does that
 
00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
right give our recommendation does that
give

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
leadership the choice of letting it be a
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
stand-alone bill
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
which at this point would feel really
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
good to know it's standalone because i
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
don't see how anybody
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
could be against it and the fact that it
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
somehow got in the budget would be
 
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.549 align:start position:0%
somehow got in the budget would be
irrelevant

00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
irrelevant
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
if we pass it the language in the budget
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
can we supersede it if we
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
if we pass the bill separately
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
i mean we have to recommend it
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then it can get voted on it can get
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
if it passes by itself
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
would that automatically affect the
 
00:47:57.119 --> 00:47:57.829 align:start position:0%
would that automatically affect the
budget

00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
no because it's different
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
to a difference that it's moved from rsa
 
00:48:05.319 --> 00:48:06.630 align:start position:0%
to a difference that it's moved from rsa
rsa318b

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
rsa318b
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
to rsa 126 a so whatever amendments we
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
make that rsa 318b
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
go away when that section of law is
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
appealed and it reverts to the section
 
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
that ben's put in place in a
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
126k representative whoever is perfectly
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
correct we could
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
pass the bill in table but then if
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
further changes have to be made from
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
fall one of us would have to file
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
another bill to make those changes
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
whereas if we retain it we have a
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
vehicle then
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
we can then immediately make whatever
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
changes are needed if no changes are
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
needed then we can say it's unnecessary
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
so it's really a procedure
 
00:48:46.839 --> 00:48:50.950 align:start position:0%
so it's really a procedure
representative

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
that that was the clarification that i
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
was looking for
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
um i you know and i i want to clarify in
 
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.270 align:start position:0%
um i you know and i i want to clarify in
turn

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
if if we as a house and senate pass two
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
um conflicting bills the the deciding
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
factor is which one
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
is signed most recently by the governor
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
so but what i had not
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
really fully grasped was representative
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
marsha's point
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
about having a vehicle available
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
not so much the conflicts with the
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
budget but having a vehicle
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
available should a quick fix be needed
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
because this
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
would carry with it the possibility
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
if not the reality that we could get it
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
done quicker than
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
if it required a whole new bill so
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
his his point is well taken in that
 
00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:52.230 align:start position:0%
his his point is well taken in that
respect

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative folsom thank you mr
 
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.829 align:start position:0%
yes representative folsom thank you mr
chair

00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:49:56.839 --> 00:49:59.910 align:start position:0%
chair
um

00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
if we uh retain it
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
is it possible for us as a committee
 
00:50:11.349 --> 00:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
to not take an official vote but more of
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
a stronghold
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
highly recommend i highly recommend yes
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
but not officially recommend
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
so that leadership knows what our intent
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
is with what's in retaining or is that
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
just something
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
that can be verbally shared
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
with them i would think it would be
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
better verbally shared i'm not sure
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative weber can help me but i'm
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
not sure that we
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
actually have a device to do that
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
well if i may mr chairman
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
there there's nothing to stop the chair
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
asking for a straw poll on anything it
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
have any effect on anything
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
and certainly anybody from the committee
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
is uh welcome to convey their
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
their you know thoughts and and
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
and on any of our proceedings to anybody
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
so there's no problem with conveying it
 
00:51:18.559 --> 00:51:19.510 align:start position:0%
so there's no problem with conveying it
verbally

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
verbally
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
and there is no problem certainly with
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
taking a straw poll if the chair
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
desires to do so but it doesn't have any
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
effect other than we know what we did
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
and and the clerk will have a and the
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
clerk will certainly have a record of it
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
anybody like that idea of a straw poll i
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
like stroke balls
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
struggles fine
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
then let us take a straw poll which is
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
not an official vote
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to know how many people um
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
are affirming this in the straw poll and
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
the straw poll
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
is that we like this bill as it was
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
presented to us
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
and in some manner or other depending on
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
what happens to
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
rsa 318 and so on we would like this to
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
go forward so
 
00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:17.839 align:start position:0%
i guess the straw fall is we like the
 
00:52:17.839 --> 00:52:20.470 align:start position:0%
i guess the straw fall is we like the
build

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
informally without writing it down but
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
using your names
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
i would like to have that
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
role called so i can when i write a
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
letter um
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
say that so many people affirmed this
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
in an unofficial struggle and so many
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
so would the clerk call the role on the
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
straw poll that we
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
affirm 45.
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you it's not a vote i
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
mean it is a vote but it's not an
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
official vote it came in late
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
so far i haven't heard it assumed that
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%

00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%

representative

00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i have two i have one point and one
 
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:53.910 align:start position:0%
i i have two i have one point and one
question

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
um i am while i
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
understand representative
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
marsh's thoughts on
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
having a vehicle available
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that this
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
committee is surrendering a great deal
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
of its authority if we do
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
not choose to either pass or itl
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
this bill because
 
00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
we are then at the mercy of what happens
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
and we there have been times when
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
budgets have not
 
00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
passed at all and if that is true then
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to happen here either
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh so that's the concern i have with the
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
proposed process i
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
i really think that this term
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
the policy committees have surrendered a
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
great deal of their authority to the
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
budget process
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i do not think that that is good
 
00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:58.150 align:start position:0%
and i do not think that that is good
policy

00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
either now or in the future uh i
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
understand that covid makes things much
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
more difficult but i think it's a bad
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
precedent to start
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that we have not
 
00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:18.390 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that we have not
heard

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh my second my second point is that we
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
have not heard from representative
 
00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.829 align:start position:0%
have not heard from representative
merchants

00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
merchants
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
about his opposition to this bill but
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
given that he is
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
intimately involved in working with the
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
pdmp in one way or another
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
i would very much want to hear his
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts and
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
others we took a straw poll without
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
hearing that
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
and my opinion might change based on
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
what i hear from other members of the
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
i want people to bear that firmly in
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
mind because
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
my my vote may change we have not yet
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
had a discussion
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
and again that is a further erosion of
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
the the committee process of discussion
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
before votes so i'm going to bump
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
representative merchant to the top of my
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
list of those wishing to speak so he can
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
speak to that very point i was
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
going down the same line of thinking um
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
madame ranking member thank you
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i think the
 
00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.670 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i think the
bill

00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
the intent of it is something i can
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
support the way that bill's written i
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
could not
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
and my rationale to that is if you go
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
back into line
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
three and four where it says dispenser
 
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.190 align:start position:0%
three and four where it says dispenser
with

00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
medication reconciliation that is not
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
always done by the dispenser sometimes
 
00:58:38.309 --> 00:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
it's done by the prescriber
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
so therefore i think the prescriber
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
should have the same language in there
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
as well as the dispenser because
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's times in which a physician will
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
do med reconciliation not just the
 
00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.950 align:start position:0%
do med reconciliation not just the
pharmacist

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacist
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
and in that capacity the position is not
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
a dispenser they're actually a
 
00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.510 align:start position:0%
a dispenser they're actually a
prescriber

00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
prescriber
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
number two when you get down to line 14
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
a practitioner who neither prescribes or
 
00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.589 align:start position:0%
a practitioner who neither prescribes or
dispenses

00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
dispenses
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
who's not actively working as a
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacist with the new hampshire
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
licensed pharmacy
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
or a new hampshire healthcare facility
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
that does not
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
talk about a practitioner being a
 
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.549 align:start position:0%
talk about a practitioner being a
physician

00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
physician
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
um because in that point in time looking
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
at somebody
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
who works in it but the thing is if you
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
don't work inside of the facility
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
if you're a physician and prescribing
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
from your home you're exempt from this
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't include the fact that
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
you're licensed by the state
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
it talks about where you're performing
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
the activity not the fact that you have
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
access to the database
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
when you're retired so if you're retired
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
as a pharmacist or a physician
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
you can still have access to the
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
database which we're trying to minimize
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
and to eliminate and if you put the fact
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
that they have to be in a
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
physical facility not by the licensure
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
that becomes a problematic
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
number three when you look at number 23
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
lying about the query and retrieval of
 
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
the database
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's not patient specific so my concern
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
is that the way it's written
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
a program can be written in such a way
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's querying the whole database
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
and pulling back and retrieval not
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
something is patient specific
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
but pulling back a lot of the database
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
that's not really connected to a
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
particular patient
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
number four i think the patient should
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
be aware of the fact that you're taking
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
data from one database
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
and putting into another database
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
because they have access to the database
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
that they want
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
to in the prescription drug monitoring
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
program to see whose footprints are all
 
01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:17.829 align:start position:0%
program to see whose footprints are all
over

01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
their data when it goes an electronic
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
medical record inside of a hospital
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
they they don't have access that way you
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
have to go through another process to
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
get access to it
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i don't support the
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
bill the way it's written i could
 
01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cushman
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
i put my hand down uh representative
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
weber asked my question thank you
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative acton uh
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
i i have to concur with um
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative weber about this i'm very
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
worried that
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
by retaining it's it's going to get
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
thrown into a budget process that we
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
have no
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
control over at this point and it's not
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
looking good as far as the
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
the budget fight that and so a lot of
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
this may wind up on the negotiating room
 
01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.589 align:start position:0%
this may wind up on the negotiating room
floor

01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that the the need has
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
been demonstrated by
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
practitioners this is a source of
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
trouble for them
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh that need is now so retaining is just
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
another way to kind of put it off uh we
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
need more of a sense of urgency i
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
believe and whatever it takes to get
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
this done
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
this this this session now is is what
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
i'll support
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
gay thank you after listening to all of
 
01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:42.710 align:start position:0%
gay thank you after listening to all of
y'all

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
y'all
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
come up with ideas about how to tighten
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
i would really prefer that that those
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
be submitted in an amendment
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
because you know right now we're not
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
59 bills to look at it seems like it
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
would be worth
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
doing it correctly and making it into a
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
separate bill
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
not the budgets can come and go
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
line items can come and go i also like
 
01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.789 align:start position:0%
line items can come and go i also like
lucy

01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
lucy
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
pardon me representative would like to
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
see this as a standalone
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill as it was submitted and support
 
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.309 align:start position:0%
bill as it was submitted and support
that

01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do with the budget
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
they can do but
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
that's fluid i'd like this to stand
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
so but with the corrections in it
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
because we certainly don't want to
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
break the intent by leaving out some
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
the chair calls on himself and um
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'm one i've been wondering and i think
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative merchant's
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
concerns bumped me a little forward
 
01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
if language were put in through an
 
01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.109 align:start position:0%
if language were put in through an
amendment

01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
that underlined five
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
and wherever the number 318 appears
 
01:03:03.359 --> 01:03:04.150 align:start position:0%
and wherever the number 318 appears
again

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
if we set a licensed hospital pharmacy
 
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:07.190 align:start position:0%
if we set a licensed hospital pharmacy
under

01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
rsa 318 or
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
should 318 be abolished
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
126 a 89 that way
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
the bill comes out meaning wherever you
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
folks put this stuff
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
this is where we want this to go
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
i mean that may be too simple to be
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
good but that's what i thought and then
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
we could on the quick um representative
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
merchant and
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
others who may be sharing your concern
 
01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:41.589 align:start position:0%
others who may be sharing your concern
uh

01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
offer that as part of the amendment or
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
there could be two committee amendments
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
and we will come back at some point
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
fairly soon
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
and uh address this uh how does that
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
sound to the crowd
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i was put my hand up to
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
to very much second the comments of
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative gay but i will second
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
yours as well
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh we've got plenty of time and we have
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
two bills so far so there is
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
enough time for representative merchant
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
to draft
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
um an amendment with his concerns
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
in it so that we can all take a good
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
look at it and the other thing just for
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
for members of the committee to know is
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
that you're absolutely correct
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
drafting staff in ols has a great
 
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
alternatives in their legislation and i
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
have sometimes seen them get
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
quite involved and this one doesn't need
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
to be that involved
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
but in the event that this other bill
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
passes this happens and in the event
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
other bill fails that happens so i
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
i think there is room for that to happen
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
as as part of a reconciliation
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
process but also right there in the bill
 
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.710 align:start position:0%
process but also right there in the bill
and

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
i certainly would be much happier uh
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
waiting to see what representative
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
merchant and
 
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
others who might want to speak to him
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
because i think the points that he makes
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
are very valid and i would like to see
 
01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:23.349 align:start position:0%
are very valid and i would like to see
them

01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
examined and incorporated if if that's
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
the will of the committee
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh representative webber let me
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
come back to you on that and do you
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
think it would be wise for the
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh my concern about language saying 318
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
or wherever phpv
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
lands be in his amendment as well or
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
another amendment that i would craft i
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
think that would be a subject
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
for the people drafting to discuss with
 
01:05:51.119 --> 01:05:52.549 align:start position:0%
for the people drafting to discuss with
ols

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
ols
 
01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
because they have more experience in
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
doing that than i and i generally leave
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
those men

amendment
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%

thank you by the way mr chair uh
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
i i just want to go quickly back to what
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
what senator guy mentioned about
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
um at some point we need to put reliance
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
upon the the belief that the the
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
practitioners are going to do the right
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
thing i think
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
too many times when when we're in
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
government we may be jaded because we
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
happen to see a lot of
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
problems and so forth that we we tend to
 
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.190 align:start position:0%
problems and so forth that we we tend to
start

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
persevering too much on the wrong doers
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
and we forget that the vast vast
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
people who do the right thing or want to
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
wind up getting it inconvenienced
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
because we're building in so many
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
regulations and rules to go after
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
that tiny percentage that may want to
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this so i just wanted
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
to call attention to that and
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
and just remind people of that thank you
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay with that
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
totally blanked the term um exec session
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
and now i open the hearing on senate
 
01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:01.269 align:start position:0%
and now i open the hearing on senate

and human services i always feel like
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'm coming home when i'm
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
in front of that's because you've been
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
here before yes i have
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%

01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
11 towns on the seacoast
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i am introducing sb 120.
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that was requested by
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
physician assistants
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
and i believe uh linda martino is here
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
to testify and she can speak
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
in more detail to this i did want to
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
um basically outline
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
the rationale behind this and that's
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
that in
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
the statute which is 328 d2a
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
there was not the clear provision
 
01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire physician assistants
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
in other words physician assistants
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
licensed in new hampshire
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
can work under physicians
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
from elsewhere who are at and employed
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
by the va
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
in manchester or the va the veterans
 
01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:45.590 align:start position:0%
in manchester or the va the veterans
administration

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
medical center so that was the point of
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
was to make it possible for physician
 
01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.189 align:start position:0%
was to make it possible for physician
assistants

01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
assistants
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
to practice at the
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
va under you know pas have to work
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh under the supervision of a
 
01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.270 align:start position:0%
uh uh under the supervision of a
physician

01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
physician
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
but as we all know many of the or
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
that the truth is that there are many uh
 
01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.390 align:start position:0%
that the truth is that there are many uh
physicians

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
at the va who are not credentialed
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so that was the point
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
was to allow new hampshire physician
 
01:11:22.229 --> 01:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
assistants to work
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
under those physicians there has been
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
some confusion
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
because the original bill the statute
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
it says new hampshire well line 78 says
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
state licensure laws rules and
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
regulations for physician assistance
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
are hereby suspended for those physician
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
assistants from other states or
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
countries who are employed
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
and then it keeps going uh in the that's
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
pretty that's current existing statute
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the bill as introduced
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh i had inadvertently struck out
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
war countries uh and
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
um when it was coming to the floor of
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
the senate after having been approved
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
with you know by the committee with
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
the pas and va uh
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
recognized that that should not have
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
been stricken
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
because it actually is pre-existing
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
statute and i've gotten a couple of
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
emails from members of the commission
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee from your committee on this i
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
just wanted to tell you
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
where this came from so the floor
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
amendment reinstated the original
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
i don't have a strong opinion on whether
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
that was that's appropriate but what we
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
did was
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
just re reestablish the current statute
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
so with that i am happy to answer any
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
questions i
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
can on the bill and
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
and i believe linda is here and she can
 
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.590 align:start position:0%
and i believe linda is here and she can
speak

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
specifically to the pa role at
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
the va i guess that makes them
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
vapas but anyway um it's okay with me
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a question
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
um i know there are similarities and
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
differences between pas and nurse
 
01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:27.270 align:start position:0%
differences between pas and nurse
practitioners

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
i employ two nurse practitioners no
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
physicians assistants
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
but my eye doctor employs two pas and no
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners so right in our
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
conversation we
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
compare and contrast uh would
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
you be amenable
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
to adding nurse practitioners
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
to physician assistants
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
technically in new hampshire that would
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
not be necessary because nurse
 
01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.590 align:start position:0%
not be necessary because nurse
practitioners

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
are allowed to practice independently
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay pas are not
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
so uh it's not an
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
intentional well it is an intentional
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
exclusion because they don't need this
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners in new hampshire
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
have the right to practice independently
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
and do not have to be under the
 
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.270 align:start position:0%
and do not have to be under the
supervision

01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
of a physician which is one of the you
 
01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
know they have different training
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
and i would be clobbered by my favorite
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners if i said they're
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
so i won't say that and
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
also by my favorite pas they are they
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
have different
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
scopes of practice they have different
 
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:39.510 align:start position:0%
scopes of practice they have different
roles

01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
roles
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
as patients we see them you know
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
doing sort of the same things in many
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
cases but
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
actually unless you have a physician
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
in your practice mr chair you would not
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
be able to have a pa
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
practicing because they have to be they
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
have to have an identified
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
physician supervisor so i have a pa who
 
01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.070 align:start position:0%
physician supervisor so i have a pa who
works

01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
works
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
under me as and i'm her identified
 
01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.709 align:start position:0%
under me as and i'm her identified
supervisor

01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
supervisor
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
but my nurse practitioner does not need
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
any of that she is
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
independent can practice on her own uh
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
and she's overseen by the board of
 
01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:17.830 align:start position:0%
and she's overseen by the board of
nursing

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for reminding me of that my
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
second question to you
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
is i see an amendment uh
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
put by representatives canaric and marsh
 
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.070 align:start position:0%
put by representatives canaric and marsh
represent

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
amendment 1107 h
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the difference is
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
in line 15 of the
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill the word or countries is struck
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's not in the amendment and in line 20
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing however if you go up into
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
line eight
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
in the amendment or country still
 
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.229 align:start position:0%
in the amendment or country still
appears

01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
appears
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
so um either that
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
is for a reason that i can't figure out
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
or they got two-thirds of the references
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
to um countries oh
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
so the the difference between those
 
01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:07.350 align:start position:0%
so the the difference between those
lines

01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
eight and lines 16
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
and 22 is that 16 and 22 are referring
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
to the supervising physicians
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay and line eight uh is referring to
 
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
the actual physician assistants
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
um i i would just caution the committee
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh and i i don't have a strong feeling
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
but i would defer to the va on
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to do because you
 
01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to do because you
know

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
it as we all know workforce and health
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
care is a
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
huge is in some level of crisis
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
and um so i don't know if they have
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh physicians from other countries who
 
01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:57.910 align:start position:0%
uh physicians from other countries who
are

01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
working i know they do have physicians
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
from other countries
 
01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
working in their um
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
the i think the the difference here is
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether they have a
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know a u.s license so i have many
 
01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.149 align:start position:0%
you know a u.s license so i have many
colleagues

01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
in the medical field who are really
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
quite outstanding physicians who
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
attended medical school did their
 
01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:26.149 align:start position:0%
attended medical school did their
residency

01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
residency
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
and other training abroad came to the
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
united states they
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
are among the top in their field either
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
at harvard or
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
duke or barnes or any of the
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful hospitals but they are
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
licensed to practice in the united
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
states so
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
the only question i would i would defer
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
to the va
 
01:17:49.590 --> 01:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
on this um i think
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be limiting physicians
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
um by their country or state of origin
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
as much as we would want to be sure they
 
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
and that that's what's highly regulated
 
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of their
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
competency so and also
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
by the way not just competency but their
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing monitoring
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
because we are one of the most highly
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
monitored uh occupations i think
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
that there is probably next to airline
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
pilots um
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
so i would on that question on that
 
01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.229 align:start position:0%
so i would on that question on that
amendment

01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
i would just caution
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure if there's going to be a
 
01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.550 align:start position:0%
to make sure if there's going to be a
change

01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
that we're not blocking supervision by
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
out-of-country physicians but we want
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
those physicians that
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
are supervising to be licensed
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
in the united states not that they have
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
to be from the united states
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
um so anyway that that's my only comment
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
and i would defer to the va
 
01:19:02.310 --> 01:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh the people from the va as to uh
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
the exact wording here and whether as as
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
far as i know right now they have
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
no out of country physicians
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
on their staff but it would be better to
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
ask them that
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other questions
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
for senator sherman
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
representative merchant ah thank you mr
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you senator for taking
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:19:27.669 --> 01:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
um i concur with the issue of having
 
01:19:27.679 --> 01:19:28.470 align:start position:0%
um i concur with the issue of having
licensure

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
within the u.s versus the country in
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
which they reside
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
and following that theme would it be
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
logical then for a physician assistant
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
to also be licensed by new hampshire
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
or state within the united states if you
 
01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.149 align:start position:0%
or state within the united states if you
will

01:19:42.149 --> 01:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
back to the same concern is that we have
 
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
a standard of care
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
which is what licensing board creates
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore if the physician assistant
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to be
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
practicing in hampshire in you will
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
within the united states that they would
 
01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
within the united states that they would
be

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
required to have a license by
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
a state agency in one of the states
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of the country they come from
 
01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:04.790 align:start position:0%
regardless of the country they come from
it's

01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
not so much a question of where the
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
residence is what country they're from
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
but do they actually in fact hold a
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
legitimate license to practice here
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the united states
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question as i
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned in my little introduction
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
currently in statute so um
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
i was i was asked to reinstate it
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
with my floor amendment um so
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
i agree with you though that the key
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
again not only to setting level of
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
competency which is licensure
 
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's nursing or physicians or
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
pas but
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
also being able to monitor you know one
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
of the things
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
we learned in exeter back with the
 
01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
hepatitis c
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
outbreak is that if you don't monitor
 
01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:56.629 align:start position:0%
outbreak is that if you don't monitor
somebody

01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
you you can't keep track of bad behavior
 
01:20:59.199 --> 01:21:00.070 align:start position:0%
you you can't keep track of bad behavior
and

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we established the only
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
board of registry of medical technicians
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
because the guy who was at exeter had
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
been to 16 other facilities before he
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
came and
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
did did his dastardly deed on
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
on our hospital so um
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
so i think licensure in the u.s for
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
unless there's a compelling argument
 
01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
against that is something that i would
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
be in favor of
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
because it really allows us that ongoing
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
monitoring as well as
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
setting a basic level of competency
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative gay thank you and thank
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
um as a as a non-profit as a non-medical
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
professional person
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at the wording and in
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
line 15 it talks about
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know when it says a person's from
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
another country to me that doesn't say
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
anything about their licensure
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
or their presence so when it says
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
provided they possess
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
a current license in good standing in
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
their respective state or country
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
i thought a doctor to practice here had
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
to be licensed
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
here that's question a
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
question may be answered first okay
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's the same word
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
on that question so it's my
 
01:22:38.719 --> 01:22:39.910 align:start position:0%
on that question so it's my
understanding

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
that within the veterans administration
 
01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.470 align:start position:0%
that within the veterans administration
system

01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
because they have so much flux that they
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
are typically
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
you have to have a license to practice
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
as is mentioned here but
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
it does not necess because it's a
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
federal program
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
you do not necessarily have to have a
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
license i would have to check this but
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
you do not have to have a license in the
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
state in which
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
your va is where where your va is it's
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
sort of like
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
more of a national program you do have
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
to be licensed
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
to practice medicine
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding that it
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to be the state
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire if you look at that
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state licensure laws rules
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
and regulations
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
are suspended now that's physician
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
assistance i'd have to go back and look
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
at the statute
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
for providers whether it's nurse
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
practitioners or physicians
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
so i hope i don't know if that really
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
answers your question i don't have a
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
full answer
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
on how they handle um
 
01:23:58.229 --> 01:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
physicians in the va system but they do
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed
 
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:04.550 align:start position:0%
have to be licensed
hello

01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there are va hospitals
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
all around the world
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
in which case you would have employ
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
you could be employing doctors from or
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
medical care people
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
from that country which could be spelled
 
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised surprised the bill doesn't
 
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
say exactly everything
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
but i would think that they would have
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
licensed where they are practicing
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
is that certainly if they're from
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
another country that doesn't
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know that seems immaterial are they
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
licensed to practice
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
where they are and that would
 
01:24:50.310 --> 01:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
if it said that it would cover
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh medical facilities around the world
 
01:24:58.390 --> 01:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned about where they're
 
01:24:58.400 --> 01:24:59.030 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned about where they're
licensed

01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
because it appears multiple places in
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
right remember this thank you for the
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
question this bill is
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
only about physician assistance this is
 
01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.270 align:start position:0%
only about physician assistance this is
not

01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with licensure for physicians or
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's trying to address the issue
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
pas who want to practice at the va
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
and because of the set the structure of
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
the va
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
they have physicians from other states
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
and apparently other countries although
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
i've been told they don't have any
 
01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.990 align:start position:0%
i've been told they don't have any
currently

01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
and so a pa cannot practice in the state
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
without having a physician supervisor
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
so that's the the entire intent of the
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
bill we are not trying to go
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
into the va rules and regulations
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire statutes that work
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
with the va
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
when it comes to providers like nurse
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners or physicians
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
you raise a good question about what are
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
those rules and regs
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
but some of it is federal because the va
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
is a federal system
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
and some of it is how new hampshire has
 
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.110 align:start position:0%
and some of it is how new hampshire has
adapted

01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
adapted
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
to allow the va to continue in
 
01:26:14.159 --> 01:26:15.030 align:start position:0%
to allow the va to continue in
manchester

01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i would also
 
01:26:17.679 --> 01:26:18.070 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that i would also
say

01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
is that our goal here is to make it
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
easier for our veterans to access
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
the care they need that's the goal and
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
the way this bill makes that
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
easier is by allowing our pas to
 
01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.270 align:start position:0%
easier is by allowing our pas to
practice

01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
at the manchester va and their
 
01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.390 align:start position:0%
at the manchester va and their
facilities

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
that's all this is intended to do it's
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
not trying to change
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
existing statute it's just trying to
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that new hampshire pas
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
can practice under the supervision
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
of a a va
 
01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:59.270 align:start position:0%
of a a va
doctor

01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you senator sherman is there
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else who has not asked a couple
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
of questions who would like to ask a
 
01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.470 align:start position:0%
of questions who would like to ask a
question

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative weber thank you
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh just just so we're clear
 
01:27:21.350 --> 01:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
we have before us a bill with some
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
changes on
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
line um
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
1516 that we've been discussing and some
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
and 20 and 21 that we've been discussing
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
and we also have an amendment
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
that had that changes some of that
 
01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.270 align:start position:0%
that had that changes some of that
language

01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
and it am i correct in understanding
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
that the bill
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
as it brought was brought to us
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
would allow the supervising physician
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
to be licensed either in any state in
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
the united states
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
or in another country and that is as the
 
01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.229 align:start position:0%
or in another country and that is as the
language

01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the statute is now anyway and
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment would restrict
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
licensing only to those
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
restrict supervision only to those
 
01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.590 align:start position:0%
restrict supervision only to those
physicians

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
who have a license somewhere in the
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
united states is that
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
a fair assessment of where we are right
 
01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.229 align:start position:0%
a fair assessment of where we are right
now

01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh i do not have a copy of the amendment
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
apologize my concern from whoever was
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
reading the amendment
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
earlier was that it didn't do that my
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
concern was that what it did was it said
 
01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.590 align:start position:0%
concern was that what it did was it said
that

01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh physicians from other countries
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman could not and
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
that's that would be a problem if it's
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
if it's limiting licensure to u.s they
 
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
have to have a u.s
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
license remember what you're doing in
 
01:28:50.719 --> 01:28:51.270 align:start position:0%
license remember what you're doing in
this

01:28:51.270 --> 01:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
is um and and it's
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's fine because you're restricting it
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
to pas but i would be
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
cautious about limiting what physicians
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
can practice
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
or which physicians can practice at the
 
01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.590 align:start position:0%
or which physicians can practice at the
va

01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
va
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
all you're doing here if you have this
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
amendment as
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping it's written i see
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
looking like it it probably does just
 
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
limit it to licensure in the united
 
01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.910 align:start position:0%
limit it to licensure in the united
states

01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
if that's what it does it's saying that
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
if you have a pa
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire that wants to
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
practice at the va
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
that pa can be monitored can be
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
supervised by a physician either from
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
the united states or another country but
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
they have to have a u.s license
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
might i just read you the language um
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
i i'm up to that i'd like to do
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
something that i did once before and
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is actually call upon the person
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
who is the prime of the amendment
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh and representative webber i'll circle
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
back around but representative kenner
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
could you uh please clarify
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh your intent in the amendment and dr
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
blitz has this
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes yes because i i did want to speak
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
but since i was
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
testifying i couldn't speak or ask a
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
first important understand that the
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
amendment does not affect
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
people who just happen to come from
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
another country
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
indeed we have an enormous number of
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
foreign foreign-born graduates who work
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
in this country it has to do with just
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
licensure and what it says in the
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
current statute 328
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
d2a it says new hampshire state
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
licensure laws regulations
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
for physicians assistance are hereby
 
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
suspended for those
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
physician assistants from other states
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
or countries
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
it never says physicians
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
so that so when they ask it to be put in
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
the other language
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
from the statute and the word physicians
 
01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
from other countries
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
that does not exist in the statute the
 
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
issue was that it had to cover
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
out of country physician assistants
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
because there are some of those
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
who are in existence i don't know if
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
they're currently employed
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
so the point is this amendment
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
does not bring back the current
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
and what it does it for example let's
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
say you are from england
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
and you are going to be working on the
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
va system and
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
but you're going to be licensed in this
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
country where your license is going to
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
come from a state
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
and you will not get for example a
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
license in the state of massachusetts
 
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
unless you were
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
residing there when you applied for it
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
so that's why when you say from another
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
state that person from massachusetts can
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
come up and work at the
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
va with no problem because they are
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of massachusetts
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
the fact they're born in another country
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with uh
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
with what we're talking about we're not
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
talking about birthplace the licensure
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
um that basically what happened is when
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
i read this it caught my eye
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
bill marsh and i were both sponsors uh
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and the language wasn't in
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
what we signed off on
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
and that's when i found out it was
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
supposedly it was to add this language
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
from the statute in but i put
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
the original bill and the statute and
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
all this up and
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
another computer i kept going back and
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
forth and it just simply doesn't exist
 
01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
about out-of-country
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
physicians it's out-of-country physician
 
01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.430 align:start position:0%
physicians it's out-of-country physician
assistance

01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
so anyway the point is if you look at
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
the wording on
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment it it simply takes out
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
in line 15 physicians from other
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
countries uh well actually you look at
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
the whole sentence
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
physicians from other states are
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
countries provided that possess a
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
current license a good standing in their
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
respective state or
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
country because the way it was written a
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
person licensed just to practice
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
only in uh let us say south africa
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
but not licensed at all in the united
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
states would be able to supervise one of
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
the pas that's what the
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
that's what a strict reading would say
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
as it is now
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
that person could be born in south
 
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
africa trained in south africa
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
moved to united states licensed in the
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
state of virginia
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
is now transferred up to work at the va
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly able to do that because
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
they're licensed in a u.s
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
state so that's all it does is i think
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
it clarifies that and i don't think it
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
may i personally don't think it makes
 
01:33:07.679 --> 01:33:08.470 align:start position:0%
may i personally don't think it makes
confusing

01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
but if indeed our grammatical coaches
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative weber feel that it
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
still is not clear then we might want to
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
redraft it
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
to make certain that it says that it
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't preclude a person born
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
out of the country but again because you
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
can't get a state a licensure in this
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
country without having
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
at least resided here for a while i
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
think that's not a problem
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
and so the second part there in line 20
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
again just gets out of the word
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
out of country physicians uh because
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
again it's referring to
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
so they actually licensure this it's not
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
referring to where they're born
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
and yeah i'll take questions obviously
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
well not yet
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
you were not going you just no problem i
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
just want to say that
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
the goal is to make it work i'm not
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
worried i'm not wedded to this language
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
if it's not right fix it
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
all right could i just comment on the
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
amendment then
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
yes senator sherman so
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
i would ask representative knurk to
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that he has looked at existing
 
01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:10.870 align:start position:0%
make sure that he has looked at existing
statute

01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
for va physicians practice which i
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh just to make sure that this does not
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
run afoul of what we allow the va to
 
01:34:19.679 --> 01:34:22.709 align:start position:0%
run afoul of what we allow the va to
have

01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
i i in other words i would check with
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
the va
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
and check with statute to make sure this
 
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't have
 
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences for
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh anybody but i agree with the i don't
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
the intent of this which i and i do
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
agree that uh
 
01:34:44.550 --> 01:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that our pas are
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
supervised by people who have licenses
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the united states may i answer to
 
01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.109 align:start position:0%
in the united states may i answer to
that

01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
checking i checked with linda martino
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
who is going to be seeking and richard
 
01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:55.830 align:start position:0%
who is going to be seeking and richard
laflamme

01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
laflamme
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
they are the pas and the people from the
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
va who are involved in this
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
because they did multiple emails back
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
and forth and they were in agreement
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
that this part regarding out-of-country
 
01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
that this part regarding out-of-country
physicians

01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
could be struck but let's hear it
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
straight from them before not processed
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
through me they'll be coming up
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
i know that they're listed on the
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
testifying list as well thank you all
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
right i'm going to circle back his
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i just wanted
 
01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i just wanted
to

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
say that i think the the reason i wanted
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
to read the language
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
to senator sherman
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
is that i think that the language says
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
much more clearly and in many fewer
 
01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:36.470 align:start position:0%
much more clearly and in many fewer
words

01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
exactly what representative clerk just
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
explained to us
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i also wanted to let senator sherman
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
know that i have taken a photograph
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the amendment and i got it thank you
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
and i've also asked uh committee
 
01:35:53.189 --> 01:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
services to
 
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
email you a copy so you shall soon be in
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
undated with copies of
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
amendment 1107h but
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
the language as drafted in the amendment
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
says may be supervised by physicians
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
and here is the problem that might come
 
01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
up because it says
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
from other states and we don't care
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
where they're
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
from we care where they're licensed the
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
second half says
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
provided they possess a current license
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
and good standing in their represent
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
in their respective state so we may need
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
to remove the words
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
from other states because
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
as has been said a number of times we
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't care where they're
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
from they could be from anywhere
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
provided they have a license in good
 
01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:44.149 align:start position:0%
provided they have a license in good
standing

01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
standing
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
in one of the other united states
 
01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
as opposed to anywhere else so i think
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
there may be room for
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
a little more work but i think we're
 
01:36:54.639 --> 01:36:56.070 align:start position:0%
a little more work but i think we're
getting

01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah the only uh the only other comment
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
i'd make uh
 
01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
on that is and i'd have to think this
 
01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:02.950 align:start position:0%
on that is and i'd have to think this
through

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
is whether that actually has to read may
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
be supervised by physicians from new
 
01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.390 align:start position:0%
be supervised by physicians from new
hampshire

01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
or other states because we don't want it
 
01:37:11.199 --> 01:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
or other states because we don't want it
to

01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
exclude although the may may allow it to
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
you don't want to say well they can't be
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
supervised by a physician from new
 
01:37:22.239 --> 01:37:22.790 align:start position:0%
supervised by a physician from new
hampshire

01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
because it says only from other states
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
so i'm just follow up mr chairman
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
yes please if instead of saying
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
by super uh
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
by physicians from other states which
 
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
by physicians from other states which
then

01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
might arguably preclude physicians from
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
other countries
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
if we said by physicians
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
not licensed in new hampshire because
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's the license that we care about not
 
01:37:58.410 --> 01:37:58.420 align:start position:0%
where they're from
 
01:37:58.420 --> 01:37:59.910 align:start position:0%
where they're from
[Music]

01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
may be supervised by physicians not
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
licensed in new hampshire
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
provided they possess a current license
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
in good standing
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
from one of the united states
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
or however i think that that sounds good
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
and it could be just
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
it could stay in their respective state
 
01:38:23.270 --> 01:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
um right but however you wanted to do
 
01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:23.669 align:start position:0%
um right but however you wanted to do
well

01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
i think weird that they've got to have a
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
a license from somewhere in the united
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you another question about this
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
um excuse me representative woods is up
 
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.990 align:start position:0%
um excuse me representative woods is up
next

01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um and uh thank
 
01:38:44.639 --> 01:38:45.030 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um and uh thank
you

01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
senator sherman uh good to see you um
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh had actually several questions some
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
of which have been answered
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
um i i just going through from uh
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
my first question was in the first line
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh line five
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
on the amended senate bill uh new
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire state licensure laws rules and
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
regulations for physician assistance
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
the way i read it and i'm not an
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
attorney uh that would seem that that
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
would suspend
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
any licensure laws
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
suspend any rules would suspend any
 
01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:20.790 align:start position:0%
suspend any rules would suspend any
regulations

01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
my sense that it would should read
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
because we're only dealing with
 
01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.270 align:start position:0%
because we're only dealing with
licensure

01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire state laws
 
01:39:31.750 --> 01:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
regarding new hampshire state laws rules
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
and regulations regarding licensure
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
because otherwise it seems like it would
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
read that they would be
 
01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
not subject to the board of medicines
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
other besides licensing that wouldn't be
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
subjected to
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations as promulgated
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
by the board of medicine
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
which and again i may be uh i'm not an
 
01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:55.990 align:start position:0%
which and again i may be uh i'm not an
attorney

01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
and it may read perfectly fine uh right
 
01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.470 align:start position:0%
and it may read perfectly fine uh right
now

01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
um i have uh secondly i have concerns
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
um about this issue of licensure
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
and supervising from a distance
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
the whole concept at least as i
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
was that there was some kind of
 
01:40:17.679 --> 01:40:18.790 align:start position:0%
was that there was some kind of
cooperative

01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
01:40:21.109 --> 01:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
and collaborative i think as a correct
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
rsa term
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
um activity in other words uh
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
when i was in practice we had pas in the
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
office and if there was a difficulty and
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
just like um sir
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
senator our representative marsh if
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
question comes up they're right there we
 
01:40:38.159 --> 01:40:39.030 align:start position:0%
question comes up they're right there we
can

01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
collaborate and formulate a plan
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
i have concerns about being at a
 
01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:46.310 align:start position:0%
i have concerns about being at a
distance

01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
distance
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
and what that means if it's uh
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
something uh that occurs at three in the
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
morning am i going to call somebody in
 
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:54.790 align:start position:0%
morning am i going to call somebody in
arizona

01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
arizona
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
um i don't know that that really works
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
very well
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh so i have i have i understand and i i
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
understand the need
 
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
and i understand the intent and i'm i
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
really would like to work
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
such that we can do that um i'm not too
 
01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
sure the way it's
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
formulated and the way it's worded right
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
now that it accomplishes that
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
i do have concerns that this is also a
 
01:41:19.199 --> 01:41:22.629 align:start position:0%
i do have concerns that this is also a
um

01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
a situation that could be a precedent
 
01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
let's pretend and read the read the rsa
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
how would that would we do that for
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
convenient md
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
now if i if i could just uh
 
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
jump to your second question first
 
01:41:50.750 --> 01:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
the intent here is not to have
 
01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
the intent here is not to have
telesupervision

01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
telesupervision
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
these are physicians practicing at the
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
manchester va
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
is my understanding who are overseeing
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
so they are actually practicing at the
 
01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.350 align:start position:0%
so they are actually practicing at the
va

01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
va
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
they don't practice outside the va and
 
01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
they do not have a new hampshire license
 
01:42:12.149 --> 01:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
they have a license in another state
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
because the va system
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier is a federal
 
01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:16.950 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier is a federal
system

01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
so this would not be somebody
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
supervising a pa from arizona this would
 
01:42:23.189 --> 01:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
be somebody
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
who has an arizona license practicing at
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
the va in manchester
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
and directly supervising the pa
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay so that may be my mit that may i'm
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
not reading it correctly then
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
the way i read it is that they could be
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
no no no it's not
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with site or site
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
of origin or any telemedicine or
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
telesupervision i think that would be
 
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
setting a huge precedent for pas
 
01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh and that would stated well
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
um i i leave that up to the committee
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think it needs to be stated
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
because it would certainly
 
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
never i don't see that as being allowed
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh but um you know we'd have to go into
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
va rules and regs and all that kind of
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
stuff but my understanding is that
 
01:43:18.229 --> 01:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
this is direct supervision which is the
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
standard of practice for
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
pas certainly in new hampshire um
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
and then and and if the committee
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
feels that that needs to be specified
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
i'm absolutely fine with that
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
because i agree with you representative
 
01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:35.750 align:start position:0%
because i agree with you representative
wood

01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
wood
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
woods that this is we're not we're not
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
embarking on
 
01:43:43.910 --> 01:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
tele supervision uh the second one
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
is seven through nine um
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
is existing statute it's beyond the
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
scope of
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill and the actual
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
bill to try to rewrite
 
01:44:01.109 --> 01:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
existing statute this was to make it
 
01:44:01.119 --> 01:44:02.470 align:start position:0%
existing statute this was to make it
possible

01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
the single goal of this bill was to make
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
it possible
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
for pas from new hampshire to be
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
working at the va under the supervision
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
non-new hampshire physician that's the
 
01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:16.709 align:start position:0%
non-new hampshire physician that's the
goal

01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
goal
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
and so if the i
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
i think you could have mission creep if
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
you try to get into that because we
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
you would have to be absolutely sure
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
that you are not impacting
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
current standards of practice at the va
 
01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:33.030 align:start position:0%
current standards of practice at the va
um

01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:36.950 --> 01:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
but uh i hear your concern uh but it is
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
not within the goal of this bill
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
to impact that first part of that of
 
01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:44.709 align:start position:0%
to impact that first part of that of
chapter

01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%

01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
interrupting before um i understand that
 
01:44:59.040 --> 01:44:59.590 align:start position:0%
interrupting before um i understand that
the

01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
um term and out of state
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
is already in statute or there's some
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
question about whether it is or not but
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
um out of state
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
would preclude people who were not in
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
another state but were licensed in the
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
united states
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question yes so
 
01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:31.270 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question yes so
maybe

01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
state or territory uh
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
would be more inclusive and i see
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative kanerk is got his red pen
 
01:45:40.639 --> 01:45:40.950 align:start position:0%
representative kanerk is got his red pen
out

01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
in other states um
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
however um on line 19 it says
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
out of state so out of state could
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
include those territories but
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
in another state would not include those
 
01:45:59.199 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
in another state would not include those
territories

01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:01.770 align:start position:0%
territories
 
01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:04.709 align:start position:0%

since last week on a bill that this

01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
passed last year the senate signed it
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the governor
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
signed it and it i know
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
i'm moneying the waters by bringing in a
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill that's not part of this public
 
01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:01.510 align:start position:0%
bill that's not part of this public
hearing

hearing
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
but i need welcome senator snow i want
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%

01:47:05.119 --> 01:47:05.350 align:start position:0%
to hear that and i think it's going to
be

01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:47:07.189 --> 01:47:07.199 align:start position:0%
important but can we push you back in
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
the line absolutely
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm writing uh your name
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
here it's not a prayer request for
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
precipitation it is a reminder to me
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure you get to do that anyone
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
else who has not
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%

01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative gay one more okay

thank you um thank you for clarifying
 
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
goal of this since we've talked about
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
many details
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i will state what i
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
think the goal of this
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
is of this bill and amendment and
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
please correct it if it's not right to
 
01:47:46.719 --> 01:47:47.350 align:start position:0%
please correct it if it's not right to
me

01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
the goal is to allow hiring
 
01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
pas from other states or countries
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
so that they can work under
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
at the of anywhere in the va coordinated
 
01:48:03.669 --> 01:48:03.679 align:start position:0%
through the veterans
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
the amc work under the direct
 
01:48:07.119 --> 01:48:08.709 align:start position:0%
the amc work under the direct
supervision

01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
of a doctor who is
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
certified to work for the va i'm trying
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
to circumvent
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
state law versus federal law on
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing the physician
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
but the whole goal is to allow us to
 
01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:24.390 align:start position:0%
but the whole goal is to allow us to
hire

01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
hire
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
more pas who are not licensed
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
in this state but they are
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
licensed well i don't even not even
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
quite sure
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
where they're licensed but they would
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
work under
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
a licensed physician
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
who is appropriately credentialed
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
to work in the va um
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um the answer
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
the it is already allowed for
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
a pa in lines seven through nine
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
in existing statute for pas
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
from other states or countries to work
 
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
what is not currently allowed based on
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statute
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
is for new hampshire licensed pas
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
to work under the supervision of
 
01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:22.149 align:start position:0%
to work under the supervision of
physicians

01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
who do not have a new hampshire license
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the only place in the state that i
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
know of where
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
this would apply is at the va
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
so new hampshire pas
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
who want to practice at the va currently
 
01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
half can only practice under a provider
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
under a physician who has a new
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire license
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
and and that there's a possibility that
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
no one working at the va would fit that
 
01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:03.750 align:start position:0%
no one working at the va would fit that
description

01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
description
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
um because the va is a federal system
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
and their physicians are licensed as
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
but but they may not be licensed in the
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
state in which they're practicing
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
so because it's a federal system so what
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
that means
 
01:50:25.189 --> 01:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
is that in this setting the pas
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
covered under the bill are new hampshire
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
licensed pas they have to identify a
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
supervising physician
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
and this bill makes it possible for them
 
01:50:36.310 --> 01:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
to work
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
at the va taking care of our new
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire veterans
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of a
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
va physician
 
01:50:49.910 --> 01:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
who may not have a new hampshire license
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's all the bill does
 
01:50:56.070 --> 01:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't address pas from out of
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
state that's
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%

this board will have
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
or the the impact of this legislation
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
will have direct effect
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh in my life in that i work for the
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%

01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
see veterans in their home
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
my medical director dr joseph leinert
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
has uh also
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh offered his support for this
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislation and this morning i
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
forwarded an email to um dr
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
kirk and uh sherman uh voicing that
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
concern he currently represents 25
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
of all of the pas that work at the
 
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
manchester va
 
01:53:59.030 --> 01:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
and he is licensed in maine so while he
 
01:54:00.709 --> 01:54:00.719 align:start position:0%
is our medical director as it has been
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
he cannot serve as my direct uh
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
supervising physician
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
and for both an administrative function
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
as well as just the clarity of having
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
that direct collaborative agreement with
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
the physician
 
01:54:14.070 --> 01:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
who's in the best position to help me
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
manage our veterans at home
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
i really do appreciate the leadership um
 
01:54:19.119 --> 01:54:19.510 align:start position:0%
i really do appreciate the leadership um
to

01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
identify this gap and to potentially
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
close it
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
using these documents i agree that the
 
01:54:27.910 --> 01:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
scope and scale of it
 
01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
is limited to what we were intending to
 
01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.270 align:start position:0%
is limited to what we were intending to
allow

01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
my boss for example to supervise me
 
01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:35.589 align:start position:0%
my boss for example to supervise me
directly

01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
directly
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
to meet the board of medicine
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
requirements i value the collaboration
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
and i think instead of having to find
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
other physicians from outside of other
 
01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:44.629 align:start position:0%
other physicians from outside of other
departments

01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
who happen to be licensed in new
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire we find ourselves
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
meeting the law but more the spirit of
 
01:54:50.639 --> 01:54:51.510 align:start position:0%
meeting the law but more the spirit of
it

01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
rather than that actual collaborative
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
agreement would more accurately reflect
 
01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
my practice so thank you so much for
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
creating this this forum and allowing me
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
to participate
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to answer any specific
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
question about my practice
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the va um to assuage any other fears
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
that may not have been addressed so far
 
01:55:15.850 --> 01:55:15.860 align:start position:0%
any questions from angela flom
 
01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:17.510 align:start position:0%
any questions from angela flom
[Music]

01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative merchants thank you mr
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:55:22.239 --> 01:55:23.350 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
um mister blom
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
as far as working in the va system it's
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding hopefully you can
 
01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
clarify this for me
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
that in order to work in the va system
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
you have to have a license
 
01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
issued by a state or territory within
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
the united states of the confines of the
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
u.s so therefore if i'm licensed in new
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire i could practice in the va
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
system in california hawaii wherever
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
else i wanted to
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's the same with a physician
 
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.390 align:start position:0%
i think it's the same with a physician
assistant

01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
so that's the question before you is
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
when you're in the va system
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
do you in fact have to have a license
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
issued by a state or territory in the us
 
01:56:04.790 --> 01:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely true in some cases
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
what people will do is they'll find the
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
the most expeditious license if you will
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
the easiest one to maintain
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
or one that was more in keeping with
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
what they're hoping for with minimal
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens
 
01:56:17.830 --> 01:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
and as a result our we may have more
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
physician assistants that are here in
 
01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:20.229 align:start position:0%
physician assistants that are here in
working

01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
but just have not elected to use the new
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire licensure
 
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
because of some of these cumbersome
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for supervising
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh agreements you are 100 correct that
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the federal government is uh both in
 
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
the military and as well as in the va
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
very very uh strict in their
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
credentialing um
 
01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's exhaustive uh every year we we we
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
go through it we dread it
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of checks and balances but
 
01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
they only work within that federal
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
system and if they were to leave that or
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
to seek employment outside of the va as
 
01:56:54.070 --> 01:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps moonlighting or whatever else
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
they would have to pursue that new
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire license
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
and and as it pointed out by colleagues
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh today
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
this is only to work within that federal
 
01:57:02.719 --> 01:57:03.589 align:start position:0%
this is only to work within that federal
system

01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
the one other little caveat would be
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
there are other federal organizations
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
like the prison system
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
that could potentially hire a pa but
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's not currently true
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
so i can say that this is a fairly
 
01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:17.430 align:start position:0%
so i can say that this is a fairly
limited

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
limited
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
scope and scale but again a new
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire pa
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
might go work in a different va
 
01:57:25.669 --> 01:57:25.679 align:start position:0%
outside of new hampshire and would be
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
able to maintain
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
their work in that new va facility be it
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
in arizona
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
while using a new hampshire license
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
because of the rules of working at a
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
federal system
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
so you're right you have to have a
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
license in a state or territory in order
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
to function
 
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
there are not facilities outside of the
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
country that are not specifically
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
designed to meet the needs of
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
veterans it did just have some future
 
01:57:48.719 --> 01:57:49.109 align:start position:0%
veterans it did just have some future
proof

01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
proof
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
language regarding perhaps pas that may
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
someday will be trained out of country
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
but they would still have to be licensed
 
01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
in a state or territory in order to gain
 
01:57:58.880 --> 01:57:59.990 align:start position:0%
in a state or territory in order to gain
employment

01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
employment
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
those rules are very you know are
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
updated periodically
 
01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
but there has been absolutely no change
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
and as
 
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
has been pointed out it is not a
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
reflection of any
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
changes in scope scale of practice or
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
telemedicine it is
 
01:58:16.310 --> 01:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
simply a measure of maintaining new
 
01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:17.430 align:start position:0%
simply a measure of maintaining new
hampshire's

01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire's
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
licensure and wanting to be in not only
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
in compliance with those regulations
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
but actually have supervisory agreements
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
that make the most sense
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
by having the right physician who knows
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
the pa
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
able to supervise them in that federal
 
01:58:31.679 --> 01:58:33.189 align:start position:0%
able to supervise them in that federal
setting

01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
setting
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question follow up mr
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
chair follow up
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
if i may so fundamentally look at this
 
01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:40.950 align:start position:0%
if i may so fundamentally look at this
law

01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is allow for
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
treatment of the veterans
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
as if they were in the physical facility
 
01:58:48.629 --> 01:58:48.639 align:start position:0%
of the veteran facility
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
but coordinated home care so they're not
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
being seen inside of a
 
01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
federal facility they've been seen at
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
home or underneath the coordination of
 
01:58:58.229 --> 01:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
the federal system but
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
the practice location of the practice
 
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
setting itself is outside of the federal
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
system so therefore
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
once we step outside of the federal
 
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
system we then come under the state
 
01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.070 align:start position:0%
system we then come under the state
regulations

01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:59:11.189 --> 01:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
so this allows for the va to coordinate
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
activity that's within the state purview
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's under the federal system as far
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
as overseeing it is that kind of what
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get to
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
i think that's right i think the other
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
piece is that of course we have these
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
community-based outreach clinic the c
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
box so
 
01:59:29.350 --> 01:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
it broadens some of that not all veteran
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
care is manchester va
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
but it all happens under the purview the
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
federal government didn't see bucks and
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
in some cases the homes
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:59:42.239 --> 01:59:43.669 align:start position:0%

acton
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
01:59:47.109 --> 01:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
leflan for taking my question
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to briefly ask you more of a
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
general question for those of us who are
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
newer on the on the committee or um
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
aren't medically trained can you give us
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
some insight into the level of of
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
granularity of the supervisory
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
relationship that you have with your
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
physician is it done remotely do you
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
pre-approve things what how much
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
autonomy do you have
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
in your medical practice that's a very
 
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
good question and i appreciate it
 
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
it is a topic um that's probably a
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh different for different pas and and
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
some of that is based upon your
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
degree of experience and what your
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
supervising physician has
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
outlined for you there are collaborative
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
agreements that are there that says
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
these are the things that i'm
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
these are things that i would like you
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
to reach out for in our particular case
 
02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:38.709 align:start position:0%
to reach out for in our particular case
well

02:00:38.709 --> 02:00:38.719 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
my supervising physician um resides
 
02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
in maine he has an office down at the
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
brady syllabus
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
in in manchester and he supervises
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
several uh pas and nurse practitioners
 
02:00:53.910 --> 02:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
and he is always available and there's
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
always one of us that's covering for
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
this patient panel
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
in my particular case there are about 40
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
patients that are
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
around say tilton that he helps
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
collaborate with me
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
for their care we have weekly meetings
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
in a multi-disciplinary
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
setting where the social workers the
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
nurses and the physician all
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
collaborate on the care of our veterans
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure they're getting the
 
02:01:16.870 --> 02:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
resources that they need
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
i may go independently into their home
 
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
to examine them
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
but he would of course always be aware
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
of what's happening
 
02:01:25.430 --> 02:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
because all of my notes are sent to him
 
02:01:27.109 --> 02:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
for both counter signature
 
02:01:29.109 --> 02:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
and while i'm fully licensed within the
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
state to prescribe medication offer
 
02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:32.470 align:start position:0%
state to prescribe medication offer
diagnoses

02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
diagnoses
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
in the sense of collaboration that when
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
on the day when i'm not working he needs
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
to be informed as to what's happening
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i also assist with his patients so
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
it is very much
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
a team sport as medicine is off practice
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere else the degree to which
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
my supervisor feels that he needs to or
 
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
she might need to
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
influence my care or to change what i've
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
done would be done on a case-by-case
 
02:01:58.629 --> 02:01:58.639 align:start position:0%
basis based on the clinical progress of
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
a patient
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
it would be highly unusual that there
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
would be anything that's happening
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
by one of the pas that wasn't
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
immediately available or noticeable to
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
the supervising position
 
02:02:10.950 --> 02:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
we have electronic charts they all sign
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
off on the same thing
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
and we have lots of team members that go
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
in as part of home-based primary care
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're sort of a medical strike team so
 
02:02:21.669 --> 02:02:21.679 align:start position:0%
that collaboration is not just happening
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
from the pas
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
but the social workers and the
 
02:02:24.639 --> 02:02:25.830 align:start position:0%
but the social workers and the
psychologists

02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
psychologists
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
or the pharmacists or the nursing staff
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
all of which
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
we meet together and review weekly the
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
care of our patients
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
i hope that that answers your questions
 
02:02:37.109 --> 02:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
there's a degree of autonomy that comes
 
02:02:37.119 --> 02:02:37.669 align:start position:0%
there's a degree of autonomy that comes
with

02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
years of experience and confidence and a
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
strong relationship with your
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
supervising provider
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
and that could all change if your
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
patient's doing significantly better or
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
significantly worse
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
but it's really based on the actual care
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
okay that's excellent information thank
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
you very much a pleasure
 
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative merchant is this an
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
old hand or a new hand
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's an old hand all right thank you
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh thank you mr chairman
 
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh major leslam for taking
 
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am okay um i'm concerned
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
you're you have been really filling us
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
in it's great information
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know if you have i guess you
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
don't have a copy of the amendment
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me but i'm now because you were
 
02:03:34.560 --> 02:03:35.430 align:start position:0%
excuse me but i'm now because you were
mentioning

02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
mentioning
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
uh something that sounded like cbox i'm
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
concerned to get the wording exactly
 
02:03:41.599 --> 02:03:42.470 align:start position:0%
concerned to get the wording exactly
right

02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
that says who who we are uh
 
02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
who we are describing the current
 
02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:49.669 align:start position:0%
who we are describing the current
wording

02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
wording
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
says um let's see
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
i'll get in the middle of sense because
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lot i think you're speaking of
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
line eight ma'am if i'm correct we were
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
talking about patient service
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
through uh manchester and now it says
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
coordinated through
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
the veterans administration medical
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
center yes
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
vamc at licensed medical facilities
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
which you are not working at
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the manchester vamc so
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
what is the exact way to copy this to
 
02:04:19.119 --> 02:04:20.069 align:start position:0%
what is the exact way to copy this to
call

02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
call
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
the service area that you're working in
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah when we sat down and went over that
 
02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:30.470 align:start position:0%
yeah when we sat down and went over that
language

02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:04:33.750 --> 02:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
it was felt because again some of this
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
language was original to the rsa
 
02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
and how it was defined in the original
 
02:04:38.079 --> 02:04:39.430 align:start position:0%
and how it was defined in the original
exemptions

02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the pas that worked at the
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
manchester va
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
it was felt that coordinated through the
 
02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:48.390 align:start position:0%
it was felt that coordinated through the
vamc

02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
vamc
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
represented the most accurate and
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
simplified language
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
because it allowed recognition that
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
there is both a robust care in the
 
02:04:58.069 --> 02:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
community and that some of the care
 
02:05:01.109 --> 02:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
of our veterans importantly as we do not
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
have a full service
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
medical treatment facility is often done
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
in the community
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
and it's done collaboratively we may ask
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
for consult that happens
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the community and then return to us
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
for ongoing care
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
but this was simplified language that
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
instead of it just
 
02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
implying it only took place at the
 
02:05:19.599 --> 02:05:20.310 align:start position:0%
implying it only took place at the
manchester

02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
campus but rather coordinated through
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
the veterans administration's medical
 
02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:28.550 align:start position:0%
the veterans administration's medical
center

02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:30.550 --> 02:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
it is as an employee that is clear to me
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
but if it is not clear
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
to you then perhaps maybe that should be
 
02:05:35.679 --> 02:05:37.669 align:start position:0%
to you then perhaps maybe that should be
readdressed

02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
readdressed
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
would it be accurate to say coordinated
 
02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:40.950 align:start position:0%
would it be accurate to say coordinated
through

02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:05:44.550 --> 02:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
but not at licensed medical facilities
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
outside the manchester vanc
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
i can see your point and i i would not i
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
would not uh
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
i would think that that would be fine to
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
remove that licensed medical
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
facilities and just use the language uh
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
or the facilities of the manchester
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
um or the department of veteran affairs
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
something that's a little bit more
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
inclusive that makes sense
 
02:06:13.589 --> 02:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative woods
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you uh
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
for out taking my question uh um
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity if uh a situation
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
were to arise
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
about a particular uh pa
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh their standard of care or a problem
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
in their care
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh who would have the ultimate
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility in that regard uh
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
the va system or would they be subject
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
to the board of medicine
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great question and the
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine i've i've since
 
02:06:51.199 --> 02:06:52.149 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine i've i've since
graduated

02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
graduated
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
in 2007 have always been licensed in new
 
02:06:56.079 --> 02:06:57.109 align:start position:0%
in 2007 have always been licensed in new
hampshire

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
both work at concord hospital and
 
02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
throughout my other work and now through
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
the va
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
well i have a additional employer and i
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
have their standard of care
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
and a fortunately a very robust system
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
at the va where veterans and others can
 
02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:13.830 align:start position:0%
at the va where veterans and others can
make

02:07:13.830 --> 02:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
raise concerns and have those concerns
 
02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:17.030 align:start position:0%
raise concerns and have those concerns
addressed

02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
through their professional development i
 
02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
remain fully subject
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire board of medicine
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
for any corrective action
 
02:07:28.550 --> 02:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
any gaps in my care
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
or if a patient had a concern it would
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
be addressed
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
as it would be for any other pa that is
 
02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:35.669 align:start position:0%
as it would be for any other pa that is
licensed

02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire the only difference in
 
02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
this particular case if this exception
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
was granted
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
but that my supervising physician who
 
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
happens to be licensed in maine
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
would also have to answer any concern
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
raised by the board of medicine
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
regarding his pa's scope or scale

after a 25 a year career serving in our
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
air force today i'm here representing
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
the state veterans advisory committee
 
02:09:16.629 --> 02:09:16.639 align:start position:0%
and we are a committee of veteran
 
02:09:18.229 --> 02:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
organizations whose names would be
 
02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
familiar to you like the american legion
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
and the veterans of foreign wars i could
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
i personally represent the air force
 
02:09:26.149 --> 02:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
association but we're chartered by state
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
rsa 110 to essentially speak for the
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
veteran community and one of the things
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
that we do
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
is we review all of the bills that are
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
coming before the legislature
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
we pick out the ones that we think have
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
better impact and then we discuss them
 
02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
and take a position on them and i come
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
and tell you what our position is
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that our members
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
unanimously support this bill
 
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
and as i've listened to the conversation
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
so far this morning
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
i want to give you just a very brief
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
history lesson and maybe
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
something that's going to happen in the
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
future sometime i hope
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh give some perspective to to the
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
businesses that you're making on this
 
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
02:10:04.629 --> 02:10:04.639 align:start position:0%
uh early in the morning of the 19th of
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
july of 2017
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
a pipe burst at the manchester va and it
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
flooded the surgical suite there
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
and uh at the time governor sununu went
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
to the va
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
manchester director whose name was
 
02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:20.470 align:start position:0%
manchester director whose name was
montoya

02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
montoya
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
and he said al what can i do for you and
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
and al said
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
rather than me having just to reschedule
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
surgeries that are set up for veterans
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know at white river junction or
 
02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
having these people have to go down to
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
jamaica plain down in boston
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
what if i got together with another
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
hospital here locally
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
and we sort of extended the va
 
02:10:42.069 --> 02:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
privileges into that hospital and we'll
 
02:10:43.589 --> 02:10:43.599 align:start position:0%
let the lawyers figure out where all the
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
liabilities and everything were
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
so they partnered agreement with
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
catholic medical center
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
and they used their surgical suite while
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
the va medical center was being repaired
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
and uh they the governor signed that
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
executive order and then
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
we thought well you know what we need to
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
codify this into the existing rsa
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
so in the next legislative session in
 
02:11:07.750 --> 02:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
2018 you had house bill 1273
 
02:11:10.069 --> 02:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
that sort of allowed for some of the
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
things you're talking about in this bill
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
people being supervised
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
at different places within the va system
 
02:11:17.830 --> 02:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily in the va
 
02:11:19.910 --> 02:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and i think that this bill goes a
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
long way to to
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
try to get all of the things that are
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
that are included in
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
all of these scenarios what i want you
 
02:11:27.910 --> 02:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
to consider for the future
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
is that that um you know as as
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
senator sherman said we're all
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
interested in getting the care that our
 
02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:34.950 align:start position:0%
interested in getting the care that our
veterans

02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
02:11:37.350 --> 02:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
deserve you know and making it easy for
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
them to get that care
 
02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is the only state in the
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
in the union that does not have a full
 
02:11:43.589 --> 02:11:43.599 align:start position:0%
service va
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
hospital you know we have a veterans
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
choice program which was
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
under was was put together under the
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
obama administration and then was
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
renewed under the trump administration
 
02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:52.950 align:start position:0%
renewed under the trump administration
that

02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
allows some of our veterans to get some
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
services in the local community
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
and we think that's a great step forward
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
but ultimately
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're going to see a
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
full-service va system
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
or va medical center in our lifetime
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
here necessarily in new hampshire
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
but the idea is if we could find some
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
some doctors and some pas maybe that
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
love to ski and want to live in the
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
north country and we could get an
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
arrangement with memorial hospital up in
 
02:12:19.030 --> 02:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
north conway
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
where they essentially have an office up
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
there it would be an extension of the va
 
02:12:24.390 --> 02:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
out in the places
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
where a veteran wouldn't have to drive
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
two hours to manchester for something
 
02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's sort of the
 
02:12:31.750 --> 02:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
direction that we would ultimately like
 
02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
all of this to go
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i was not i was i'm not a doctor i
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
don't play one on tv and i wasn't an
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
english major at the air force academy
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
so i will leave the language of all this
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
stuff up to you folks but our vision for
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
the future is
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know if we can't get a full va
 
02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
service hospital here
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we would love to be
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
able to get the care closer to where the
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
veterans actually are
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
and if that means assigning people
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
within the va system who
 
02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
tend to move around some just like our
 
02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
members of the military move around some
 
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know if we can eliminate some of the
 
02:13:04.229 --> 02:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
the licensing requirement
 
02:13:06.550 --> 02:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
issues as long as they're part of the va
 
02:13:08.069 --> 02:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
system writ large
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
we think that works well and that's all
 
02:13:11.910 --> 02:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
i wanted to tell you all uh subject to
 
02:13:14.229 --> 02:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
any of your questions
 
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
i have a feeling we're going to see you
 
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
back with some more good legislation
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
about the va coming
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
in the years ahead thank you so much for
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony colonel
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
yes sir and now
 
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
i thought a friend had her hand up to
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
ask a question representative
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
you can do that oh um thank you i i
 
02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask colonel
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
grady if it's a short answer
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
what is the va lacking that it's not a
 
02:13:55.119 --> 02:13:55.510 align:start position:0%
what is the va lacking that it's not a
full

02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
full
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
service hospital
 
02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not certain of of the exact
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for a full service hospital
 
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:04.719 align:start position:0%
my guess is that
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
that we're we're not doing 24 hour a day
 
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
operations and our surgical capability
 
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
isn't kind of where you'd want it
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
for a a full service hospital
 
02:14:19.669 --> 02:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
but i i would need i can if you'd like
 
02:14:19.679 --> 02:14:20.390 align:start position:0%
but i i would need i can if you'd like
representative

02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
another on him i i can get uh i'll ask
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
that question
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
to uh our folks at the va and ask them
 
02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
to get back to you with an answer
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i was just curious uh thank
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
you very much colonel
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes i'm wondering if in the interest of
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
inter-service cooperation if army major
 
02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:38.229 align:start position:0%
inter-service cooperation if army major
laflamme

02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
laflamme
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
i think he may not be off the call
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
yeah he's he's off the clock elizabeth
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
major could you answer that question
 
02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
about why the va in manchester is not a
 
02:15:04.239 --> 02:15:04.709 align:start position:0%
about why the va in manchester is not a
full

02:15:04.709 --> 02:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
full
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
hospital i can't i i did talk through my
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
wife's uh she's still streaming this
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
after i i left the zoo
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
she's one of the pa students in question
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
um but we are not
 
02:15:18.870 --> 02:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh beyond our long-term care facility
 
02:15:23.430 --> 02:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh at the clc so it is not a 24 7
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
operation there are limited surgical
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
services and does not have an ongoing
 
02:15:28.709 --> 02:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
inpatient wing
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
and i it was as stated previously
 
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
outside of
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
new hampshire only hawaii lacks these
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
capabilities as states so we do have a
 
02:15:37.199 --> 02:15:40.470 align:start position:0%
capabilities as states so we do have a
limitation

02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and and as an air force major
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
through the civil air patrol i thank the
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
army for that
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative kanark yeah yes thank you
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
very much i just didn't want to
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
represent another offhand to be
 
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh missed so what i did is just for
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
those of you who have access to your
 
02:15:57.520 --> 02:15:58.390 align:start position:0%
those of you who have access to your
email

02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
email
 
02:16:01.669 --> 02:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
um well mr lafama speaking i was
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
actually trying to put together the
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
things that came out
 
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
as best i understood linguistically to
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
make this better
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
we obviously don't have to wordsmith it
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly now but i want to make sure we
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
have it
 
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
accurate before the next time we get
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
together representative marsh and i
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
just tried to do an end run and get this
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
thing in place so that we could execute
 
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
thing in place so that we could execute
today

02:16:20.550 --> 02:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
but clearly we failed on that because we
 
02:16:24.790 --> 02:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have some good language on it
 
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
so if you are able to open your email
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
but i'll also just say it verbally
 
02:16:32.549 --> 02:16:32.559 align:start position:0%
so what i addressed in that line 16
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
requesting licensure in new hampshire
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
may be supervised by physicians
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
not licensed in new hampshire provided
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
they possess a current license
 
02:16:48.629 --> 02:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
in good standing in their respective
 
02:16:49.669 --> 02:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
state or
 
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
territory of the u.s that way we have
 
02:16:54.389 --> 02:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
taken care of not excluding new
 
02:16:54.399 --> 02:16:55.270 align:start position:0%
taken care of not excluding new
hampshire

02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
physicians we've taken care of not
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
excluding somebody from puerto rico um
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
and we're not discussing uh you know
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
where the physician is from but
 
02:17:07.030 --> 02:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
simply the licensure then on line
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
22 uh i changed that
 
02:17:14.469 --> 02:17:14.479 align:start position:0%
to saying although 21 22 uh offering
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
services to the state of new hampshire
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
and out-of-state
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
licensed physicians accepting
 
02:17:19.599 --> 02:17:20.709 align:start position:0%
licensed physicians accepting
supervisory

02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
supervisory
 
02:17:23.190 --> 02:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh responsibility in other words not
 
02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
worrying about
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know just that they're from
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
out-of-state but where they're licensed
 
02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:28.070 align:start position:0%
out-of-state but where they're licensed
from

02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:17:29.589 --> 02:17:29.599 align:start position:0%
i just need feedback from people as
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
whether that satisfies the requirements
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
of the discussion we had
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i do apologize i will do this later
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
because i think he's off the call
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
to um senator sherman for not sending
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
him this draft amendment that would have
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
been smarter but i didn't
 
02:17:46.469 --> 02:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
the other questions though that come up
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
are that question that
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
representative woods brought up about
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
did we suspend all regulations and rules
 
02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:55.519 align:start position:0%
and should we insert a phrase just
 
02:17:55.519 --> 02:17:56.309 align:start position:0%
and should we insert a phrase just
saying

02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state licenses line seven
 
02:18:01.349 --> 02:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state licensure laws rules
 
02:18:03.429 --> 02:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
and regulations regarding licensure and
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
supervision for physician assistance
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
inserting the words regarding life
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
insurance supervision to make sure
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
that we're not suspending every rule for
 
02:18:12.319 --> 02:18:13.990 align:start position:0%
that we're not suspending every rule for
them

02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
the last one i guess would be what came
 
02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
up then in that discussion about that
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
not all
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
care is at a licensed facility
 
02:18:24.309 --> 02:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
and should we strike the language at
 
02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
licensed medical facilities just if it's
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
coordinated through the va
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
so if people could give me some quick
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
feedback on that then
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh i will with bill marsh
 
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
drafts another amendment but i want
 
02:18:39.509 --> 02:18:39.519 align:start position:0%
feedback from people
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
do we need that change in line seven
 
02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
and again the changes i put in red i did
 
02:18:50.549 --> 02:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
not put
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
the change from the conversation with
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
and mr laflamme because i was composing
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
this as that went on
 
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
and sent it and did not get that into
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
there so first
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
and represented woodstock on line seven
 
02:19:04.950 --> 02:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
do we need to put a restriction on what
 
02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:05.349 align:start position:0%
do we need to put a restriction on what
the

02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
um suspension has to do with or is it
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
or do you think it was already obvious
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't hurt to me it doesn't hurt if
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's obvious
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
to adding okay by the word but i think
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's a good concept
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes fair enough and then line 11
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
shall we uh strike their language at
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
licensed medical facilities outside of
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
the manchester vamc
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
just because then that if you're doing
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
jerry represents um i think we should
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
be careful because there needs to be
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
some language in there
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the relationship between
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
the facility does exist with the va
 
02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
under contract of some capacity it does
 
02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:51.750 align:start position:0%
under contract of some capacity it does
a

02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
relatively large the other question i'd
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
say as long as i went through
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
amendment suggestions the other issue
 
02:19:58.870 --> 02:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
which didn't
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
raise before if you're an out of country
 
02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:02.309 align:start position:0%
raise before if you're an out of country
physician

02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
physician
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
or pa and you prescribe in new hampshire
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we cannot fill the
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
prescription at the pharmacy
 
02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
we'll have to go to the va because we're
 
02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:13.030 align:start position:0%
we'll have to go to the va because we're
only

02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to fill a prescription by a
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
licensed physician or pa
 
02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
fair enough as long as again in this
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
case all we're doing is changing that
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
issue about the supervising
 
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
physician they already have the out of
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
state uh pas there
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't know it's out of country as
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
long as the outer country's taken out of
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
it completely
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
oh well that's good but that's gone
 
02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
anyway all right but the other one
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
though is i'd rather be sure that we
 
02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
have some sort of
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
restriction or we tend to have
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
a contractual relationship between the
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
va system and whatever
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
the pa is overseeing or working in well
 
02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
the language would still be there that
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
would say
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
offering medical services coordinated
 
02:21:01.110 --> 02:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
through the va
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
so it would have to be coordinated
 
02:21:03.270 --> 02:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
through them there'd have to be a
 
02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:05.510 align:start position:0%
through them there'd have to be a
relationship

02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
that language would be still there just
 
02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:08.710 align:start position:0%
that language would be still there just
the

02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's line 10 it would just take out
 
02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
line 11 that talks about
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
at licensed medical facilities
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
i think that still worked for you i i
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
think the word coordinated is kind of
 
02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:20.710 align:start position:0%
think the word coordinated is kind of
broad

02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
broad
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
um i think it could be okay but i think
 
02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
again back to the same thing where it's
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
obvious is that
 
02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
there is a contractual relationship
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
because if the patient
 
02:21:32.389 --> 02:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
does go to that facility is they're
 
02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
really trying to do is they're coming
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
under the hospice of the va
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
system and that should be done through a
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
contract not just the fact that they're
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
coordinated so
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
the patient is getting the same level of
 
02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
care and services
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
that they would have in the va system
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
itself if they're outside of it
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
so that only can be done we only can
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that if there's a contractual
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
relationship between the va system and
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
well i've got a few more in the queue
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
here thank you representative merchant
 
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
there we go sorry about that line 18 it
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
says territory
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
united states what is district of
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:34.630 --> 02:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
i just looked it up it's a territory
 
02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:35.429 align:start position:0%
i just looked it up it's a territory
thank

02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:45.030 --> 02:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.830 --> 02:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you that's it okay representative
 
02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:52.469 align:start position:0%
thank you that's it okay representative
weber

02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i was going to
 
02:22:55.359 --> 02:22:56.389 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i was going to
suggest

02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
02:23:00.030 --> 02:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
online 10 instead of saying
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
coordinated through if we perhaps used
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
the words
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
offered by because that
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
implies that it's coming from the va
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
um and i think it
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
might have a slightly stronger nexus
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh for the concerns that
 
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh were raised i think it was by
 
02:23:30.150 --> 02:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative woods but maybe it was by
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
02:23:36.790 --> 02:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
issue of the suspension of the laws
 
02:23:44.790 --> 02:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations having been
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
in the original language which we have
 
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
operated under for years and years and
 
02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:51.030 align:start position:0%
operated under for years and years and
years

02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
is is not so much of a concern to me but
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
having the qualifier in there is
 
02:23:58.080 --> 02:23:58.790 align:start position:0%
having the qualifier in there is
probably

02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
better practice because we want to make
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
sure we're saying what exactly
 
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
what we're giving guidance about but
 
02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
is vetted really
 
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
carefully with the practitioners from
 
02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
the va to ensure we're not restricting
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
something else that they actually need
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
so those are my kind yeah may i quickly
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
speak to that though that language
 
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
it was not there for a long time that
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
was put in under the emergency order
 
02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's 328 d2a
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
328 d2 was what was initially in there
 
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
and did not have the things about the
 
02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:35.349 align:start position:0%
and did not have the things about the
suspension

02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the the language about suspension all
 
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
had to do with the emergency order
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh because of covid so that's the thing
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about is it might have
 
02:24:45.429 --> 02:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
been some sloppy drafting
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
when it was put together uh back last
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
year clarification
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
as as i'm looking at this oh maybe
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
because i'm looking at the amendment let
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
me look at the original
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
um as i as i look at both the amendment
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the original bill it seems to be
 
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
indicating that the language on lines
 
02:25:07.429 --> 02:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
seven and eight were part of the
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
original statute
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
not yes but it's part of the original
 
02:25:15.030 --> 02:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
statute 328 d2a that was put in place by
 
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
executive order
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
emergency order put a statute in place
 
02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:19.830 align:start position:0%
emergency order put a statute in place
by

02:25:19.830 --> 02:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
executive order well then what is all
 
02:25:24.950 --> 02:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
this there's a statute or it's not
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
so i'll go and look it up and see what
 
02:25:28.469 --> 02:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
it says yeah take a look because it has
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
this large preamble of all the executive
 
02:25:30.399 --> 02:25:31.349 align:start position:0%
this large preamble of all the executive
orders

02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
um that led to it and they and it's why
 
02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's labeled d2a but
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that it's not by statute
 
02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
but somehow it got in
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
in response so i think that has only
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
been there it was effective june
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
14 2018 though so i'm i'm getting more
 
02:25:48.309 --> 02:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
confused as i say so i don't know the
 
02:25:48.319 --> 02:25:48.870 align:start position:0%
confused as i say so i don't know the
answer

02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative weber i'll look at the
 
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
underlying statute and we can discuss
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
more great thank you i'd appreciate that
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
i understand and i will run this
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
i'll run this final language by
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
representing weber and
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
obviously by mr laflamme uh to make sure
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
satisfying the va needs i've read all
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
the other stuff
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
by mr laflamme uh before representing
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
marsh and i put this together
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay what about the wording though when
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
i the wording that i put in to try to
 
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
solve this thorny thing about
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
out of state and all that stuff does are
 
02:26:29.270 --> 02:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
i have fewer words representative gay
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
for fewer words
 
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay line 17 in the amendment
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh well starting 16 may be supervised by
 
02:26:41.840 --> 02:26:43.270 align:start position:0%
uh well starting 16 may be supervised by
physicians

02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
skip from other states provided they
 
02:26:49.030 --> 02:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
just say but may be supervised by
 
02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:50.150 align:start position:0%
just say but may be supervised by
physicians

02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
who possess a current license in good
 
02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:53.590 align:start position:0%
who possess a current license in good
standing

02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
standing
 
02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
in their respective state or u.s
 
02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:00.790 align:start position:0%
in their respective state or u.s
territory

02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
and there's one other one other word
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
word change i'm suggesting
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
line 10 coordinate okay currently says
 
02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
line 10 coordinate okay currently says
coordinated

02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
coordinated
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
through the veterans administration
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
medical okay
 
02:27:16.349 --> 02:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
instead of coordinated how about
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
administered by
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
the va or provided by
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative kenner you ready for
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
another question or
 
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
well i i i think the question about con
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
coordinated through offered through
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
or whatever representative gay just came
 
02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
up with i i would that one i would not
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to defer to
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative weber who of who offered
 
02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
that phrase offered through as to what
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
makes the most legal since she is our
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
token uh lawyer on the on the
 
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
team we have uh lawyers as well at ols
 
02:28:43.190 --> 02:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah i know but i know this for the
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
first time
 
02:28:46.389 --> 02:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
they're not us okay um i'm going to
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
suggest we
 
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
move towards wrapping up what has become
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
a work session
 
02:28:53.510 --> 02:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
um and i'm going to call the people i
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
have on my list
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then close the hearing
 
02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
become work session awaiting good work
 
02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
and because the first bill we heard um
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
means we've got to come back then we'll
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
come back for this one as well
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
probably a couple of weeks um
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:16.710 --> 02:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
yes not wanting to be wrong i once again
 
02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
googled ms washington d.c and territory
 
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
and um it is clear that some people
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
think it is and some people think it
 
02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
think it is and some people think it
isn't

02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
02:29:28.389 --> 02:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
and so i would probably just bring that
 
02:29:30.230 --> 02:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
up with the people from
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
um ols and have that defer to them for
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
language that would be inclusive
 
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that i looked up
 
02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:44.790 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say that i looked up
section

02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
328 d colon 2a and
 
02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
when you look at it there's a huge chunk
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
of language referring to emergency
 
02:29:53.359 --> 02:29:54.710 align:start position:0%
of language referring to emergency
orders

02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
orders
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
but that's just telling you that you
 
02:29:58.230 --> 02:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
need to go and look at those emergency
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
orders and see what the emergency orders
 
02:30:00.319 --> 02:30:01.190 align:start position:0%
orders and see what the emergency orders
say

02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:30:03.429 --> 02:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
because they do in fact modify the
 
02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
existing language
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
but the existing language says new
 
02:30:09.270 --> 02:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire state licensure laws rules and
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
regulations are hereby suspended
 
02:30:16.070 --> 02:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it has said that since uh 2018 which
 
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
is when
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
the initial language was passed i still
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem clarifying it
 
02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:23.110 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem clarifying it
further

02:30:23.110 --> 02:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative folsom
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
oh well i was just um sorry i was
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
going off of what uh representative
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
weber said in representative gay
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
and the confusion over the coordinated
 
02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:40.630 align:start position:0%
and the confusion over the coordinated
truth

02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
truth
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
i would agree with weber and because
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
if you notice everywhere else like in
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
line 8
 
02:30:52.309 --> 02:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
and line 15 they use the word offering
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
and if we stick with the word offer i
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
think it it provides
 
02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
a continuity and a consistency
 
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative
 
02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:10.309 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative
merchants

02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%

my question was answered thank you thank
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
anything further uh i would suggest
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
individuals may call representative
 
02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:19.270 align:start position:0%
individuals may call representative

02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
about 26 lines so with that i am closing
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%

the anyway just a quick thing this room
 
02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
is reminiscent of our one hour on
 
02:31:46.790 --> 02:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
shell and may last year it was wonderful
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%

02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
finished on this
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh you can call representative canuck if
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
you wish your representative
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%

five retained bills
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
um at present we may wind up with
 
02:32:17.790 --> 02:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
another one but right now we have five
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
103. um uh you may wish to write the
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
numbers down
 
02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
so you can look them up 103 an act
 
02:32:26.309 --> 02:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
establishing a dental
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%

alternatives to opioids that number
again

02:32:44.469 --> 02:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:32:55.270 --> 02:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%

02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
in house bill 604 an act expanding the
 
02:33:34.790 --> 02:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire vaccine association
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
to include adult vaccines we have these
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
i know i still have the list of people
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
who wish to be
 
02:33:51.750 --> 02:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
on mental health bills versus
 
02:33:55.510 --> 02:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
other bills but if anyone was
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
interested in saying you would like to
 
02:33:59.830 --> 02:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
be on any of these
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'll accept those emails and
 
02:34:04.870 --> 02:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
try to jiggle together some work
 
02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:06.650 align:start position:0%
try to jiggle together some work
sessions

02:34:06.650 --> 02:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:08.230 align:start position:0%
sessions
[Music]

02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
a couple of months from now i also want
 
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
to point out
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
and actually a couple of committee
 
02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
chairs have
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
pointed this out to me under
 
02:34:21.429 --> 02:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
gosh you guys sure do have a lot on
 
02:34:21.439 --> 02:34:22.150 align:start position:0%
gosh you guys sure do have a lot on
consent

02:34:22.150 --> 02:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
consent
 
02:34:27.270 --> 02:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
or 19 to 2. and i think that is because
 
02:34:31.190 --> 02:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the procedure that just sort of
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
evolved into existence of
 
02:34:36.469 --> 02:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
a republican grabbing a democrat after a
 
02:34:36.479 --> 02:34:37.349 align:start position:0%
a republican grabbing a democrat after a
hearing

02:34:37.349 --> 02:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
and saying you know i think we can bring
 
02:34:42.550 --> 02:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
together good points you have and good
 
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
points we have and
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
have something that isn't maybe a
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
compromise but maybe more
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensively good
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
and you brought that amendment to an
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
exact session and
 
02:34:57.270 --> 02:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
all of this or most of us agreed
 
02:34:59.910 --> 02:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that's why it's that process
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
on these um retain bills when there'll
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
be work sessions on them
 
02:35:08.309 --> 02:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
and on the two bills we looked at today
 
02:35:11.429 --> 02:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
senate bill 45 and senate bill 120.
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
um i i think this is um at the risk of
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
being a poli-sci
 
02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
professor this is
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
a lesson in how we get things done
 
02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
i certainly have some non-negotiables i
 
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
have ideology
 
02:35:30.389 --> 02:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
i have certain moral tenants
 
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll stick to them
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
but most of the bills we have are not
 
02:35:38.950 --> 02:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
that or not that to a great
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
degree or to a degree where my views and
 
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
the views of others
 
02:35:47.750 --> 02:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
can be accommodated if we work for it
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
and the idea of let's work towards that
 
02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:51.990 align:start position:0%
and the idea of let's work towards that
means

02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:35:54.309 --> 02:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
as teddy roosevelt said the hero is the
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
one who makes mistakes but is engaged in
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
the process
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
and not sits on the sideline so as we go
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
forward i'd love to see more bills
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
as many as possible knowing there's a
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
few that will not be this the more
 
02:36:10.870 --> 02:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
that we can come out with a happy
 
02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:12.070 align:start position:0%
that we can come out with a happy
agreement

02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
the better i think we've enjoyed that
 
02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
um and i think that's something that we
 
02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:18.550 align:start position:0%
um and i think that's something that we
can

02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:36:21.750 --> 02:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
more intentionally work towards
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
so i'll be uh happy to receive
 
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
your uh suggestions as to which
 
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
of these bills work sessions you'd be
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
like to
 
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
like to be on and i'll let you know but
 
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
don't expect it for a couple of months
 
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
part of that is we have to wait to make
 
02:36:41.270 --> 02:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
sure there's enough technical
 
02:36:44.790 --> 02:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
staff available because work sessions
 
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
are public events now
 
02:36:50.389 --> 02:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
how many people what's that how many
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
people do you want to put on these i
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
don't know yet
 
02:36:55.349 --> 02:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
don't know yet i mean if you only have a
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
few you don't get all the
 
02:37:01.030 --> 02:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
possible points if you have too many it
 
02:37:03.270 --> 02:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
becomes unwieldy don't know yet
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
less than half but still now
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much one other question
 
02:37:12.309 --> 02:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
is i don't think i have the most recent
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to 120.
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
do we have any printed copies of the one
 
02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
we was actually working on
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
the one we were working off um part of
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
the time was 1107.
 
02:37:25.389 --> 02:37:25.399 align:start position:0%
that's not the one i had okay there's
 
02:37:25.399 --> 02:37:27.110 align:start position:0%
that's not the one i had okay there's
1107.

02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
1107.
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
and uh that that's right with the other
 
02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
one that i sent out was just something i
 
02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
was doing as a little work product as we
 
02:37:35.349 --> 02:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
were working so people could see it in
 
02:37:35.359 --> 02:37:35.990 align:start position:0%
were working so people could see it in
writing

02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
writing
 
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
so can i send it in the email to our
 
02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
so can i send it in the email to our
committee

02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:37:41.510 --> 02:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
but don't worry it's not an official
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
amendment yet that's what we'll work on
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and now the the bill
 
02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns i have is a bill
 
02:37:52.630 --> 02:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
that we passed in the last session
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
it was a very brief bill it was two
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
paragraphs long
 
02:37:58.710 --> 02:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
it was very simple bill it simply looked
 
02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
at medicaid in and out
 
02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
which is a service that's provided to
 
02:38:06.710 --> 02:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
individuals whose income is too high
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
to qualify for medicaid but they have
 
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing medical expenses that are so
 
02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
high that they couldn't possibly
 
02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
meet those obligations with their income
 
02:38:18.550 --> 02:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
so it's simply there's a law that was
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
passed 30 years ago that said
 
02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
if that income is if they spend down
 
02:38:26.070 --> 02:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
to what was determined to be the poverty
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
level all
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
medical expenses beyond that are going
 
02:38:31.590 --> 02:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
to be covered by medicaid
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's you have to do that each month
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
and so forth but it does work
 
02:38:39.030 --> 02:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
however as you probably aware the cost
 
02:38:40.630 --> 02:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
of living has gone up somewhat in the
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
last 30 years
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
so what we did was we tried to modify
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
what that
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
base was going to be that the spend down
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
had to come down to before they
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
qualified and that passed this committee
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
i think it was
 
02:38:57.510 --> 02:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
20 to nothing and past the senate
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
senator sherman was very involved in
 
02:39:01.590 --> 02:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
that i was like is he still on
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
oh okay see part of what i was doing as
 
02:39:08.389 --> 02:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
long as we had him
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
as a captive audience i was going to
 
02:39:12.389 --> 02:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
check because i've got to call him about
 
02:39:12.399 --> 02:39:14.389 align:start position:0%
check because i've got to call him about
this

02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
and it was signed by the governor now it
 
02:39:19.070 --> 02:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
got confusing because house bill
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
1639 was the number
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
it was two paragraphs long when i wrote
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
it when it was finally passed in the
 
02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
house the title was changed from
 
02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:28.550 align:start position:0%
house the title was changed from
medicaid

02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:39:31.349 --> 02:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
and out to health care to health care
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
concerns or something like that
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
and it became 39 pages and it was
 
02:39:38.550 --> 02:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
what was euphemistically called a
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
christmas tree bill
 
02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
remember because of all the
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
complications going on in this
 
02:39:45.270 --> 02:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
in the senate but it did pass was signed
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
by the governor
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
and currently the department of health
 
02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
and human services is under an
 
02:39:51.270 --> 02:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
obligation to meet these new guidelines
 
02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
because we
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
passed that law and it was signed into
 
02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:54.950 align:start position:0%
passed that law and it was signed into
law

02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the governor did not
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
include any funds
 
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
to increase the money that was available
 
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the minute and uh when i spoke with
 
02:40:09.510 --> 02:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards oh i didn't
 
02:40:10.469 --> 02:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
speak personally
 
02:40:12.389 --> 02:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
but when they made the report i asked
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
the question and they included any money
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
to fund that
 
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
he didn't seem to be aware that that was
 
02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
something that needed to be done so it
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
was not included
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
in division three's budget
 
02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
so um influenced the senate
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
to cooperate some number what that
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
number is is a
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
mystery to me it's very confusing
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't know who's going to
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
qualify to go in we'll no longer have to
 
02:40:40.240 --> 02:40:41.429 align:start position:0%
qualify to go in we'll no longer have to
do

02:40:41.429 --> 02:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:40:44.070 --> 02:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know but some people now will fall
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
under the new
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
guideline and they'll go into the
 
02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
regular managed care campground
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
and others so it's you know the
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
the uh the fiscal note was an absolute
 
02:40:54.479 --> 02:40:55.349 align:start position:0%
the uh the fiscal note was an absolute
nightmare

02:40:55.349 --> 02:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
nightmare
 
02:40:57.349 --> 02:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
and department didn't really know how to
 
02:40:59.429 --> 02:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
figure out what it was going to be
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
i've made some calls and got a call back
 
02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday and then able to take it
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
another zoom call but uh tim
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
timothy is tim lippman the head of
 
02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:11.750 align:start position:0%
timothy is tim lippman the head of
medicaid

02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
i asked if he could be of any assistance
 
02:41:15.269 --> 02:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
to us to try to figure out i said
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
we need some kind of a number to at
 
02:41:18.870 --> 02:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
least be included
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
in house bill in the budget
 
02:41:25.830 --> 02:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
either hospital too
 
02:41:27.269 --> 02:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
so that this doesn't get off the ground
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
because as you know there were a number
 
02:41:29.590 --> 02:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
of cuts
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
to the department of health and human
 
02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
services they lost a number of positions
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
so they don't have a lot of flexibility
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
to suddenly stop funding this at an
 
02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
additional level
 
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
especially if we don't have any idea
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for so
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call senator sherman and
 
02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.110 align:start position:0%
i'm going to call senator sherman and
senator

02:41:47.110 --> 02:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh roosevelt uh who are both on the
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
health committee
 
02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i think of any of the others of you
 
02:41:55.269 --> 02:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
this was a bill that was very important
 
02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
to this committee
 
02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
i think and it makes common sense i mean
 
02:41:59.120 --> 02:41:59.429 align:start position:0%
i think and it makes common sense i mean
this

02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
isn't this affects a lot of people with
 
02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
mental illness but it also affects
 
02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:03.910 align:start position:0%
mental illness but it also affects
people

02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
who are on dialysis or have other
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing medical expenses
 
02:42:11.110 --> 02:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
it can be pretty overwhelming so i think
 
02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty important bill and i hope
 
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
that whatever we can do
 
02:42:17.590 --> 02:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
just to say sorry it was an oversight
 
02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
this was never included in the budget we
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
need to find a way
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
to now include something from the budget
 
02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
so they uh
 
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
because they are obligated to know me
 
02:42:27.510 --> 02:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
it's been signed into law you can't
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
senator snow you've picked a tremendous
 
02:42:35.349 --> 02:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
time to find
 
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
the unmute this is great
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
i i hope that you will keep us all in
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:42:46.550 --> 02:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
looped in as to when you talk to mr
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
lippman and so on and so forth
 
02:42:50.550 --> 02:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
because i think this um there may be
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
time to talk
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
to the senate in terms of their budget
 
02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
now that we sent it to them
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
and senator geider who was here before
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
um on that budget thing so
 
02:43:07.110 --> 02:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
he'd like to know i'm sure our alumni on
 
02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the senate uh rep senator sherman and
 
02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:11.429 align:start position:0%
in the senate uh rep senator sherman and
rosenwald

02:43:11.429 --> 02:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
rosenwald
 
02:43:13.990 --> 02:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sure would be very interested so you
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
send us what
 
02:43:16.950 --> 02:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
we need to know and you make suggestions
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
on how we can help
 
02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
what i was really hoping for today is
 
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
that he'd still be on so
 
02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
he's trying to get through it these guys
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
right now on the phone
 
02:43:28.630 --> 02:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
and you know i don't know about you i
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
don't know if you get as many emails as
 
02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
i did
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm certainly sending an email you
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
kind of wonder
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
i'm texting yeah i would too thank you
 
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
so much for that
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that was not an official i
 
02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
just dropped this letter
 
02:43:52.230 --> 02:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
sorry i i think that the the the ending
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
remarks took care of what i was gonna
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
say i mean the
 
02:44:01.510 --> 02:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
the only thing that need that can help
 
02:44:04.710 --> 02:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
particularly right now is getting in
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
touch with the senators
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
on the finance committee in the senate
 
02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:09.510 align:start position:0%
on the finance committee in the senate
uh

02:44:09.510 --> 02:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
immediately if not sooner and and making
 
02:44:14.309 --> 02:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
sure they're aware because the
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
department is under an obligation to
 
02:44:18.070 --> 02:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
fund it whether it's in the budget
 
02:44:20.389 --> 02:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
or not and if they're under an
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund it then that means
 
02:44:24.150 --> 02:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
more funds have to come from somewhere
 
02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
else uh and i'm also
 
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
going to apologize to the committee for
 
02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:29.349 align:start position:0%
going to apologize to the committee for
having

02:44:29.349 --> 02:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
having
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
been so slow at muting and unmuting i
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
made a terrible experiment last night
 
02:44:40.469 --> 02:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
in that i decided to try
 
02:44:43.030 --> 02:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh glue on fingernails for the first
 
02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:45.190 align:start position:0%
uh glue on fingernails for the first
time

02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
by 68 years and i am here to tell you
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
that i have glued my own fingernails to
 
02:44:51.359 --> 02:44:51.750 align:start position:0%
that i have glued my own fingernails to
my

02:44:51.750 --> 02:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
skin and in at least one
 
02:44:57.030 --> 02:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
case i have glued not one but two
 
02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
fingernails on top of my own fingernails
 
02:45:02.309 --> 02:45:02.319 align:start position:0%
and i should perhaps have read the
 
02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
instructions because
 
02:45:05.910 --> 02:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
i gather i'm now going to have to just
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
wait for the uh
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
glue to loosen of its own accord
 
02:45:14.790 --> 02:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
i can't actually
 
02:45:18.150 --> 02:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
operate in in in the ways that i used to
 
02:45:19.830 --> 02:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
and i know people can do it because i've
 
02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
seen them do it so i need to adapt but
 
02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative webber i have two
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
responses to that number one i know a
