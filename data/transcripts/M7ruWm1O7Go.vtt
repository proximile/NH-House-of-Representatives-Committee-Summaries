um I'm just going to go into my
 
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
testimony just because um it's a little
 
00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
lengthy and um so giving people the
 
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
option to vote on amending the New
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution to explicitly
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
state that in all cases and suits of the
 
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
State against one of the people the
 
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
defendant shall be innocent until proven
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
guilty is important for several reasons
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
it strengthenings due Pro it strengthens
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
due process while the presumption of
 
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
innocent is already a fundamental
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
principle in American law explicitly
 
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
adding it to the state constitution
 
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
reinforces the commitment to protect
 
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
individuals from wrongful convictions
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
and unjust government actions preventing
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
government overreach by enshrining this
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
principle the amendment ensures that the
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
state always carries the burden of proof
 
00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 align:start position:0%
preventing potential abuses where
 
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
individuals might be presumed guilty
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
without sufficient evidence clarifying
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
legal standards some legal procceed
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
proceedings such as civil asset
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
forfeiture or certain regulatory
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
violations may not afford defendants the
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
same presumption of innocence as
 
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
criminal cases this amendment could help
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
ensure broader application of this
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
principle empowering voters giving
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
people the opportunity to vote on this
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
issue promotes the Democratic process
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
and participation and allows citizens to
 
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
directly influence how Justice it is
 
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
administered in their state five setting
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
a precedent for other states if pass
 
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment could encourage other
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
states to take similar steps reinforcing
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections Nationwide
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
the principle of innocent until proven
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
guilty unless proven guilty is already a
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of the US legal system
 
00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
primarily recognized in criminal law
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
however adding this explicitly to the
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution would
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
strengthen its application in a few ways
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
current US in New Hampshire legal
 
00:06:56.869 --> 00:06:56.879 align:start position:0%
standards the fifth and 14th amendments
 
00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 align:start position:0%
of the US Constitution provide due
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
process rights and ensuring that no
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
person is deprived of life liberty or
 
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
property without legal procedures the
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
presumption of innocence is a is a
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
principle recognized in US courts
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
primarily based on precedent rather than
 
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
an explicit constitutional
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
provision the New Hampshire Constitution
 
00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
part one Bill of Rights already includes
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
protection related to due process and
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
legal fairness but this amendment would
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
make the presumption of innocence
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly clear in all state actions
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
against individual
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
why this amendment matters it closes
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
legal gaps while criminal cases follow
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
the presumption of innocence some
 
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 align:start position:0%
administrative and civil actions by the
 
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
state may place the burden on
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
individuals to prove their innocence
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment could reinforce fairness
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
in such
 
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
cases as I already talked about in
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
limiting potential government overreach
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
without this explicit language further
 
00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:54.919 align:start position:0%
legislation or judicial rulings might
 
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
shift the burden unfairly in certain C
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
situations such as regulatory violation
 
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
or forfeit cases and it prevents legal
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
erosion codifying the presumption of
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
innocence in the state constitution
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
ensures that it remains a fundamental
 
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
right regardless of political or legal
 
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
shifts at the federal level so in
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
comparison with other states and some
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
historical examples while um the
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
presumption of innocence is
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
wellestablished principle in US criminal
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
law it's not explicitly stated in the US
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
Constitution instead it comes from case
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
law particularly in 1895 a Supreme Court
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
decision coffen versus United States
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
which affirmed that defendants must be
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
presumed innocent until proven guilty
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt some states
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
have taken steps to reinforce or expand
 
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
this principle through Constitutional
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
Amendments or legal reforms Louisiana in
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
2018 they voted to overturn a law that
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
allowed um non-un unanimous jury
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
verdicts and felony trials reinforcing
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
the idea that defendants should have
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
full protections under the law Texas and
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
Michigan they have constitutional
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
language that protects due process but
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't explicitly State a universal
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
presumption of
 
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
innocence um historical cases where this
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
principle was challenged uh civil asses
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
for forfeiture Nationwide in many cases
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can seize property
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
suspected of being connected to a crime
 
00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
without requiring a criminal conviction
 
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
critics argue that this flips the burden
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
onto individuals to prove their
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
innocence a constitutional amendment in
 
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could make such practices
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
more difficult interment of the Japanese
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
Americans in World War II that's katsu
 
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
versus the US the US government detained
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
thousands of Japanese Americans without
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
individual trials violating due process
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
if stronger constitutional Pro
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
protections had been in place such
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
actions could have been legally
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
challenged more effectively post 911
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
detentions case of indefinite detention
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
such as those under the US Patriot Act
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
raise concerns about presumption of
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
innocence being bypassed in National
 
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
Security cases
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
cases so how could we set a precedent if
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
passed this amendment would make New
 
00:10:12.509 --> 00:10:12.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the first states to
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
explicitly enslin this protection in our
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
constitution other states may follow uh
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
leading to National conversation about
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
reinforcing legal protections Beyond
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
just criminal trials and it could be
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
used in legal challenges where the
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
government places an unfair burden on
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
individuals in civil or administrative
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
matters I'd like to um make reference to
 
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959 align:start position:0%
three uh three amendments to the New
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution uh part one
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
Article 2 in natural rights it was

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh part um part one article 2A the
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
bearing of arms was added in December
 
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:00.120 align:start position:0%

themselves their families their property
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
in the state and one of I think the most
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
important one that was added recently
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
was part one article 2B the right of
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
natural essential and
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
inherent as you hopefully read in
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
honorable Dan it says testimony our
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
constitution is very clear in criminal
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
during the late 20th century Child
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
Protection was moved out of criminal
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
court and into a civil court then in
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
1995 a dedicated equity Court civil
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
court for this purpose was instituted
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
this is where everything went wrong the
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
common law foundational law maximums are
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
nowhere to be found in our family court
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
system these maximums of common law were
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
intended to protect individuals against
 
00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:16.310 align:start position:0%

overwhelming overwhelmingly power of the
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
state um are suspended and they're
 
00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
basically suspended in Family Court the
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%

00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
ignored or flat out refused by the
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
courts there is no greater Liberty issue
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
than of your own life or your children's
 
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:10.519 align:start position:0%
lives we need to put this element of
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
common law reserved for the people into
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
our constitution so it is beyond
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
legislative meddling our only job as
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives is to protect the rights
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
of the people we took an oath to both
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire and US constitutions
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
to do so we work for the people and only
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
for them them many in the legislature
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
have forgotten that this is our only job
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
here so my question to all of you is
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
this do you believe that people Accused
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
by the state in criminal or civil court
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
are innocent until proven guilty if the
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is yes please
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
pass this in your committee if the
 
00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is no are you
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
willing to tell the people of New
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the state can accuse them
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
and they will need to prove their
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
innocence rather than the state proving
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
their guilt we learned a lot from the
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
recent Supreme Court decision it was the
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
bruan decision that came out in June of
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
2022 Bruin marks a return to the general
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
law approach common foundational law
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
under which courts look quote to history
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
and custom to understand the right for
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
example under this view legislates could
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
not create sensitive places that
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
effectively deny people their
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to bear arms out
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
the home the historical litmus test is
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
important in this issue and we've seen
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
the courts move in that direction for
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
the last two to three years I thank you
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm welcome to take
 
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.030 align:start position:0%
for your time and I'm welcome to take
any

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness yes
 
00:14:45.279 --> 00:14:47.269 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness yes
representative

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
Oregon yes thank you very much uh Mr
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much representative
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
on the one hand this amendment is very
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
timely given you know what's going on
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
Nationwide some pretty dramatic stuff
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand we're year early
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
because we can't vote on it until
 
00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:02.839 align:start position:0%
November 26
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
and and um I also don't so that mean
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
that so are you intending for us maybe
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
to take some time to think about exactly
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
how to word it like for example I'm not
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
quite sure what this phrase one of the
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
people means so um so can maybe
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
elucidate uh like what one of the people
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
thanks um throughout throughout both
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
constitutions it talks about um it talks
 
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
about the people versus um and natural
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
rights of the people versus um the
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
government so I think that's what um um
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
basically the Constitution is written
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
for the people and for their rights um
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
to protect of course government
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
encroachment I do know that this falls
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
under voting in 26 and uh I'm just
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
getting a jump on
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
it thanks other questions for this
 
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.150 align:start position:0%
it thanks other questions for this
Witness

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none I I guess I have a couple of
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
questions um the the first question I
 
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
have is
 
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.389 align:start position:0%
have is
um

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
you can you give us any ex you you say
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
for example if I'm understanding
 
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
correctly that in the family courts in
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
child abuse cases the courts are PL am I
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that you're saying the
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
courts are placing the burden on the
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
person who's accused of of having
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
committed some kind of abuse to
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
establish that they're innocent it's not
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
just in abuse cases it could be in in
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
custody cases and things like that so
 
00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
yes and that is definitely happening and
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
I can give you multitudes of examples so
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
here's my here's my question I'm just
 
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
you know I when I heard that of this
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
amendment coming up I went did a little
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
research and I'm looking now at the
 
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect statute and I refer to
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
RSA 169 C13 which says the petitioner
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
that is the state or whoever is filing
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
to you know to to say that the child has
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
been abused has the burden to prove the
 
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
allegations in support of the petition
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
by a preponderance of the evidence so I
 
00:17:16.029 --> 00:17:16.039 align:start position:0%
guess I'm what I'm really not clear on
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
is if you're saying that courts are not
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
following the current law which very
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
clearly says that the burden is on the
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
state I guess my question is how is this
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
going to help if we pass a
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment why won't they
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
too it's just one step in the many and I
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
think that um hopefully uh with the
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
historical content of of how things are
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
um being used now that this could be
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
referred to um going up to a higher
 
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
court level maybe even out of our own um
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
Court Juris that we can use this um in a
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
in a federal manner um there's there has
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
been unbelievable amounts of evidence
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
that's refused I'm working with a
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
constituent right now and every single
 
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
thing he just had another hearing was
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
ignored the judge decided he wasn't
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
going to look at any of it none of it he
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't seen his children in almost a
 
00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
year and there's nothing there's no
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
restraining order there's nothing
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
against him it doesn't make any sense so
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
can I just ask you and you the
 
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:26.200 align:start position:0%
information that you're just that you've
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
just relayed to us about this case this
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know constituent or whatever um were
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
did you talk to the other side of the
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
case in other words do you you've got if
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding correctly you've
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
gotten the perspective of one side of
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
the case and it sounds like from what
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
you're saying presumably the the side
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
that didn't Prevail so my question
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
is you are you how are you able to make
 
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
an accurate assessment of whether that's
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
true if you haven't talked to the other
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
side of the case you haven't heard what
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
the other side had to say this isn't
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
about me taking sides this is about
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
literally not using the evidence at hand
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
it being ignored that's the reason my
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
question is how do you know that it was
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
ignored I I've read the court
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
transcripts I was there and I was there
 
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
at the court hearing okay and so the I
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
watched it firsthand so you are so and
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
and so and did the judge give a reason
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
for why he was not or she was not uh
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
hearing the evidence no she did not okay
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
all right and you say that this is
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
something that has happened routinely
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
multitudes of times okay all right and I
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
will give you whatever you need I will
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
of that information for you yeah I I
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it if you could get you
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
say you've looked at the transcript I
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
would appreciate I'd like to see the
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
transcript if you wouldn't mind

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.510 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
um right so let me ask you we have we
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
have about five minutes um I'd like to
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
um while we have that time turn to um
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
and open an executive session on House
 
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.390 align:start position:0%
and open an executive session on House
Bill

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:54.039 align:start position:0%
480 that was the bill that um we heard
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
last week by repes was representative
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
Pearson testifying it's the bill
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
um that would establish um uh the
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
um oh what is the name of it the the it
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
was it establishes a procedure for uh
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
restoring competency and it calls for
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
the uh pilot
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
program uh to establish in either marac
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
or or straford County to establish a
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
forensic liaison position to assist in
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
restoring competence idency
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I think when we had um a a brief
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
discussion about it last week um
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh Pell had a question
 
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
about you know wanted to sort of look at
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
it a little bit further um I think she's
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
now had that as I understand it had the
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
chance to do that so it seemed like we
 
00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
were all generally in agreement on this
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
um with the with the exception of the
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
concerns representative pedal had and I
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding and I'll let her speak
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
for herself is she has satisfied her
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
concerns and is now okay with it um so
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
if we are all generally in consensus I
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
would propose to exact the bill and take
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
a vote on it now is there anybody that
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
has a problem with doing that I have no
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
problem at all we do have a quum my only
 
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:21.799 align:start position:0%
question is since there're only 11 of us
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
um do you think that it is a right
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
assuming Jo's bad
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
um it would be better to have more
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
people here and I'm not I'm not
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
prejudging the answer I'm just raising
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
the question no I I hear what you're
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
saying I guess my sense is that you know
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
we when we did have more some people who
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
are not here today my recollection is
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
nobody had any any issues so I agree
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
with that and for example representative
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
tur who was not here here because he's
 
00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
at another important legislative related
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
meeting um was actually on the that's
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
right he was on this that's right and
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
isn't is a sponsor of the bill and I
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
believe repres actually I believe
 
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative kutab was if if she was
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
not she was either on the committee or
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
certainly is is very spor to intimately
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with it so I don't think so and
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
given those to go ahead I don't see any
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
of my colleagues expressing any concern
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
I do want to mention that we have
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
received um an email um from um the
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities rights center right saying
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
that they felt that they had not been
 
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.830 align:start position:0%
that they felt that they had not been
included

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
um and I I read it and I understand what
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
they said
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not sure that other than
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
recognizing their absolute right to have
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
expressed their concern about that that
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
um affected the outcome now that that
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
that was my sense too but representative
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
Rao representative Smith covered what I
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
wanted I just wanted to mention the
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
email we had all receiv I saw I saw that
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
also and I you know I didn't know if
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
there were any concerns about that or
 
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
right yeah I me just it seemed to me I
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
mean it
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
it you know I I obviously I was not a
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
member of that sub but I it it really
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
did seem to me both from my from
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson's testimony and
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
just discussions that I've had um with
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh kab um that you
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
know that there was very representative
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
Pearson Tred to get the broadest
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
possible input from various factors
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
various uh places and it seemed like you
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
know he achieved that so um unless
 
00:25:57.789 --> 00:25:57.799 align:start position:0%
anybody has any strong objection I would
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
propose yes representative Andrew thank
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I have a strong
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
objection in executive session normally
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
when we advertise it we make sure we
 
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
have 20 people here and today we have
 
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.430 align:start position:0%
have 20 people here and today we have
eight

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
missing and they they may all be in
 
00:26:18.909 --> 00:26:18.919 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill but I just don't think
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's fair to exact a bill with so many
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
of us missing and if we're going to
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
exact bills then maybe we need to fill
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
the chairs with the you know appro
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
substitutes that's just my opinion okay
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
um well does anybody else have that if
 
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
anybody yes representative ber thank you
 
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have a very broad question
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm not exactly sure who to ask but
 
00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
at this point in time if a bill like
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
this and I'm not sure what your thought
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
methodology is but when a bill like this
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
happens and all of a sudden it takes
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
like everybody starts reading about it
 
00:26:56.669 --> 00:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
and what if it becomes this big deal I
 
00:26:58.750 --> 00:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
mean does legal look at these so it's
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay or we're
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
legal cuz I know on other places I've
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
been it's like we do our thing and then
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
pass it to legal to make sure it's
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
worded correctly or whatnot so we can't
 
00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
get in trouble but I was just confusing
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I was just curious if that's
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
part of the procedure is having I know
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
we don't have attorneys kicking around
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
but no go go ahead represent I'll I'll
 
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.070 align:start position:0%
but no go go ahead represent I'll I'll
let

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
let
 
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
you good question um
 
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature makes the
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
law and um there are times when the
 
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.149 align:start position:0%
law and um there are times when the
legislature

00:27:37.149 --> 00:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
isn't 100%
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable and although I don't agree
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
with this they then go through what I
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
refer to as Mommy mayi and that is to
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
ask the Supreme Court for a decision as
 
00:27:57.149 --> 00:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
to whether X Y or Z is appropriate other
 
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh so and and we you know when the the
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
bills are drafted you know there are all
 
00:28:11.509 --> 00:28:11.519 align:start position:0%
kinds of people
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
Whose advice is sought but um so it's a
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
little different from another
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
environment I appreciate it all right so
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
let me um ask if if um representative
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
Andrew has has expressed some concern
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
about doing this if if if that would
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
lead representative Andrew to vote no
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
that would be a a 10 to one vote which
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
would still be sufficient you can vote I
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
just want yeah no no I hear you I you
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
know I guess what I would say
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew is this I would
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
not I would not do this if we had not
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
discussed this last week and the people
 
00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
who are missing did not express any
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
objection to proceeding but it seems to
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
me given that they didn't and that the
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
only person who had a concern and
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
perfectly legitimate concern
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative predel has now studied
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
the bill and and you know her concerns
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
are resolved I think there really is an
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
interest in proceeding and I I guess you
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
know one of the things I that that I
 
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
think is really important to emphasize
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
is I think not only today uh but you
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
know going forward with the rest of the
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
days of hearings it will be really
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
important for this committee to try to
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
exec as many bills as you can exec um
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
you know as quickly as possible
 
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
because in early March we're going to
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
have a lot of work to do and to the
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
extent we can you know remove bills uh
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
early I think it is in everybody's
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
interest to do that representative
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
peder thank you Mr chairman I just
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to um speak for myself that yes I
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
have had an opportunity to review this
 
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
amendment and um in support of it
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
however I'm looking in my um Bill file
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
and I noticed that we don't have a
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
member of the committee
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
whose name is on this amendment so we
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
would need to have that I believe before
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
we can actually introduce and vote on it
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
is representative
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
Pearson's no
 
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
off Comm off all right so I guess I I
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
would propose to go for to go ahead with
 
00:30:22.909 --> 00:30:22.919 align:start position:0%
the exec on this bill and so first um I
 
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640 align:start position:0%

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
carries um since I was up early this
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
morning and actually have the report
 
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
written I'll write I'll write the I'll
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
write the report you made the motion
 
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
right you were going to ask me to other
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
no no
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
no um all
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
right no not consent is there um
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew says no to consent
 
00:33:12.029 --> 00:33:12.039 align:start position:0%
no all right so it will not I don't know
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
that it it would go on consent anyway
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
because it it is even though it's not a
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
money Bill now it is gonna clearly go to
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
finance so I think we we're better off
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
not having it on consent anyway um uh
 
00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew uh do you plan to
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
write a Minority Report no okay all
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
good all right good well thank you I'm
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
glad we at least got that out of the way
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I know representative Pearson will
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
be happy about that also all right um
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
next we're on to uh chter 10 and I'm

666 FN relative to adding uh restitution
 
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
payments for violations of the
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of the library use
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
records and uh adding library cards and
 
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
membership status to the list of
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
confidential matters and I recognize
 
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.589 align:start position:0%
confidential matters and I recognize
representative

00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
members of the committee good morning
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Lisa merer
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro District 44 gtown
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
and where I'm going to start by saying
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
don't hold the bill number 666 against
 
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:40.599 align:start position:0%
me I did not ask for
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
that um I could not change it
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
so all right so first of all thank you
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
for passing HB 376 on consent last week
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
that was a big privacy win for present
 
00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
and future Library users not only in go
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
down but throughout our entire state so
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
that bill this is part two of that bill
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
so that bill addressed expanding 91a
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
colon 5 to clarify that library cards
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
and Library membership statuses are
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
exempt from right to no requests this
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
bill addresses RSA 2011 dco and 11 which
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
pertains to the confidentiality of
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
Library user records currently the RSA
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
language reads and I quote
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
Library records which contain the names
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
or other personal identifying
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
information regarding the users of
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
public or other than public libraries
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
shall be con shall be confidential and
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
shall not be disclosed such records
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
include but are not limited to library
 
00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:52.119 align:start position:0%
information system and archival Records
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
related to the circulation and use of
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
Library materials or services including
 
00:35:59.190 --> 00:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
record of materials that have been
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
viewed or stored in electronic form end
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
quote again it appears the current law
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
is pretty straightforward in keeping
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
library cards confidential but our town
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
apparently did not think so so this
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
further clarifies
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill copies the exact same
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
verbiage as 91a colon 5 to read such
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
records include but are not limited to
 
00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
library cards and Library membership
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
status etc for
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
consistency this bill also adds a
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
restitution payment as a penalty for
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
violations of disclosing this private
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
information adding restitution as a
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
remedy ensures that individuals harmed
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
by such breaches have a clear Avenue for
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
relief which the people in our town did
 
00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
not Financial penalties also serve as a
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
deterrent a deterrent rein en forcing
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
the seriousness of protecting Library
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
users libraries are cornerstones of
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
intellectual freedom and privacy patrons
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
must feel confident that their reading
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
habits research inquiries and membership
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
status remain confidential the current
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
law provides some protection but
 
00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
additional measures are needed to deter
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
violations and address harm when
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
breaches occur which the current law
 
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
does not by extending confidentiality
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
protections to these aspects we align
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
PRI Library privacy standards with
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
broader protections for p personally
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
identifiable information I urge this
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee to adopt these enhancements to
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
safeguard the privacy and trust that are
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
fundamental to the role of libraries in
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
our communities thank you for your
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
consideration and I welcome any
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness yes
 
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo thank you Mr
 
00:37:53.069 --> 00:37:53.079 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
question um for the uh restitution the
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
Fe the new paragraph um is there any
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
intentionality or um knowing uh sort of
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
or did you contemplate that kind of
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
language in terms of this was actually
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
done through the our drafting attorney
 
00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
and and so he went through the proper
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
recourse to decide to figure out an
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
amount that would be uh not not a
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
financial liability to people but also
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned a deterrent yeah so I'm
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't think I asked the question
 
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
very clearly um if there was an
 
00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:32.910 align:start position:0%
very clearly um if there was an
unintentional

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure how does that work with the
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
restitution thing I'm not sure what you
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
me is it a penalty in terms of like a
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
knowing disclosure as opposed to someone
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
accidentally disclosing are they still
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
liable for the how would you
 
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
accidentally disclose a library
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
card I mean I
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
can I'm just spitballing here but like
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
some sort of data breach some sort of
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
something some sort of recordkeeping
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
error and an off office or I I'm just I
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
think there's scenario as I could
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
imagine so I just so a data breach a g
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
gdpr breach I believe is a whole
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
different situation this is someone
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
intentionally filing a right to know to
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
request and and publish someone's
 
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
personal private information and in our
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
in the case in our town it was they were
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
weaponizing library because it's it's
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
part two of falling under the right to
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
know umbrella okay exactly okay I
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yeah then the other
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
other question oh sorry I can't do that
 
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
I can't do that sorry you have another
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
question I do have one it's just it's
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
very narrow you don't mind thank you
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
where you cross out or we otherwise U
 
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
required by Statute can you tell me
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
about striking out that yes so there's
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
there's other places in statute where um
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
you can library cards can be released
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
via court order or if someone's under
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
investigation so that's that's another
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
area of Statute so this this would say
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
that like if if that pertained then this
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply so you can you can ask you
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
can get someone's library card uh you
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
know someone can come in if they're if
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
they have something going on them that
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
the law needs that information yes y
 
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.589 align:start position:0%
the law needs that information yes y
representative

00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
Smith I'm sorry representative ber on
 
00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:20.990 align:start position:0%
Smith I'm sorry representative ber on
next

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
no thank you for being here and your
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
sense of humor I just wanted to know as
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
far as like education for example we
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
have so many school you know with
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
schools does any of that apply to the
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
kind of privacy that students like in in
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
their school or thank you for that
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
question I wish it did this law
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
specifically this RSA 2011 dco and 11
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
specifically addresses confidentiality
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
of Library users so I don't believe
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
that's the public school
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
library um this is these are this is
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
public pertaining to public public
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
libraries like Town libraries so and I
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer for the schools
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
all right representative Smith thank you
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much um for explaining
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
this to us do you see any
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions other than those that you
 
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
identified for
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
um uh that are already noted in the rsas
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you children adults yes thank
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
you representative orgon um yes there is
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
a reference to a court order in um part
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
two but that's um but that's uh that's a
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
court order explicitly allowing the
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
library card usage to be divulged but
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
how do you prove that the information
 
00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:51.319 align:start position:0%
was divulged without consented
 
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
individual or and how do you prove who
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
did it and um so what's and also so um
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
how did you arrive at the fine which
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
seems like a fairly excessive fine so
 
00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
might dissuade people from volunteering
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
at their local library yeah so how but
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
how can you start with your first
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
question yeah and then I'll yeah okay
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
what's the first one again well how do
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
you how do you how do you prove what's
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
the procedure for proving that this
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
happened that this information was in
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
fact actually divulged and then who
 
00:42:27.309 --> 00:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
divulged it and then also like okay well
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
give you the example that happened in
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
our town um a right to know was filed by
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
the wife of our select board chair and
 
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't the the people that it
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
happened to all all six Library
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
candidates actually had no idea that
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
that had happened except that the next
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
thing we knew they were all over social
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
media the library cards so the the the
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
candidates were how the heck what is
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
happening so the candidates or one of
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
them filed a right to know with the
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
library saying how did how did this come
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
to this that's where we found out who
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
had filed the original right to know for
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
the information our select board's
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
wife's chair chair's wife had requested
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
them um so that's how we found that out
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
through a right to know and that's and
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
then so what's your second question well
 
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
you you actually have a follow the uh
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
well the fine that seems like an
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
excessive fine but also you rais the
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
question then and um is there this is
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
there an exception for in the context of
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
a political campaign what if you have
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
like very contentious campaign for
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
Library board trusty and somebody
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
accuses one of the other candidates of
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh of not having a library card so can
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
that would that could that lead to the
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
candidate being fined I I believe
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
someone brought that up in in the he the
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
hearing last week is so let's say
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
someone runs for Budget committee are
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
can we ask for someone's bank card to
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
prove prove that they they have some
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
sort of you know handling of money
 
00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0%
experience I mean in what other areas
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
are we asking people to prove something
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
with using their private information to
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
do so it was mentioned that if people
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
want to you know come up and ask a
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
candidate if that's the case then that's
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
their prerogative to do so but
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
publishing it all over the Internet and
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere else is not the way okay can
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
I get back to like or represent man
 
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.079 align:start position:0%
representative man thank you Mr chair
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um so
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
we heard earlier about a bill about
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
parents receiving information on minor
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
child's Library information or status is
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
that outside of this bill is or is that
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
outside of 91a that first you familiar
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
with absolutely so that would be exempt
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
from this yes okay thank you yeah that's
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
a whole different thing other questions
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
for this witness you know I I guess I
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
have a question on with regard
 
00:44:56.549 --> 00:44:56.559 align:start position:0%
to um section four the the the penalty
 
00:44:56.559 --> 00:44:57.829 align:start position:0%
to um section four the the the penalty
provision

00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
um I have no problem with saying any
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
library or Library staff member I guess
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
I have some question about any member of
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
the public in other words is am I
 
00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:13.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that this would mean that
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
if if I as a member of the public know
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
from whatever from somebody telling me
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
or whatever um that you have a library
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
card I'm prohibited from saying to
 
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
um representative Missour has a library
 
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
card why well publicizing it so I mean
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's it says discloses so disclosers
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
could mean I tell representative Oregon
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
I've disclosed it well I I don't think
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate to do that um and in
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
our in the case in our town it was a
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
member of the general public who
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
submitted a right to know and then
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
published it all over the Internet she
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
disclosed that private information
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
without our consent it's one thing if
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
you give consent to people to do that
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
that would be like you know disclosing
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
any other private information that you
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
told someone in confidence and then
 
00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:11.720 align:start position:0%
they're putting it out to the world
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
right I mean I guess what I'm getting I
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
guess what I understand what you're
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
conern concerned about with the right to
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
know and we've I think we've probably
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
addressed that with the other bill that
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
we've you know to say you can't that's
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
going to be confidential information but
 
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:27.640 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is this seems to me to
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
say that I can't however I got for
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
example you
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
might suppose that you know
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
your husband daughter relative tells me
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the course of casual conversation
 
00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
that you have a library card and I tell
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan this would seem to
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
me to say that I could be H liable for
 
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
doing that mhm I mean if it's if um the
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee would be amendable I can I can
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
change that disclose word to you know
 
00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.150 align:start position:0%
change that disclose word to you know
who

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
publishes um publicly
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
publishes information but I guess I'm my
 
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
concern is just gen the basically the
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
idea of saying any member of the public
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
yeah um that's because that's what
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
happened in our town and it I mean it
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
went viral those cards and and there
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
were people is there a First Amendment
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
issue here that in other words a member
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
you're telling me that as a member of
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
the public I I haven't gotten you know I
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
haven't broken into or made an improper
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
91a request or anything I just I'm a
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
member of the public and I have
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
information that you have a library card
 
00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
is there is there a First Amendment
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
problem with you're saying I cannot tell
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
somebody this is a privacy issue but if
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
I know it's no longer private I know
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
that information well now that's the
 
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
case in our town everybody knows who
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
does and who doesn't it's to prevent
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
that in the future because it's you know
 
00:48:09.589 --> 00:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
let's say someone's this is a a silly
 
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
analogy but let's say someone running
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
for Budget committee you know stashes
 
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:15.640 align:start position:0%
all of their money you know under their
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
Mattress versus use utilizing a bank for
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
it and someone knows that information
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
like I guess that
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
could you know go wherever it is but it
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
just I don't know it just rep
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander represent
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair um would
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
the sponsor be amendable to an amendment
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
that would drop section two and just
 
00:48:41.069 --> 00:48:41.079 align:start position:0%
maintain section one to clarify so drop
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
the penalty because I think that was
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
where the a lot of the questions are
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
coming from and just leave section one
 
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
would the sponsor be amendable to that I
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
would be amendable to that it sounds
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
though like that it's just that word who
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
discloses that discloses word yeah well
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know I I I mean I guess what I would
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
say I don't have any problem I mean I
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
actually think that the idea of having
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
some kind of a penalty is probably a
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
good idea if you want to you know I but
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
my only concern was how broad it would
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
be because you know the analogy that I
 
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
would draw is this I think I know in
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
many states and I think it's true in New
 
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire somebody can correct me if I'm
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
wrong whether you have a pistol permit
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
even though you don't need one anymore
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
you can still get one whether you have a
 
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
pistol permit is is that the police are
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
not supposed to disclose that right but
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
if I if I know from some source that you
 
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
have a pistol permit and I say and I
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
tell you know representative burgon oh
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative Missouri has a pistol
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
permit can I be held liable for that if
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't get it I didn't get any I
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
didn't break into and and take any
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
confidential information I just know
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
that you have a pistol permit it that
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
just seems to me to be awfully
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
awfully broad I think I'm just a staunch
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
defender of privacy and this what we
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
experienced in our town and there are
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
many on both sides of the aisle that
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
agreed that this was an egregious breach
 
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
of privacy especi especially publishing
 
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.240 align:start position:0%
them all over the place I guess it's but
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
then it it is if you know you keep going
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
down this path and it's just a con
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
people will then just start
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
this will become just a thing in our
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
elections and beyond that people start
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
weaponizing private information to win
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
elections and and this is just not the
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
way this is just a small step in trying
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
to trying to have that not happen again
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
and by putting a penalty on it um that
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
because right now what's what's the
 
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
repercussion of it nothing a little slap
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
on the hand big deal they'll just
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
continue to do it again so that that was
 
00:50:57.309 --> 00:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
you if you would like to amend it in a
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
way that makes it
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
more zoned in on
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
just the you know the library card
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
versus membership status I that's a
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
possibility as
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
Welles Alexander thank you Mr chair I'm
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
happy to um while you're traveling in
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
Southeast Asia Workshop this bill and
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
get it to a a good point if that's what
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
you prefer yeah yeah no no that that
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
that'd be great um other questions for
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
this witness I I just want
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you I just
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
want to point out how easy it is to
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
share information that perhaps isn't
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily public for example where one
 
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
traveling right um all right I don't see
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank thank you very
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
much representative M so
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
so you know what what I would say uh
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative uh Alexander is
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
I the things that I would obviously the
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can do what it pleases and
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
it'll come back before the committee but
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest it would be
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate to think about would be
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps just removing the reference to a
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
member of the public number one and the
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
second thing that I would suggest you
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
might want to think about
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
is restitution in the law has a
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
particular meaning it means you've like
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
been har you know to give you back a um
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
something that you've that you've lost
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
and I would think as really as as you
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
said I think a couple times in your
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
testimony representative M this is
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
really intended as sort of a civil
 
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
penalty so I would say it might be
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
better to just refer to it instead of
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
saying restitution refer to it as a
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
civil penalty a $500 civil penalty can I
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
just something you said it's to address
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
something that someone's lost well many
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
people have lost trust through this
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
process so yes something was lost in
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
this breach yeah I'm not sure that that
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
would be the kind of thing that you
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
could measure to you know I I think it
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
really as you isn't the idea here to
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
sort of a sanction it's not it's it I
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
mean even if the person you know suppose
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
in the example the person you know
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
actually who was disclosed not to have a
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
library card won an overwhelming victory
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the election for Library trustee I
 
00:53:34.349 --> 00:53:34.359 align:start position:0%
mean you do you want to say do you want
 
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
to say well no no no you didn't you
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
didn't lose anything you you actually
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know you you won a slam dunk an
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
overwhelming Victory you'd still want
 
00:53:46.109 --> 00:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
them to pay the to have to pay wouldn't
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
you all right so that's why I'm just
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
saying it might Mak more sense to call
 
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
it a civil penalty CU that's kind of
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
what it is and I wouldn't have
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
personally I wouldn't have any problem
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
with that just myself that it was there
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
were several other people that were
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
involved in this and there was no course
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
of action that that there was nothing
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
that could be taken we tried the
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman thing that was six months of
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
wasted time um and then we don't we're
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
not going to pay a lot of money for a
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
court action when in our it it was I've
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
the current law to us seemed so clear I
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
just so this just
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
tightens it up and we heard from right
 
00:54:31.069 --> 00:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
to know New Hampshire in the last
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
hearing that they agreed that they can't
 
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
believe that clarification is needed on
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
this but apparently it is and they
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
agreed with
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
that other questions for this witness
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative um I would just chime
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
in very quickly and express the
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
opinion I guess it's okay to do so now
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
that $500 might be an excessive uh
 
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
penalty for this violation too so we we
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
want something that's not so large that
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
it will start dissuading people from
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
taking a low paying job at the library
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
or being a volunteer or so forth they're
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
just fair point if that was a I'm sorry
 
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
if that was a question I'll say no
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
that's to dissuade people from releasing
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
people's private information that's what
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
that is it might it might have it okay
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
all right yeah we don't we want I think
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have a debate here on
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
that um all right any other questions
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
for this witness thank you
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the hearing on House
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 687
 
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
FN um hang on one second and um
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
represent uh recognized representative
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
corkrin the prime sponsor thank you uh
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
Representatives so uh this bill is
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
pretty simple uh and best of all it has
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
zero cost associated with it and uh what
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
it does is just put in restrictions on
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
where funds from class action
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
settlements can be directed uh this is a
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
problem that my research has shown uh
 
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't been too much of an issue in New
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but is in several other states
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
and has been at the federal level um
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
often there will be a situation where a
 
01:00:06.789 --> 01:00:06.799 align:start position:0%
class action lawsuit is driven not So
 
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640 align:start position:0%
Much by uh huge claims to the plaintiffs
 
01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.039 align:start position:0%
although there are certainly going to be
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
some claims uh damages or it wouldn't
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
get anywhere um but are driven largely
 
01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
by uh lawyers sometimes lawyers
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
associated with an activist cause so uh
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
one example might be that um milk has
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
been mislabeled it's been labeled as 4%
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh fat and it's actually you know
 
01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
3.92% fat and testing has shown this and
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
the uh attorneys and the activists will
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
go out sort of effectively shopping for
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
a plain of class um and you know they
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
will either you know find 500 people to
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
sign up or have their activist list of
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
people who are always happy to say yes I
 
01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
bought a gallon of milk and I feel that
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
I was damaged by not getting the full
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
percent of butter
 
01:00:53.309 --> 01:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
fat the damages in such a situation um
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
might not be you know hugely
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
quantifiable but there'll be number
 
01:00:58.829 --> 01:00:58.839 align:start position:0%
arrived at and then uh the courts will
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
often not want to cut checks of 2.3
 
01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:05.559 align:start position:0%
cents uh to each of 10,000 plaintiffs um
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
and the uh attorneys will say oh you
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
know of course you don't the overhead on
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
that would be outrageous let's do
 
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
something useful with the settlement the
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
$100,000 of settlement should really go
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
to the vegans for Farm law reform or you
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
know something like that and you can
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
picture this in various directions um
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily A you know leftwing
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
activist right-wing activist can do this
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
um and the you know intent of class
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
action lawsuits is good where any one
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
person has some degree of harms you know
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
there's radon in my basement or there's
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
a defective bumper on my truck and I did
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
in fact suffer $200 of damages from this
 
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
um but it would never be worth $225,000
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
in attorney fees to write this uh wrong
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
uh so the intent of class action
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits is that by consolidating all of
 
01:01:52.349 --> 01:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
these cases and consolidating all of the
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
harms but only going through one uh
 
01:01:57.269 --> 01:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um that you know sort of justice
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
has arrived at without a huge amount of
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
friction and the uh intent of this sort
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
of minor uh clarification which brings
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
us in line with a few other states that
 
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
have such things is there can in fact be
 
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
you know such lawsuits these are a good
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
useful tool uh but we want to make sure
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
that the actual intent of a class action
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh is achieved and not some
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
other intent that's sort of riding in
 
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
the form of a legitimate class action
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and uh I would invite any
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
time is there anyone else um who wishes
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
687 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
687 could I ask a question of um anyone
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
who might be a former member of the
 
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.549 align:start position:0%
who might be a former member of the
judicial

01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
brand yes you may thank you would you I
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
Cypress not being an attorney could you
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
explain to
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
me the
 
01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.230 align:start position:0%
me the
relevance

01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
relevance
 
01:03:18.269 --> 01:03:18.279 align:start position:0%
in in in
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation yeah I think um and
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
please understand I don't profess to be
 
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
but thank you for that now I've learned
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
something good but um basically I I
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
think it is it is a judicial doctrine
 
01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's been around I think really for
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
centuries and it allows the court um let
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
me give you an example which comes to
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
mind you may remember the the um the
 
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:54.039 align:start position:0%
Youth Development Center oh yes the uh I
 
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
think it's the Youth Development Center
 
01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.150 align:start position:0%
think it's the Youth Development Center
the

01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
I think that I think I've got that right
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
originally the land that that was on was
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
was U
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
donated um
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
to I I'm not I'm either the city of
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
mansion I'm not sure who or the state it
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
was donated for certain purposes to be
 
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.309 align:start position:0%
was donated for certain purposes to be
used

01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
for um and and I'm just making this up
 
01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
because I don't frankly remember but
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
there to be be used for let's say to be
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
used for um uh the establishment of a
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
school let's say and let's say for one
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
reason or another there is no longer a
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
need for the school in other words
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
there's you know the the the educational
 
01:04:47.789 --> 01:04:47.799 align:start position:0%
needs of the of the children of
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester are being taken care of in
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
other ways this would allow a court to
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
say well okay I'm going to allow the
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
trust that established this to be change
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
the terms to be changed to something
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
that you know satisfies the the more
 
01:05:10.589 --> 01:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
General intent of the person who made
 
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
the who made the donation that I think
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
that maybe is a bit of an
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
oversimplification but that's kind of
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
generally the idea thank you thank you I
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
when I was chair of Finance long time
 
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
ago I wanted to close YDC
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
because and because anyone who knew
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
no in recess or well yeah no we're no we
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:24.549 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.559 --> 01:06:54.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
something we might want to consider when
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
we when we get around to executing the
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
is it is it the role of us the
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
government to tell people in private
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
litigation what their class action
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
settlements should be there if the
 
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
parties you know I just raised the
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
question maybe the answer is yes but I
 
01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
just rais the
 
01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:24.430 align:start position:0%
just rais the
question

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
anyway

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:24.349 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe nobody's

amendment thank you chairman Len I'd

01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
move Amendment
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
2025 a move ought to pass on um with
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment 225 d016 7h and I second all

Amendment 225 d016 7h and I second all
right

01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
so now
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
going and the amendment is simply
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:18.239 --> 01:45:21.270 align:start position:0%
 
lines

01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
24 and
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
23 it's changing that with a victim less
 
01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:29.719 align:start position:0%
than 18 years of age on both of those
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
lines rather than saying 16 years of age
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
or under or less than 16 and making
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
it two different two different numbers
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
there so less than 18 years of age
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's all the amendment is doing and I
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
the prosecutor was here uh attorney
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.950 --> 01:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
in agreement that the amendment would
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
work right and I as I understand this
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
this this is a this is an amendment that
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
was jointly proposed by you and
 
01:46:04.709 --> 01:46:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative tur is that correct that
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
is correct um and so um again my
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
recollection from our discussion of I
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
think it was last week was that this was
 
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
the only issue that you know sort of um
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
was was any that anyone had any any
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
problem with and otherwise it it
 
01:46:24.470 --> 01:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
appeared that we were all generally
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to this bill with the
 
01:46:30.589 --> 01:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
amendment um am I in am I incorrect in
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
that is anybody have any issue that um
 
01:46:33.719 --> 01:46:34.510 align:start position:0%
that is anybody have any issue that um
you

01:46:34.510 --> 01:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:36.750 --> 01:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
know any reason that we shouldn't
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
execute now representative
 
01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
Andrews I'm going to get back to the
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
same thing I'm going to vote no because
 
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
I think we need 20 people here to vote
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee 18 sorry about that all right
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
all right um all right uh I appreciate
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
your position representative Andrew but
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
I think I given the circumstances here I

introducing House Bill 697 on behalf of
 
01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
the Prime sponsor R Penza who couldn't
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
be here
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
today this bill allows witness fees for
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings for civilian
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
Witnesses who appear in court to testify
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
and it is giving the same rate of fees
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
as those federally
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
authorized all right um any any
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
witness see I I I I don't know whether
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
you're in the position to answer this
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
but can you I should know this but it's
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
been a long time since I was uh in
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
federal court so what what is the
 
01:51:49.229 --> 01:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
1821 I think it's like 35
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
I think currently we have it as $35 and
 
01:51:58.109 --> 01:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
we're in let me just check what I don't
 
01:51:59.390 --> 01:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
want to give you inter give me one
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
second let me look and see what it is
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
now and what it would be going to just
 
01:52:02.159 --> 01:52:11.870 align:start position:0%
now and what it would be going to just
so

01:52:11.870 --> 01:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
I so we actually repealed that witness V
 
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
$40 per day $40 per day is the witness
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
fee and federal C correct okay all right
 
01:52:33.719 --> 01:52:34.470 align:start position:0%
fee and federal C correct okay all right
and

01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
hours you you said I think where I
 
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
remember from last year that we had
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
repealed or I'm not sure if we did it
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
but it was there was no witness fee
 
01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
stated is that is that
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
right it got repealed it used to be $12
 
01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
it was repealed in
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
2019 okay all right anybody else have
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
Smith Oh representative buron you go
 
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
first then representative
 
01:53:10.589 --> 01:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
Smith I just have one question when I
 
01:53:11.709 --> 01:53:11.719 align:start position:0%
see the
 
01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
word entitled to a payment does that
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
mean that that could just change on
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
constituents because it just says
 
01:53:21.069 --> 01:53:21.079 align:start position:0%
payment it doesn't say an exact amount
 
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
that can be adjust adjusted when if in
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
the event that the cost is adjusted or
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
do you think we should just leave the
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
word it shall be entitled to a payment
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
and that's all it says it doesn't have
 
01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.950 align:start position:0%
and that's all it says it doesn't have
like

01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
a I'm not sure where you're seeing
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
entitled to a payment oh entitled to a
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
payment for each day but it it gives the
 
01:53:43.629 --> 01:53:43.639 align:start position:0%
rate the rate of the fee shall be the
 
01:53:46.030 --> 01:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
same as those authorized in 28 USC
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
section one uh
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
1821 as the last sentence okay perfect
 
01:53:52.719 --> 01:53:53.430 align:start position:0%
1821 as the last sentence okay perfect
thank

01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:53:58.750 --> 01:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Smith thank you
 
01:54:00.669 --> 01:54:00.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm
 
01:54:00.679 --> 01:54:03.189 align:start position:0%
um I'm
confused

01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
confused
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
um this seems to apply to when someone
 
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
has to come back again for reasons that
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
are no fault of their own what happens
 
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
when they're there the first time do
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursed think the answer is no
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank to my knowledge they do not and I
 
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
would be happy to pay them both times
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
but I think she was at least trying to
 
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
take a bite of the Apple particularly
 
01:54:36.790 --> 01:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
for the cases that are really far away
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
people are taking time out of work and
 
01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
driving sometimes quite a bit of a
 
01:54:43.470 --> 01:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
distance to get there and not receiving
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
any payment and could I follow up of
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
course yes thank you and does that does
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that we don't reimburse the
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
first time explain why we are using not
 
01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
a state rate but a federal rate because
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
we have no State
 
01:55:07.709 --> 01:55:07.719 align:start position:0%
rate I believe that to be the case thank
 
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
you and the only other question I have
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
is should we be if if
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
we pass the bill the way it's worded
 
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
with that reference to the federal
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
statute um should there be any concern
 
01:55:25.390 --> 01:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
should we have any concern that if the
 
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
feds which have not been known to
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
control spending very well decide that
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to increase the rate to
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
$100 a day or something like that that
 
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
then we will be on the hook to do the
 
01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:42.189 align:start position:0%
then we will be on the hook to do the
same

01:55:42.189 --> 01:55:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
thing well I should hope that with this
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill we will
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
make a much better effort to ensure that
 
01:55:51.870 --> 01:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have witnesses driving in for
 
01:55:53.629 --> 01:55:53.639 align:start position:0%
cases that are not then going to be
 
01:55:53.639 --> 01:55:55.229 align:start position:0%
cases that are not then going to be
heard

01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
because I I would hope that the reason
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
why we're having people come in should
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
be a pretty limited limited circumstance
 
01:56:03.629 --> 01:56:03.639 align:start position:0%
and that we should know ahead of time
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
that there's been some extenuating
 
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
circumstance or whatnot so I'd hope that
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
we would just do a better job to to not
 
01:56:13.149 --> 01:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
have this happen representative Smith
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative cutab what
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
would happen if in the fullness of time
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
um the federal government would decide
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
that will no longer uh uh pay uh witness
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
fees and uh would that then mean that we
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
would not be paying a fee that we think
 
01:56:38.830 --> 01:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
is appropriate to pay I suppose that
 
01:56:40.350 --> 01:56:40.360 align:start position:0%
could happen just as it could happen
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
that we reference with our in in the
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
State Rep statute for us to get Federal
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
mileage reimbursement that they could
 
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
come back and decide we're not going to
 
01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
pay federal mileage anymore so I I think
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
it definitely it could happen
 
01:56:55.870 --> 01:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
um hopefully it
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't representative
 
01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
trip thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that uh uh you hop that uh
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have people driving in to
 
01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:11.990 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have people driving in to
uh

01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
testify at a case and then not having
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
the case heard is that something that
 
01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.229 align:start position:0%
the case heard is that something that
happens

01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
frequently I'm not sure of the exact
 
01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
frequency but it definitely does happen
 
01:57:25.629 --> 01:57:25.639 align:start position:0%
it happened in the case of the Prime
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor who put in the bill and I do
 
01:57:29.470 --> 01:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
want to note that the federal rate was
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
Set uh in September of 1996 and has not
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
changed since so it's been about 29
 
01:57:38.109 --> 01:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
same any other questions for this
 
01:57:44.669 --> 01:57:44.679 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you are there
 
01:57:48.149 --> 01:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
any other witnesses that wish to appear
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 697 FN
 
01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none um I would um be I guess
 
01:57:58.270 --> 01:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
before I close the hearing just so that
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
we're still on the record you know one
 
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
one of things I would say in
 
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative cutab just on in my
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
experience and and uh representative
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
Manion may be able to shed some light on
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
this also I think it does
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
happen with some frequency that
 
01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:17.430 align:start position:0%
happen with some frequency that
Witnesses

01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
Witnesses
 
01:58:20.669 --> 01:58:20.679 align:start position:0%
are as as have to come back multiple
 
01:58:22.109 --> 01:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
days because what often happen I mean I
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
mean I remember when I was when I was a
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
prosecutor we it often happened that I
 
01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
that you know I would have more
 
01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
witnesses than I needed for for the
 
01:58:38.589 --> 01:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
particular day be there because if
 
01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
somehow a witness took less time than I
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
thought and I ended up with no Witnesses
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
the judge was gonna was going to be
 
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
yelling at me why aren't you you know
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
why are we wasting all this time because
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
we know we're not finishing up today
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
because you don't have any Witnesses so
 
01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
in order to once you've heard that a few
 
01:58:57.229 --> 01:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
times and and frankly when I was a judge
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
I think I would probably have done the
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
same thing you you want you you've set
 
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
aside some time for trial you expect the
 
01:59:05.069 --> 01:59:05.079 align:start position:0%
whatever you expect the sides to have
 
01:59:07.470 --> 01:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
their witnesses there and since it's not
 
01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
in any way an exact science what I think
 
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
what most good lawyers will do is make
 
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
sure that they they're not going to run
 
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
out of Witnesses on any particular day
 
01:59:19.629 --> 01:59:19.639 align:start position:0%
which may mean that so you know they
 
01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
have extra Witnesses and somebody has to
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
come back I I that that's that was my
 
01:59:25.069 --> 01:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
experience I don't know about you uh
 
01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
represented man
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
you yeah I agree with that um we didn't
 
01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:30.639 align:start position:0%
have a lot of cases where there a lot of
 
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
witnesses that I prosecuted but yeah I I
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:39.800 align:start position:0%
you all right uh yes representative trip
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
since we're just making comments i' like
 
01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
to comment that uh I was uh asked to be
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
a witness at it a a case one time and I
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
I drove from dairy to probably Portsmith
 
01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
five times and the case was never
 
01:59:59.470 --> 01:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
heard you so not getting paid for the
 
02:00:04.589 --> 02:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
first time you know is a is an issue to
 
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
me thank you sure sure no I I hear you I
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
hear you um yeah I mean I I my own sense
 
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
I think generally I think this is the
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
bill is a is a good idea but you may be
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
right maybe we should you know maybe we
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
should be paying people should be paying
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
for the first time that you might be
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
right um well if the if the case isn't
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
heard does that mean it's not the first
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
time uh yeah I think that's I think
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
that's I mean especially if you've been
 
02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
told to be there and then for at the
 
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
last minute the case isn't heard which
 
02:00:39.069 --> 02:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
frequency all right well that's I mean
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's you know something for us to
 
02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
consider when it's time to exec the bill
 
02:00:48.069 --> 02:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
um uh so now I'm going to close the
 
02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 696 FN and we actually
 
02:00:55.470 --> 02:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
have time for
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
lunch must have I must have done
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
given this budget season I'd be fine
 
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:43.030 --> 02:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
all right is everybody comfortable if we
 
02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.189 align:start position:0%
all right is everybody comfortable if we
exact

02:02:44.189 --> 02:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
exact
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
697 all right so um I so I'm going to
 
02:02:52.629 --> 02:02:52.639 align:start position:0%
open the executive session and yeah yeah
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
yeah sure absolutely
 
02:02:56.109 --> 02:02:56.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely take your time just let me
 
02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
at oh K yeah that's
 
02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
a is this still
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
on say
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
97 no it's it's not an it's not an early
 
02:03:42.719 --> 02:03:49.589 align:start position:0%
97 no it's it's not an it's not an early
Bill

02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
no all right all right so
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
um uh HB 697 FN we I'm going to open the
 
02:04:01.629 --> 02:04:01.639 align:start position:0%
executive session and um do I have a
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
motion with regard to House Bill 697 FN
 
02:04:19.549 --> 02:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:22.990 --> 02:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
FN all right um
 
02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
all right um representative kab you wish
 
02:04:28.549 --> 02:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.229 --> 02:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
motion I just simply that I think if
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
we're requiring that a witness have to
 
02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
be somewhere or subpoenaing them there
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
they should have some sort of
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
compensation for the time that they're
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to be out of work and for the
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
mileage that they're you know driving up
 
02:04:43.629 --> 02:04:43.639 align:start position:0%
there I think it's only fair that if
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
we're requiring that we're taking up
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
their day their freedom for that day
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
that we should we should give them a
 
02:04:52.149 --> 02:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
little bit of money in exchange for that
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
right anybody else wish to be heard on
 
02:04:54.400 --> 02:04:56.470 align:start position:0%
right anybody else wish to be heard on
uh

02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
697 now I say as I I I think
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative Trip's point about um you
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
know maybe at some point in the future
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
we want to consider even for the first
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
time but as as you point out
 
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
representative katab given the current
 
02:05:11.709 --> 02:05:11.719 align:start position:0%
budget situation maybe it's better to
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
get something for now and wait um and
 
02:05:17.109 --> 02:05:17.119 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to let the perfect
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
become the enemy of the good so um
 
02:05:21.069 --> 02:05:21.079 align:start position:0%

say
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right so um I then asked the clerk

um reprentative couta can I call upon
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
you again would you mind making the
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
writing the report I'd be happy to
 
02:06:19.149 --> 02:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
um then will there be a Minority Report
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
to representative Andrew I have a
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
question yes
 
02:06:26.189 --> 02:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
where I'm doing no on the exact bills
 
02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
yeah do I have to write a report for
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
each or should I for each bill that is
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not against the bill I'm just
 
02:06:36.910 --> 02:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
against the process or can I do it all
 
02:06:39.189 --> 02:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
on one I think you have to I think you
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
have to do it bill by Bill right I mean
 
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
mean but you could say one you could say
 
02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:47.430 align:start position:0%
mean but you could say one you could say
in

02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
one if I could respond sure just because
 
02:06:54.910 --> 02:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
you voted no does not mean that you have
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
to write a Minority Report there doesn't
 
02:07:00.830 --> 02:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
have to be a Minority Report however if
 
02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:01.669 align:start position:0%
have to be a Minority Report however if
you

02:07:01.669 --> 02:07:01.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
are uh if you if you want to make clear
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
your reason is process and not the bill
 
02:07:13.470 --> 02:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
itself you can do it
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
once and Bill no because I do not
 
02:07:22.709 --> 02:07:22.719 align:start position:0%
believe that you can name
 
02:07:25.870 --> 02:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
other bills in a Minority Report you can
 
02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
only name the bill that you're writing
 
02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report on so if you want to
 
02:07:34.669 --> 02:07:34.679 align:start position:0%
make your point you can make it
 
02:07:38.069 --> 02:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
once and then let it go but if you want
 
02:07:40.189 --> 02:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
to make it three times you're going to
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
have to write three minority reports and
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
right right right this could go on
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
consent right if she doesn't want to
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
write a Minority Report this bill could
 
02:08:03.549 --> 02:08:03.559 align:start position:0%
just go but the point that that I just
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
completely missed that is absolutely
 
02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
true is you would have to have a
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation and if you don't want
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
your recommendation to be it can't be
 
02:08:18.990 --> 02:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
the same as it can't be OTP in the case
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.669 --> 02:08:26.679 align:start position:0%
um Louise may
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
I so you could you could in fact I guess
 
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
you could say
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
retain um which would be a different
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
position and which would indicate that
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
it should come back to the committee for
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider and your hope
 
02:08:46.549 --> 02:08:46.559 align:start position:0%
would be that it would be with with more
 
02:08:46.559 --> 02:08:47.790 align:start position:0%
would be that it would be with with more
people

02:08:47.790 --> 02:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
present representative Andrews may I
 
02:08:52.709 --> 02:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
suggest not not that I want to prolong
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
us at house session days but instead of
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
writing minority reports on all of those
 
02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
bills maybe say something during
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
unanimous consent about how you voted
 
02:09:03.149 --> 02:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
against these bills because you don't
 
02:09:05.709 --> 02:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
agree with them with the process and
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
that might solve your problem where
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
you're able to make the statement but
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
you don't disagree with the committee
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
position yeah yeah that's fine okay sure
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah and she could do it as a
 
02:09:17.790 --> 02:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately could do it as a floor
 
02:09:19.549 --> 02:09:19.559 align:start position:0%
speech on the first of these bills and
 
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
then uh and I think at least imply that
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
she feels the same way about certain
 
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
other bills that are also going to be on
 
02:09:28.350 --> 02:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
the reg the calendar yeah no that's
 
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
right yeah there's no sense of me
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
retaining a bill yeah I mean that's
 
02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
crazy so if it excuse me if it's okay I
 
02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
just won't write any reports and I'll
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
just make a statement on the house FL
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
okay so can we put this one on consent
 
02:09:52.189 --> 02:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
we put this on consent then or no
 
02:09:54.549 --> 02:09:54.559 align:start position:0%
because then she would go to the oh okay
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
no all right well I thought she's giving
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
a I thought she's giving unanimous
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
consent on all three bills at once no
 
02:10:01.390 --> 02:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
she's not talking about unanimous
 
02:10:03.350 --> 02:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
consent Kaitlyn she's talking about when
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
is Joe suggested unanimous consent yes
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
just give a flare speech and then don't
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
do any and then the voice bubly will be
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
so L what if only one of the bills goes
 
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
on a regular calendar
 
02:10:25.870 --> 02:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
and you speak against it
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
explaining I mean you speak explaining
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
what your concerns are and that it
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
applies to other bills with the same
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
votes okay and then you can let the
 
02:10:39.549 --> 02:10:39.559 align:start position:0%
other two go on consent that's fine with
 
02:10:41.709 --> 02:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
me okay so
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
one you want the first one in numerical
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
order to go on the regular calendar the
 
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
first I think 36 9 had to go on the
 
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
regular calendar because it had not yes
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's an early bill right the other two
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
didn't like hp67 doesn't have
 
02:11:04.270 --> 02:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
to which you have one is regular I'll
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
just write a
 
02:11:07.549 --> 02:11:07.559 align:start position:0%
minority but then I got to go back to
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
ret no you don't have to write it
 
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
minority so if 369 goes on the
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
regular on the regular calendar right
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
okay you then would tell the
 
02:11:23.149 --> 02:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
clerk that that you want to
 
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
speak on
 
02:11:29.790 --> 02:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
369 and then six then
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
480 and
 
02:11:35.229 --> 02:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
697 could just go on consent does that
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
people in terms of you making your point
 
02:11:43.709 --> 02:11:43.719 align:start position:0%
and in terms of
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
efficiency yeah you know what you know
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
what for you know what I'm my only
 
02:11:50.109 --> 02:11:50.119 align:start position:0%
concern representative Smith is even
 
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
though 480 is not listed as an early
 
02:11:55.229 --> 02:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
bill that it wasn't listed because the
 
02:11:56.910 --> 02:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
original bill was just talking about a
 
02:11:59.310 --> 02:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
study committee but the amendment which
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
establishes that um the position of the
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh forensic liaison that will there is
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
there's going to need to be an
 
02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
appropriation for that so that will
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
probably have to go to finance now so I
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
would say that we probably shouldn't put
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
that on consent except that bills that
 
02:12:18.189 --> 02:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
are on consent can go to
 
02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
finance oh they can I did not know that
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
okay all right then let's put that on
 
02:12:26.549 --> 02:12:26.559 align:start position:0%
consent let's put 480 on consent and you
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that both Paul
 
02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:31.589 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that both Paul
and

02:12:31.589 --> 02:12:31.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:34.870 --> 02:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
Ken Ken's still the chair knows about
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
that right okay clarification 480 is now
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
going on consent 480 is going on
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
consent sorry about that I'm sorry for
 
02:12:46.990 --> 02:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
the confusion and the other two on the
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
regular Cal the other two on the regular
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
calendar yes and there and are no
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
minority reports at all there's there

Wall Street Journal or you know slate
 
03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:25.439 align:start position:0%

people who got their bachelor's their

Master MERS maybe an additional degree
 
03:12:31.349 --> 03:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
um and you know were following all along
 
03:12:33.150 --> 03:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what they were told by their
 
03:12:34.510 --> 03:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
middle school guidance counselors their
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
high school guidance counselors their
 
03:12:37.910 --> 03:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
parents uh the media you know the
 
03:12:39.870 --> 03:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
presidents getting up and saying uh you
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
know this nation you know needs to get
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
education education is the way to the
 
03:12:45.070 --> 03:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
middle class and the upper middle class
 
03:12:48.269 --> 03:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
and the um lenders are there and very
 
03:12:51.070 --> 03:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
eager to make all of uh you know these
 
03:12:52.910 --> 03:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
outlays to the students oh you want a
 
03:12:54.750 --> 03:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
you know a master's degree in foreign
 
03:12:56.950 --> 03:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
affairs uh undergrad in political
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
science you know here is the check just
 
03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
sign here what a lot of 17 and 18 year
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
olds uh and and that speaks by the way
 
03:13:06.150 --> 03:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
to the asymmetric negotiating position
 
03:13:08.030 --> 03:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
what a lot of very naive 17 and 18 year
 
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
olds don't understand is that student
 
03:13:12.550 --> 03:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
loans are non-dischargeable and uh that
 
03:13:14.150 --> 03:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
is something the federal government has
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
chosen to do to make sure that lenders
 
03:13:18.550 --> 03:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
are there if uh student loans were
 
03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
dischargeable in bankruptcy you would
 
03:13:24.389 --> 03:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
see 29y olds with $300,000 in debt and
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
effectively no uh tenable career path
 
03:13:28.469 --> 03:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
ahead of them because you know they're
 
03:13:30.870 --> 03:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
in a career field that maybe is uh uh
 
03:13:33.790 --> 03:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
pleasing to them but pays $30,000 a year
 
03:13:35.389 --> 03:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
they will never ever ever be able to pay
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
off these loans and then the federal
 
03:13:38.510 --> 03:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
government and their wisdom has also
 
03:13:40.110 --> 03:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
said that you cannot Escape these loans
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
even by declaring bankruptcy you can
 
03:13:42.990 --> 03:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
declare bankruptcy you can wash away
 
03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
your $20,000 in credit card your 5,000
 
03:13:47.910 --> 03:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
car loan but you still have this 300
 
03:13:50.030 --> 03:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
$400,000 of student loan hanging over
 
03:13:52.349 --> 03:13:52.359 align:start position:0%
your head and a lot of the limits that
 
03:13:54.429 --> 03:13:54.439 align:start position:0%
you see from people are I will never be
 
03:13:55.830 --> 03:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
able to afford to get married I will
 
03:13:57.229 --> 03:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
never be able to buy a house so I'll
 
03:14:00.790 --> 03:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
never do this I'll never do that um and
 
03:14:02.309 --> 03:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
obviously I'm a registered Republican
 
03:14:05.670 --> 03:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of um uh rhetoric on my
 
03:14:08.030 --> 03:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle um you know not in the
 
03:14:09.269 --> 03:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh general court but you know in the
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
populace as a whole you know haha well
 
03:14:12.389 --> 03:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
that'll teach you to get a degree in
 
03:14:14.070 --> 03:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
underwater basket weaving you know as
 
03:14:17.110 --> 03:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
the joke goes and um you know it's and
 
03:14:18.710 --> 03:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
in fact not really funny these are
 
03:14:20.790 --> 03:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
people who made these decisions when
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
they were very young they followed all
 
03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
of the best advice that was given to
 
03:14:25.469 --> 03:14:25.479 align:start position:0%
them and they are in an entirely
 
03:14:27.190 --> 03:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
untenable life
 
03:14:29.830 --> 03:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
path now a lot of degrees are in fact
 
03:14:32.590 --> 03:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
useful um you know nursing degrees stem
 
03:14:34.990 --> 03:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
degrees um even you know other uh
 
03:14:37.229 --> 03:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
degrees are tenable for certain people
 
03:14:39.469 --> 03:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
if you are uh you know a child of the
 
03:14:40.870 --> 03:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
wealthy you can go off and you can get a
 
03:14:42.229 --> 03:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
history degree you can follow it up with
 
03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
a history PhD you can have a great
 
03:14:47.630 --> 03:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
career because you've got your um you
 
03:14:49.910 --> 03:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
know family wealth waiting there for you
 
03:14:51.710 --> 03:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
but for a lot of other people who don't
 
03:14:52.830 --> 03:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
understand that you know they've sort of
 
03:14:54.990 --> 03:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
walked into a Porsche dealership and
 
03:14:57.429 --> 03:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
they're being offered these luxury goods
 
03:14:59.469 --> 03:14:59.479 align:start position:0%
that are being sold under the premise
 
03:15:01.950 --> 03:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
that these are investments uh it is a
 
03:15:04.830 --> 03:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
very bad situation so that brings us to
 
03:15:07.389 --> 03:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
the actual bill before us right now this
 
03:15:10.429 --> 03:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
bill defines certain um Educational
 
03:15:12.990 --> 03:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
Services as sort of inherently
 
03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
fraudulent or deceptive and so you know
 
03:15:17.229 --> 03:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
let's get into that is is this a
 
03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
subjective decision should there be
 
03:15:20.110 --> 03:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
someone who said well you know I got an
 
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
engineering degree so it's you know if
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
you majored in social work that's
 
03:15:25.389 --> 03:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
inherently deceptive you know no that
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
that is the wrong approach to take to
 
03:15:29.229 --> 03:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
this and there are a lot of uh degrees
 
03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
that at a certain price point are quite
 
03:15:33.070 --> 03:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh someone can you know if
 
03:15:34.429 --> 03:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
you can get a history degree for you
 
03:15:37.790 --> 03:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
know $25,000 $30,000 that's reasonable
 
03:15:40.110 --> 03:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
the problem is if people are being given
 
03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
these degrees that will never pay for
 
03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
themselves so uh there is uh some math
 
03:15:45.910 --> 03:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
in here but I'd like to walk through the
 
03:15:47.950 --> 03:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
math what do I mean by will never pay
 
03:15:50.189 --> 03:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
for itself if someone graduates with a
 
03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
degree and gets an average job in their
 
03:15:55.630 --> 03:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
industry and then they take 30% of their
 
03:15:57.590 --> 03:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
take-home pay which is quite a lot you
 
03:15:59.469 --> 03:15:59.479 align:start position:0%
know I remember being a 21y old and
 
03:16:01.150 --> 03:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
paying you know half my salary just for
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
an apartment um 30% of your salary every
 
03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
month for 10 years if that can't pay off
 
03:16:11.710 --> 03:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
your degree then you are uh effectively
 
03:16:14.150 --> 03:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
in a debt trap you know if 30% for 10
 
03:16:16.349 --> 03:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
years can't get you out what possibly
 
03:16:19.189 --> 03:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
could get you out out now we talked
 
03:16:20.590 --> 03:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
before about if you were in a certain
 
03:16:22.269 --> 03:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
situation you know maybe you were the
 
03:16:24.750 --> 03:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
you know a Rockefeller Scion and you
 
03:16:26.550 --> 03:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely know that your passion is to
 
03:16:28.750 --> 03:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
you know study Byzantine history uh and
 
03:16:31.070 --> 03:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need to have some high-paying
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
career at the end that is ever going to
 
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
pay for this this uh bill has a way that
 
03:16:37.110 --> 03:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
any student can just sign a waiver
 
03:16:39.309 --> 03:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
saying I understand that this
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
educational degree that you're selling
 
03:16:43.990 --> 03:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
me is not conventionally uh going to
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
result in a conventionally remunerative
 
03:16:45.920 --> 03:16:47.830 align:start position:0%
result in a conventionally remunerative
career

03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
career
 
03:16:49.790 --> 03:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
there is also the issue that a lot of
 
03:16:52.150 --> 03:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
colleges um offer degrees that are seen
 
03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
as very prestigious especially in Asia
 
03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
so a lot of colleges make a lot of money
 
03:16:59.630 --> 03:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
by selling uh degree programs to foreign
 
03:17:02.429 --> 03:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
students this bill does not extend
 
03:17:04.229 --> 03:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
protections to those foreign students
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
someone coming from mainland China um
 
03:17:08.510 --> 03:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
and paying for an American degree has
 
03:17:10.750 --> 03:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
probably uh you know got the means to do
 
03:17:13.150 --> 03:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
so and it is not New Hampshire's
 
03:17:16.030 --> 03:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
business to uh meddle in their decision
 
03:17:18.309 --> 03:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
nor in the University's business model
 
03:17:20.150 --> 03:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
of selling very expensive degrees to
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
Chinese or other people um so that is an
 
03:17:25.229 --> 03:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
overview of the bill and then finally
 
03:17:27.469 --> 03:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
this provides two kinds of action one is
 
03:17:29.830 --> 03:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
the attorney general if uh that office
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
ever desires to do anything could
 
03:17:35.229 --> 03:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
prosecute um a university for offering a
 
03:17:37.349 --> 03:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
fraudulent uh service but there is
 
03:17:38.990 --> 03:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that requires them
 
03:17:41.150 --> 03:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
to do so um if you look at the rest of
 
03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act there are
 
03:17:43.950 --> 03:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
other things where the attorney general
 
03:17:45.950 --> 03:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
has the authority they can go after a
 
03:17:47.630 --> 03:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
store for offering going out of business
 
03:17:50.550 --> 03:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
sales every 60 days they can go after a
 
03:17:52.309 --> 03:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
car dealer for you know offering certain
 
03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
services but there's nothing that forces
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
the AG's office to do that um so there's
 
03:17:59.590 --> 03:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
nothing here that compels the AG's
 
03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
office to do anything uh finally one
 
03:18:03.750 --> 03:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
question that came up in the drafting
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
with OS discussions was how would a
 
03:18:10.110 --> 03:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
student prove this um you know is there
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
a set uh criteria there are in fact uh
 
03:18:17.150 --> 03:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
lots of surveys uh showing um what
 
03:18:19.269 --> 03:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
people in various career Fields earn
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
universities themselves often gather
 
03:18:23.189 --> 03:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
this information internally and maintain
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
it but it is not the job of the bill to
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
make anyone else's case for them um
 
03:18:30.269 --> 03:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
there are many cases in the law that
 
03:18:32.469 --> 03:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
give citizens a right of private action
 
03:18:34.269 --> 03:18:34.279 align:start position:0%
and if a citizen you know has the right
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
to sue a neighbor for runoff it is the
 
03:18:37.870 --> 03:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
Citizen's job to go out and get a
 
03:18:39.870 --> 03:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
structural engineer or a groundwater
 
03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
engineer and prove their case and go to
 
03:18:45.469 --> 03:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
court and uh this bill uh has that same
 
03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh standard uh it does not uh do the
 
03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
citizens job for them I'm open any
 
03:18:52.550 --> 03:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions please questions for this
 
03:18:55.110 --> 03:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
03:18:57.670 --> 03:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
pner thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative corkren for being here I
 
03:19:04.189 --> 03:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
was smiling only because um your your uh
 
03:19:07.030 --> 03:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
s your um analogies were amusing not
 
03:19:09.870 --> 03:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
that over this situation so I have a
 
03:19:11.790 --> 03:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
question about um the Attorney General
 
03:19:14.349 --> 03:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting so for example if we have
 
03:19:15.950 --> 03:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
the university system of New Hampshire
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
which is a public colle College we would
 
03:19:19.710 --> 03:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
have a situation where the state could
 
03:19:22.750 --> 03:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
possibly be prosecuting the state in
 
03:19:25.229 --> 03:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
this situation and then and then after
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so what would you suggest in that
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
situation or would you um address this
 
03:19:31.830 --> 03:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
specifically to private colleges uh uh I
 
03:19:33.670 --> 03:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
think that's a great question and in the
 
03:19:36.189 --> 03:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
same way that the AG if they choose to
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
weighing all of the merits of the case
 
03:19:39.670 --> 03:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
weighing you know uh uh the pros and
 
03:19:42.389 --> 03:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
cons um of sort of you know political
 
03:19:44.070 --> 03:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
situation other thing for example
 
03:19:49.670 --> 03:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
chooses to uh go after a DCF employee or
 
03:19:52.670 --> 03:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
a state police employee um you know the
 
03:19:54.070 --> 03:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general you know in their
 
03:19:55.870 --> 03:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
wisdom can decide when something is
 
03:19:57.910 --> 03:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
egregious enough now uh let me raise
 
03:20:00.309 --> 03:20:00.319 align:start position:0%
another Point uh also in response to
 
03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
this that this need not be seen as sort
 
03:20:05.189 --> 03:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
of purely punitive and after the fact if
 
03:20:07.870 --> 03:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
a bill like this existed and if either a
 
03:20:09.550 --> 03:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
private college or a state college was
 
03:20:12.309 --> 03:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
tempted to offer a new eight-year degree
 
03:20:15.030 --> 03:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
in throwing ceramics at the wheel uh
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
they would have to ask hey is this
 
03:20:19.389 --> 03:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
likely uh going to put us in danger with
 
03:20:21.910 --> 03:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
this law and that incentive structure um
 
03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
is part of it so it's not just after the
 
03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
fact what the AG might do yes followup
 
03:20:28.790 --> 03:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's I'm sorry it's not technically a
 
03:20:31.630 --> 03:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up but have you ever seen or
 
03:20:34.990 --> 03:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
heard of situations in which the
 
03:20:38.429 --> 03:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
parents um complete the FAFSA and take
 
03:20:41.550 --> 03:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
on student debt that's not the student
 
03:20:43.150 --> 03:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily know that this is
 
03:20:46.309 --> 03:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
happening because they're 17 years old
 
03:20:48.269 --> 03:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
maybe when they're applying for college
 
03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
parents fill out the application and
 
03:20:54.349 --> 03:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
agree to take on the debt and the I have
 
03:20:55.790 --> 03:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
sorry if I haven't if it's in here
 
03:20:58.269 --> 03:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere and then the student finds out
 
03:21:00.389 --> 03:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
upon graduation that now they're saddled
 
03:21:02.590 --> 03:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
with this what's their recourse against
 
03:21:06.030 --> 03:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
their own parents right um so I I I am
 
03:21:08.110 --> 03:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
aware of that I think that is a tragic
 
03:21:10.950 --> 03:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
situation um and in this case I believe
 
03:21:13.150 --> 03:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
that the wording here where the parents
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
sort of you know effectively make the
 
03:21:16.710 --> 03:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
decision but offload the debt it would
 
03:21:19.229 --> 03:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
be the student again uh the metric is
 
03:21:21.710 --> 03:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
their salary um and so they would have
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
recourse um and again you know I I would
 
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
be thrilled if this will Bill were to
 
03:21:28.750 --> 03:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
pass and become law if there was never a
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
single lawsuit under this bill but if
 
03:21:33.150 --> 03:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
instead universities said you know hey
 
03:21:35.750 --> 03:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
wait a second we've been offering uh
 
03:21:37.469 --> 03:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
this one degree and a certain thing that
 
03:21:38.990 --> 03:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
no one ever gets employment in or the
 
03:21:41.790 --> 03:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
employment is $30,000 perhaps we should
 
03:21:43.389 --> 03:21:43.399 align:start position:0%
you know merge that with another degree
 
03:21:45.510 --> 03:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
or change the requirements uh for it so
 
03:21:49.229 --> 03:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
that it becomes more lucrative um so uh
 
03:21:51.229 --> 03:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
yes I I I think that's a great concern
 
03:21:52.590 --> 03:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
and that also speaks to what I was
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
introducing it as where you've got 17
 
03:21:57.110 --> 03:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
and 18year olds who are very naive uh
 
03:22:00.030 --> 03:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
have a very rose tinted glass uh view of
 
03:22:01.910 --> 03:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
the world and can get themselves in a
 
03:22:03.870 --> 03:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
world of trouble and uh you know it's
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
one thing for an adult to make a
 
03:22:06.750 --> 03:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
decision you know I'm going to rent that
 
03:22:08.269 --> 03:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
Porsche I deserve it and then you know
 
03:22:09.950 --> 03:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
after six years of payments I really
 
03:22:12.070 --> 03:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
screwed up uh it's another thing when a
 
03:22:14.710 --> 03:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
17-year-old signs on the dotted line and
 
03:22:16.830 --> 03:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
at 45 years old says I wish wish I could
 
03:22:19.189 --> 03:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
afford a house
 
03:22:21.309 --> 03:22:21.319 align:start position:0%
someday other questions representative
 
03:22:27.510 --> 03:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank you um so am I correct
 
03:22:31.710 --> 03:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
that you see this bill as an effort at
 
03:22:35.229 --> 03:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
consumer protection 100% correct thank
 
03:22:37.710 --> 03:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
you uh could I follow up yes of course
 
03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
would you change your position at all
 
03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
you you began by uh making clear what
 
03:22:48.030 --> 03:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
political iCal party you belong to which
 
03:22:50.670 --> 03:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
I hadn't seen was relevant but perhaps
 
03:22:53.469 --> 03:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
it is relevant since on the national
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
level it appears that the national
 
03:23:00.229 --> 03:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
government the federal government um is
 
03:23:00.239 --> 03:23:01.870 align:start position:0%
government the federal government um is
um

03:23:01.870 --> 03:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh challenging the existence of the
 
03:23:09.030 --> 03:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
entire consumer protection effort would
 
03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
that change your position on this bill
 
03:23:14.269 --> 03:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
um so let me first say that the reason I
 
03:23:16.590 --> 03:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
introduced my own party was to say that
 
03:23:18.349 --> 03:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
I think that to some degree I'm arguing
 
03:23:20.830 --> 03:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
against interest as a lawyer would say
 
03:23:22.990 --> 03:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
which is you would expect in general it
 
03:23:24.750 --> 03:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
would be people on the left who tend to
 
03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of student loan
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
forgiveness and I just wanted to say
 
03:23:30.030 --> 03:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
that you know uh I'm a person you know
 
03:23:31.389 --> 03:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
who doesn't necessarily share all of
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
those cultural political Norms but still
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand the sort of financial tragedy
 
03:23:38.670 --> 03:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
that many people are in um and speaking
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
to uh changes at a federal level um you
 
03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
know obviously none of us in this room
 
03:23:45.269 --> 03:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
have any power at that level but the
 
03:23:46.469 --> 03:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
great thing about the Federal syst
 
03:23:48.150 --> 03:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
system is that there's the sort of you
 
03:23:50.550 --> 03:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
know the 50 Laboratories of democracy
 
03:23:53.070 --> 03:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
and we can make our own rules here and
 
03:23:55.309 --> 03:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're uh this bill to pass
 
03:23:56.990 --> 03:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
and were it to have both sort of
 
03:23:59.590 --> 03:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
retroactive applicability where you know
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
someone having already gotten a
 
03:24:02.830 --> 03:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
deceptively advertised degree gets
 
03:24:05.229 --> 03:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
Justice and in the future where because
 
03:24:06.830 --> 03:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
we said incentives future people are
 
03:24:08.910 --> 03:24:08.920 align:start position:0%
spared that danger um I would think that
 
03:24:10.030 --> 03:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
this could be something that could
 
03:24:12.349 --> 03:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps be replicated in other states so
 
03:24:13.830 --> 03:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
if you were worried that you know the
 
03:24:14.870 --> 03:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
country is heading in a certain
 
03:24:16.630 --> 03:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
direction and might not be heading back
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
for decades to come uh that these states
 
03:24:21.309 --> 03:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
can do a lot to achieve Justice for
 
03:24:21.319 --> 03:24:22.110 align:start position:0%
can do a lot to achieve Justice for
young

03:24:22.110 --> 03:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
young
 
03:24:25.269 --> 03:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
people and if could I just ask one could
 
03:24:27.309 --> 03:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
you show me where in the bill and maybe
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
I just haven't read it carefully enough
 
03:24:32.269 --> 03:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
it says that it would be
 
03:24:35.590 --> 03:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
retroactive um as soon as that word came
 
03:24:37.990 --> 03:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
out of my mouth I was immediately uh
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
upset with my word choice um I I did not
 
03:24:44.189 --> 03:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
intend to have that in there thank
 
03:24:47.750 --> 03:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
you other questions this
 
03:24:50.189 --> 03:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
witness so I guess I do have a question
 
03:24:54.790 --> 03:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
isn't even without this isn't the
 
03:24:57.710 --> 03:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
consume I mean if if there really has
 
03:25:00.830 --> 03:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
been an institution that
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
has um you know misrepresented the value
 
03:25:07.630 --> 03:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
of its educational programs isn't that
 
03:25:09.389 --> 03:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
covered already under the consumer
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
protection act thank you for the
 
03:25:13.990 --> 03:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
question um I believe it's not um and
 
03:25:15.790 --> 03:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
part of that is because what exactly do
 
03:25:18.189 --> 03:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
you mean by by misrepresentation and
 
03:25:21.429 --> 03:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
this again gets to power dynamics um you
 
03:25:24.710 --> 03:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
know if a university said sign up for
 
03:25:28.189 --> 03:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
our anthropology degree we guarantee you
 
03:25:30.750 --> 03:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
that this degree will pay for itself and
 
03:25:32.830 --> 03:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
it will be guaranteed entrance to the
 
03:25:34.269 --> 03:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
middle class where the middle class is
 
03:25:36.670 --> 03:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
defined as this income to that income uh
 
03:25:38.150 --> 03:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
then a student would you know have a
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
very strong case um but you know having
 
03:25:42.910 --> 03:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
gone through college myself at all times
 
03:25:44.830 --> 03:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
there's this you know welcome to a brand
 
03:25:46.510 --> 03:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
new world this is your pathway way to
 
03:25:48.070 --> 03:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
the future I mean Pathway to the future
 
03:25:49.830 --> 03:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
is the kind of language that's used all
 
03:25:51.790 --> 03:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
the time and you can't you know go to
 
03:25:54.269 --> 03:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
court and say but your honor the dean of
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
students said it was the pathway to the
 
03:25:57.389 --> 03:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
Future well you know it's now the year
 
03:26:01.349 --> 03:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
2029 congrats you're in the future um so
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know there has never been to my
 
03:26:06.429 --> 03:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
understanding any sort of case against
 
03:26:09.790 --> 03:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh universities um under existing law
 
03:26:12.510 --> 03:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
and yet universities under existing law
 
03:26:14.670 --> 03:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
continuously offer degrees that end up
 
03:26:16.429 --> 03:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
costing hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
and can never pay for
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
themselves other questions for this
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
sir thank you very much for your time
 
03:26:28.950 --> 03:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Lauren Banker
 
03:26:28.960 --> 03:27:00.070 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Lauren Banker
please

03:27:00.070 --> 03:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
03:27:04.590 --> 03:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
03:27:06.349 --> 03:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
Lauren Banker I serve as the Director of
 
03:27:08.309 --> 03:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
government relations for the University
 
03:27:10.950 --> 03:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh system of New Hampshire we are here
 
03:27:13.590 --> 03:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
today in opposition to House Bill
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
722 I just wanted to provide a few
 
03:27:15.840 --> 03:27:16.750 align:start position:0%
722 I just wanted to provide a few
points

03:27:16.750 --> 03:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
points
 
03:27:19.389 --> 03:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
um and then uh I'll say this is not an
 
03:27:21.070 --> 03:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
area that I have a lot of expertise in
 
03:27:22.750 --> 03:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
so if I can do some followup with my
 
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues back at our campuses I'm
 
03:27:27.710 --> 03:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
happy to do so uh I'll start by saying
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that affordability and accessibility are
 
03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
core values of our institutions and that
 
03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
we take great pride in providing
 
03:27:35.309 --> 03:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to each of our students and
 
03:27:36.910 --> 03:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
equipping them with the experiences
 
03:27:38.950 --> 03:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
Knowledge and Skills to thrive in their
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
career um but we while we appreciate the
 
03:27:43.950 --> 03:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor's goal uh we have several major
 
03:27:46.590 --> 03:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with the proposed legislation
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh I I'll hit on two things and then um
 
03:27:52.189 --> 03:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
you know the backside of uh my testimony
 
03:27:54.590 --> 03:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
has a a little bit more as well uh the
 
03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
first being that the bill would require
 
03:27:59.349 --> 03:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
detailed earnings data for graduated
 
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
students by degree program to determine
 
03:28:04.510 --> 03:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
the average annualized four-year pre-tax
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
inflation adjusted salary of grads of uh
 
03:28:10.309 --> 03:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
each of the degree programs we do not um
 
03:28:12.590 --> 03:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
and could not capture this sort of
 
03:28:14.670 --> 03:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
detailed earnings data for each of our
 
03:28:16.710 --> 03:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
graduates and that this
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
uh requisite level and completeness of
 
03:28:21.229 --> 03:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
earnings data is um information that
 
03:28:23.630 --> 03:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
would only be available through the um
 
03:28:26.790 --> 03:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
IRS we are currently working diligently
 
03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
to comply with recently enacted uh
 
03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations with regards to
 
03:28:33.229 --> 03:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
financial value transparency and gainful
 
03:28:35.830 --> 03:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
employment all of our institutions have
 
03:28:37.950 --> 03:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
recently I think as of January 15th
 
03:28:40.510 --> 03:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
submitted uh record level student data
 
03:28:42.110 --> 03:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
that will be matched with national
 
03:28:44.229 --> 03:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
student loan and IRS earnings data and
 
03:28:45.790 --> 03:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
this data is going to be analyzed and
 
03:28:48.870 --> 03:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
post Ed to a publicly facing website in
 
03:28:50.349 --> 03:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
order to provide students and families
 
03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
with a clear um comparable information
 
03:28:56.150 --> 03:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
about financial outcomes of educational
 
03:28:59.070 --> 03:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
programs um so above all you know this
 
03:29:00.750 --> 03:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
this work is being done on the federal
 
03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
level um that we are uh following all
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
the regulations and Reporting
 
03:29:07.150 --> 03:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
requirements we've been investing um
 
03:29:09.269 --> 03:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours to collect review
 
03:29:11.590 --> 03:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
analyze securely transmit Ure the
 
03:29:14.349 --> 03:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
accuracy of this data um as required by
 
03:29:17.189 --> 03:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
the federal legislation so ultimately
 
03:29:19.630 --> 03:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks is seeking to create a
 
03:29:21.830 --> 03:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
duplicative process and create
 
03:29:23.349 --> 03:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
additional and unnecessary
 
03:29:25.189 --> 03:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
administrative and financial burden on
 
03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
our institutions at a time where we're
 
03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
already facing significant financial
 
03:29:31.990 --> 03:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
constraints I'm happy to answer any
 
03:29:35.269 --> 03:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
questions um the committee thank you
 
03:29:37.070 --> 03:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Oregon and
 
03:29:38.910 --> 03:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
then representative um thank you very
 
03:29:42.110 --> 03:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
much isn't um is it fair to say that one
 
03:29:44.670 --> 03:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
extenda circumstance especially for
 
03:29:46.550 --> 03:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
major universities like un each is that
 
03:29:50.389 --> 03:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
they rely heavily on alumni donations so
 
03:29:51.910 --> 03:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
you do have an interest in making sure
 
03:29:54.910 --> 03:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
your alumni um earned earn enough money
 
03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
not just to pay off their loans but even
 
03:29:57.990 --> 03:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
have something left over for other
 
03:30:00.349 --> 03:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
things in life including uh including
 
03:30:02.469 --> 03:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
donating to their Alam mat yeah as an
 
03:30:04.349 --> 03:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
Alum of unh I definitely have that
 
03:30:07.150 --> 03:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
Affinity yeah thank you representative
 
03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much
 
03:30:14.150 --> 03:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm been I'm interested in this bill
 
03:30:17.150 --> 03:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm not sure
 
03:30:20.349 --> 03:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
were kind of Who's on First in terms of
 
03:30:22.269 --> 03:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's the University or whether
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
03:30:26.750 --> 03:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
lender not a grantor But A lender or
 
03:30:30.070 --> 03:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
whatever um so it's a little confusing
 
03:30:35.590 --> 03:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
to me but can you tell me when um a
 
03:30:35.600 --> 03:30:37.030 align:start position:0%
to me but can you tell me when um a
student

03:30:37.030 --> 03:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:30:39.229 --> 03:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
applies uh for
 
03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
whatever particular academic Pursuit um
 
03:30:47.950 --> 03:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
are they given um either a guarantee or
 
03:30:52.630 --> 03:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
a statement by the uh educational
 
03:30:56.269 --> 03:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
institution that if they enter such such
 
03:30:58.910 --> 03:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
a degree program they will be
 
03:31:00.750 --> 03:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
guaranteed a
 
03:31:04.269 --> 03:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
certain um income as a
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
result I don't know specifically what
 
03:31:08.830 --> 03:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
each of the campuses are doing with that
 
03:31:10.670 --> 03:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
regard but I'm happy to follow up with
 
03:31:12.309 --> 03:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
our career offices and see I know
 
03:31:15.189 --> 03:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of investment in
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
energy and sour into our career and
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
professional success uh offices at each
 
03:31:21.790 --> 03:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
of our campuses um so I know that this
 
03:31:24.030 --> 03:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
is something that they um value and I
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
can I'm happy to follow up could I
 
03:31:27.750 --> 03:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
repeat that question
 
03:31:32.429 --> 03:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
sure do you really mean to tell
 
03:31:36.550 --> 03:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
me that it's a possibility or a
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
probability that
 
03:31:38.640 --> 03:31:40.389 align:start position:0%
probability that
any

03:31:40.389 --> 03:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:31:42.670 --> 03:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
employee of a
 
03:31:47.229 --> 03:31:47.239 align:start position:0%
university will guarantee to to an
 
03:31:51.150 --> 03:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
applicant what their income will be if
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
they pursue a particular
 
03:31:56.790 --> 03:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
degree I don't I don't know I don't
 
03:31:59.590 --> 03:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
think so but I don't know thank you very
 
03:32:02.790 --> 03:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
much other questions for this
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:32:08.750 --> 03:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you next I'm going to call on uh
 
03:32:22.349 --> 03:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:24.189 --> 03:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairperson members of the
 
03:32:26.110 --> 03:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Brandon Gad I am a
 
03:32:28.349 --> 03:32:28.359 align:start position:0%
senior Assistant Attorney General I am
 
03:32:29.550 --> 03:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
also the chief of the consumer
 
03:32:31.349 --> 03:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
protection and any trust Bureau at the
 
03:32:34.110 --> 03:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Justice I am
 
03:32:36.349 --> 03:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
here before you neither in support nor
 
03:32:38.349 --> 03:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill I think that you
 
03:32:40.790 --> 03:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
know the merits behind this bill and the
 
03:32:43.269 --> 03:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
the cost of an education are a concern
 
03:32:44.710 --> 03:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
that is shared pretty much across the
 
03:32:46.670 --> 03:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
board by everybody
 
03:32:49.229 --> 03:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
um but as the chief of the consumer
 
03:32:51.269 --> 03:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
protection anti trust Bureau that will
 
03:32:53.469 --> 03:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
be responsible for enforcing the
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
provisions of the statute um I think
 
03:32:57.030 --> 03:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
that it's important that when
 
03:32:58.830 --> 03:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
considering this legislation that this
 
03:33:00.990 --> 03:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
committee U think about two important
 
03:33:04.429 --> 03:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
issues um one is enforceability and the
 
03:33:06.630 --> 03:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
other is practically the resources that
 
03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
it would take to implement what this um
 
03:33:12.550 --> 03:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill anticipates I'll start by noting
 
03:33:14.590 --> 03:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
that I do see that a request for a
 
03:33:16.950 --> 03:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was made and I apologize
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
that we did not provide one um as the
 
03:33:21.510 --> 03:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
consumer Chief all of the consumer
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
protection related fiscal notes are
 
03:33:24.670 --> 03:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
usually sent to me I did not see this
 
03:33:26.510 --> 03:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
one um this must have fallen through the
 
03:33:29.229 --> 03:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
cracks um so apologies for that but I
 
03:33:30.550 --> 03:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
think I can provide the information that
 
03:33:31.830 --> 03:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
would have been contained in a fiscal
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
note to the committee
 
03:33:35.950 --> 03:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
today um I don't often appear before
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
this committee usually the consumer
 
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
protection bills are in House Commerce
 
03:33:40.630 --> 03:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
so I thought it might be helpful to just
 
03:33:43.150 --> 03:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
give a general sense of If This Were
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
enacted um how our consumer Protection
 
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau gets information gets complaints
 
03:33:52.389 --> 03:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
and you know decides on investigative
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
and enforcement priorities we have a
 
03:33:56.830 --> 03:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
consumer protection hotline that is open
 
03:33:59.030 --> 03:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
5 days a week it is manned by volunteers
 
03:34:00.710 --> 03:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
anybody can call in and speak to a real
 
03:34:02.189 --> 03:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
person who believes they are have an
 
03:34:03.910 --> 03:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
issue that you know may be a violation
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection act or may be
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
something that any member of the
 
03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice might be able to
 
03:34:10.950 --> 03:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
help with um the majority of those folks
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
who identify plausible consumer
 
03:34:15.189 --> 03:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
protection violations are steered
 
03:34:17.229 --> 03:34:17.239 align:start position:0%
towards fing a Consumer complaint in
 
03:34:19.469 --> 03:34:19.479 align:start position:0%
writing with the bureau I review every
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
one of those complaints and for those
 
03:34:23.189 --> 03:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
complaints that have any semblance of
 
03:34:25.950 --> 03:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
Merit um based on a possible violation
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
of our statute we send them to the
 
03:34:28.950 --> 03:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
business and we ask the business to
 
03:34:32.429 --> 03:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
respond in writing many businesses do um
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
and many businesses resolve those
 
03:34:36.110 --> 03:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
complaints by responding in that way um
 
03:34:37.510 --> 03:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
for the ones that don't or the ones that
 
03:34:41.309 --> 03:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
don't in a satisfactory way um we have
 
03:34:42.830 --> 03:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
the discretion to open a larger
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
investigation issue subpoenas talk to
 
03:34:47.349 --> 03:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and if we build a case that an
 
03:34:49.670 --> 03:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
unfair deceptive actor practice exists
 
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
and has been committed we have the
 
03:34:54.110 --> 03:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
ability to pursue both criminal charges
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
if appropriate or to bring a civil
 
03:34:58.189 --> 03:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement action to enjoin the conduct
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
and seek fines and restitution against
 
03:35:03.189 --> 03:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
the offending business so you know I I
 
03:35:04.590 --> 03:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
think that's important context to
 
03:35:05.550 --> 03:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
understand because the you know the
 
03:35:08.070 --> 03:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor is not wrong to say that this
 
03:35:10.030 --> 03:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
does not require the Attorney General
 
03:35:12.309 --> 03:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
office to do anything under this bill
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
but anytime you're adding to the
 
03:35:16.429 --> 03:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act which is
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
enforced certain parts of it are
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
enforced exclusively by the Consumer
 
03:35:21.309 --> 03:35:21.319 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau of the Attorney
 
03:35:23.910 --> 03:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
General's office it creates a perfectly
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
Fair expectation amongst consumers in
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
the states that if they are the victim
 
03:35:31.269 --> 03:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
and have been wronged by unfair
 
03:35:32.870 --> 03:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
deceptive actor practice that they can
 
03:35:34.830 --> 03:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
turn to the Attorney General's office
 
03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
who will take their complaint seriously
 
03:35:38.229 --> 03:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
investigate it and if appropriate bring
 
03:35:40.830 --> 03:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
an enforcement action so you know that
 
03:35:42.670 --> 03:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
discretion of whether or not to proceed
 
03:35:46.349 --> 03:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
exists across the board um but anytime a
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
bill is passed that entrusts us to
 
03:35:51.790 --> 03:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
enforce any new provision of consumer
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
rights in the state we want to make sure
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
that it's passed in a way where we can
 
03:35:57.229 --> 03:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
actually do it if there are complaints
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
and if there are violations that we can
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
provide meaningful enforcement of that
 
03:36:03.510 --> 03:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
statute otherwise it's mostly just for
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
show uh and I think there are real
 
03:36:07.630 --> 03:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
problems here and the the first part of
 
03:36:09.150 --> 03:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
it comes with you know I think that you
 
03:36:10.229 --> 03:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
know some of the comments that were
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
submitted by the university system of
 
03:36:14.110 --> 03:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's significant
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
resources that would be needed at a
 
03:36:19.229 --> 03:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
minimum just to allow the universities
 
03:36:21.150 --> 03:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
themselves to be able to compile the
 
03:36:23.349 --> 03:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
data that we could then you know either
 
03:36:25.670 --> 03:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
subpena or request and review in order
 
03:36:27.990 --> 03:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not the the
 
03:36:30.510 --> 03:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
amount being charged is in excess or in
 
03:36:31.830 --> 03:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
line with the threshold that's created
 
03:36:33.790 --> 03:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
by the statute so unless those resources
 
03:36:35.910 --> 03:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
are allocated and the universities are
 
03:36:37.550 --> 03:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
able to meaningfully put this data
 
03:36:40.910 --> 03:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
together we would be left to either um
 
03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
do that work ourselves which we are not
 
03:36:46.150 --> 03:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
in a position to do or to be left unable
 
03:36:47.469 --> 03:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
to enforce the statute because we
 
03:36:49.870 --> 03:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to determine um whether
 
03:36:52.710 --> 03:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
or not the you know average tuition as
 
03:36:55.189 --> 03:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
anticipated by the statute is or is not
 
03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
in excess of the threshold that was
 
03:37:00.550 --> 03:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
created um if those resources were
 
03:37:02.150 --> 03:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
allocated such that the universities
 
03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
could provide those numbers it would
 
03:37:06.070 --> 03:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
still require significant additional
 
03:37:07.590 --> 03:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
resources at the Attorney General's
 
03:37:09.189 --> 03:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
office to meaningfully enforce the
 
03:37:11.790 --> 03:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
statute um the consumer protection and
 
03:37:14.269 --> 03:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau is enforced with
 
03:37:16.429 --> 03:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
enforcing all of the consumer protection
 
03:37:18.389 --> 03:37:18.399 align:start position:0%
and antitrust statutes in the state
 
03:37:20.830 --> 03:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
which was recently expanded to include
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
um data privacy we're also tasked with
 
03:37:25.150 --> 03:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
um registering all the health clubs in
 
03:37:27.229 --> 03:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
the state all the Condominiums land
 
03:37:31.229 --> 03:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
sales um enforcing the state's tobacco
 
03:37:33.510 --> 03:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh related statutes and investigating
 
03:37:34.990 --> 03:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
and Prosecuting the most serious cases
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
of finan uh Elder Financial abuse and
 
03:37:39.750 --> 03:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
exploitation just to name a few and we
 
03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
regularly hit above our weight in terms
 
03:37:43.469 --> 03:37:43.479 align:start position:0%
of the resources that we have and all
 
03:37:45.590 --> 03:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
the things that we are expected to do
 
03:37:47.070 --> 03:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
think we do the best with what we can
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
and we get meaningful results for
 
03:37:50.750 --> 03:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
consumers but this would be a
 
03:37:52.990 --> 03:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
significant expansion um that would
 
03:37:56.269 --> 03:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
create a 10year right for every single
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
graduate in the state to file a
 
03:38:00.750 --> 03:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
complaint um with the AG's office and it
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
just review those complaints and
 
03:38:04.429 --> 03:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
meaningfully investigating issuing
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
subpoenas reviewing the documents that
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
would come in response to those
 
03:38:09.630 --> 03:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
subpoenas doing a meaningful calculus to
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not the tuition
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
being charged is or is not in excess of
 
03:38:16.110 --> 03:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
the threshold anticipated by the statute
 
03:38:18.030 --> 03:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
would require additional resources
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
probably in the realm of three
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
additional employees in order to
 
03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
meaningfully do this um in the way that
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
is anticipated by this
 
03:38:30.429 --> 03:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
statute um I think the chairperson asked
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
a good question earlier which was you
 
03:38:35.110 --> 03:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
know is this already covered and I I
 
03:38:37.670 --> 03:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
think that it is to the extent that any
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
University is making any sort of claims
 
03:38:43.469 --> 03:38:43.479 align:start position:0%
about what income you will receive or
 
03:38:45.550 --> 03:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
can expect to receive unless it is is
 
03:38:47.790 --> 03:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
firmly supported by statistics that they
 
03:38:50.189 --> 03:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
can support and guarantee for you know
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
those folks that are enrolling in their
 
03:38:53.229 --> 03:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
program there's obviously a number of
 
03:38:55.710 --> 03:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
variables uh including you know how
 
03:38:57.150 --> 03:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
successful the student is in their
 
03:38:58.950 --> 03:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
coursework what you know jobs they
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately pursue what internships they
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
pursue um that determine you know the
 
03:39:04.950 --> 03:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
amount of income that that people can
 
03:39:06.269 --> 03:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
get so I think because of that
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
universities more likely than not are
 
03:39:10.070 --> 03:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
very unlikely to make those sorts of
 
03:39:12.070 --> 03:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
representations but it has happened in
 
03:39:15.030 --> 03:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
the past um the there were several four
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
profit colleges including IT Tech um
 
03:39:19.309 --> 03:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
that were making those types of
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
representations to students essentially
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing a certain level of income
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
if they were to complete their programs
 
03:39:28.150 --> 03:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
and those um colleges were jointly
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
investigated by uh the New Hampshire
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office as well as the
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
majority of the Attorney General's
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
offices across the country um and were
 
03:39:37.710 --> 03:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
offer and were required to pay
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
significant fines and stop their
 
03:39:41.910 --> 03:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
practices so to the extent specific
 
03:39:43.630 --> 03:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
representations about the amount that
 
03:39:45.469 --> 03:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
you can expect to earn are being made
 
03:39:48.189 --> 03:39:48.199 align:start position:0%
are not true um that would be an unfair
 
03:39:49.870 --> 03:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
and deceptive actor practice under our
 
03:39:51.670 --> 03:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
existing statute even though it's not a
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
specifically delineated unfair and
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
deceptive actor practice so I I think
 
03:39:57.990 --> 03:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's all the testimony that I have
 
03:39:59.469 --> 03:39:59.479 align:start position:0%
today I'm happy to take questions if
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
there are any question representative
 
03:40:06.269 --> 03:40:06.279 align:start position:0%
Horgan and um see do you and do you feel
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
what do you feel about the fact that
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
um universities don't really have the
 
03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
well they don't really have the capacity
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
to control what Life Choices they uh
 
03:40:17.950 --> 03:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
their graduates make after you know
 
03:40:21.229 --> 03:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
after they get out of school and also um
 
03:40:23.150 --> 03:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
so people often make Life Choices you
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
know they may get a degree for a
 
03:40:26.670 --> 03:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
high-paying uh job and then decide some
 
03:40:28.269 --> 03:40:28.279 align:start position:0%
other type of work interest them that
 
03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
applies for example to all of us around
 
03:40:31.469 --> 03:40:31.479 align:start position:0%
the table we're making $100 a year as a
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
State Rep but um and also what about
 
03:40:37.590 --> 03:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
things that are not voluntary people
 
03:40:39.469 --> 03:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
like sometimes you know some people
 
03:40:41.830 --> 03:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately then acquire chronic
 
03:40:44.269 --> 03:40:44.279 align:start position:0%
illnesses and they can't do the high
 
03:40:45.950 --> 03:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
paying job they were trained for and
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of other circumstances
 
03:40:50.710 --> 03:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
so well what sort difficulties you think
 
03:40:52.269 --> 03:40:52.279 align:start position:0%
the bill poses in that regard that
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
they're ask universities to be liable
 
03:40:56.750 --> 03:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
for for things that aren't under their
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
control so without getting at the merits
 
03:41:02.309 --> 03:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill I do think that the issues
 
03:41:03.910 --> 03:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
you've raised highlight some of the
 
03:41:05.150 --> 03:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
difficulties that we would have in
 
03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement um all of that would need to
 
03:41:08.910 --> 03:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
be considered and all of that would need
 
03:41:10.389 --> 03:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
to be calculated in order to
 
03:41:13.070 --> 03:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
meaningfully determine whether or not a
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
college or a university was in violation
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
of the statute so I I think that you
 
03:41:19.349 --> 03:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
know th those are certainly concerns and
 
03:41:21.229 --> 03:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
they they go right to I believe our
 
03:41:23.429 --> 03:41:23.439 align:start position:0%
ability to meaningfully enforce this and
 
03:41:24.790 --> 03:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
gather all the data that would be
 
03:41:27.030 --> 03:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
necessary to truly determine whether or
 
03:41:29.110 --> 03:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
not tuition is excessive or not or
 
03:41:31.309 --> 03:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
unreasonable or not under this
 
03:41:34.550 --> 03:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
statute other questions for this
 
03:41:36.910 --> 03:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
witness seeing wh I'm sorry
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
representative B thank you Mr chair and
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
I do appreciate in advance I was curious
 
03:41:43.790 --> 03:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
because I
 
03:41:48.070 --> 03:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
know five years ago when Betsy DeVos was
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
actually in DC I was um for the
 
03:41:53.790 --> 03:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I was really
 
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
curious because I know that there were a
 
03:41:55.680 --> 03:41:57.269 align:start position:0%
curious because I know that there were a
lot

03:41:57.269 --> 03:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
lot
 
03:42:00.510 --> 03:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
of colleges capella people like that
 
03:42:02.149 --> 03:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
that were
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
actually making a few offers that they
 
03:42:06.990 --> 03:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't but I just know that
 
03:42:08.910 --> 03:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
that was s supported from the Department
 
03:42:13.229 --> 03:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
of Education at the time so I guess do
 
03:42:16.590 --> 03:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
you see any of kind of like that
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
involving with this at all I could you
 
03:42:21.070 --> 03:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
be more specific as to what you're
 
03:42:23.389 --> 03:42:23.399 align:start position:0%
referring to it's like GI bills things
 
03:42:25.870 --> 03:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
like that where colleges took advantage
 
03:42:30.510 --> 03:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
of you know the the uh education funds
 
03:42:32.790 --> 03:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
that vets
 
03:42:35.590 --> 03:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
have I'm not sure how much overlap there
 
03:42:38.110 --> 03:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
would be there this is strictly about
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
the cost of tuition for a specific um
 
03:42:43.189 --> 03:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
degree program
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I suppose that could impact it one
 
03:42:47.429 --> 03:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
way or another I mean there were there
 
03:42:49.710 --> 03:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
are a number of factors that could
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
influence the both the you know price
 
03:42:54.149 --> 03:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
that a university charges but then
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately what the average salary based

exitor Rockingham 11 I'm here to
introduce

04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
04:41:04.590 --> 04:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
762 on behalf of Representative Zoe
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
Manos who's ill today I am also a
 
04:41:11.550 --> 04:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to enable the
 
04:41:17.788 --> 04:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to hire an independent
 
04:41:21.708 --> 04:41:21.718 align:start position:0%
contractor to conduct a manual review of
 
04:41:25.230 --> 04:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
domestic violence stalking cases and
 
04:41:29.150 --> 04:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
related criminal cases to compile and
 
04:41:33.550 --> 04:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
collate data for statistical analysis by
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
the judicial
 
04:41:39.430 --> 04:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
branch it authorizes an appropriation of
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
$30,000 to do this
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
without proper data it is impossible to
 
04:41:48.390 --> 04:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
determine where and what resources are
 
04:41:51.750 --> 04:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
needed in domestic violence in stalking
 
04:41:55.150 --> 04:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
cases and related criminal cases within
 
04:41:58.750 --> 04:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
branch right now the judicial branch
 
04:42:04.430 --> 04:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
only keeps records in domestic violence
 
04:42:09.070 --> 04:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
and stalking cases on paper in paper
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
files there is no electronic filing in
 
04:42:16.510 --> 04:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
these cases and no coordination with
 
04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
related criminal
 
04:42:21.628 --> 04:42:21.638 align:start position:0%
cases is very
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
limited the circuit courts cannot see
 
04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
data across the cases or the country or
 
04:42:31.948 --> 04:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
Statewide in order to determine and
 
04:42:35.590 --> 04:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
evaluate what resources are necessary
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
the first step is to gather data and
 
04:42:42.510 --> 04:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
that means manually reviewing the paper
 
04:42:46.350 --> 04:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
case files to gather the data this bill
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
will enable the judicial branch to hire
 
04:42:53.190 --> 04:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
an independent contractor to do this
 
04:42:56.030 --> 04:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's important to emphasize that no
 
04:42:56.040 --> 04:42:57.430 align:start position:0%
it's important to emphasize that no
personal

04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
personal
 
04:43:00.430 --> 04:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
information that identifies any party
 
04:43:03.550 --> 04:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
will be gathered or
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
recorded the data is used for
 
04:43:09.470 --> 04:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis
 
04:43:12.310 --> 04:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
only the bill recognizes that the
 
04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
judicial branch may be able to secure
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
funding from other
 
04:43:20.350 --> 04:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
sources if so those funds would be
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
applied prior to this
 
04:43:27.070 --> 04:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation it is critically important
 
04:43:30.270 --> 04:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
that we collect this data it will enable
 
04:43:32.788 --> 04:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
us to determine what additional
 
04:43:35.830 --> 04:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
resources are needed by the judicial
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
branch in domestic violence and stocking
 
04:43:39.560 --> 04:43:41.270 align:start position:0%
branch in domestic violence and stocking
cases

04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:43:44.590 --> 04:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
and related criminal cases it will also
 
04:43:47.430 --> 04:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
enable us to determine what additional
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
resources are needed to support victims
 
04:43:54.510 --> 04:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
and what resources are needed to allow
 
04:43:57.868 --> 04:43:57.878 align:start position:0%
perpetrators to address their
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%

working my notes anyways um I have a
 
04:45:54.910 --> 04:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
family case um 630 2020 dm42 that's my
 
04:46:00.430 --> 04:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
family case um it relates to uh a
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
criminal case where where my ex had
 
04:46:05.708 --> 04:46:05.718 align:start position:0%
assaulted me and was criminally arrested
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
in 2017 that's 4 uh 64 2017 CR 430 uh
 
04:46:13.150 --> 04:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
where she was arrested for simple
 
04:46:16.750 --> 04:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
assault criminal uh charges uh were
 
04:46:19.590 --> 04:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
brought up and we had those dismissed
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then we started our family case in
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
2020 and in
 
04:46:29.788 --> 04:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
2022 she got a bogus DV stating that uh
 
04:46:32.628 --> 04:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh the 2017 incident was me hitting her
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
even though it's documented uh that's
 
04:46:38.548 --> 04:46:38.558 align:start position:0%
case number 630 2022
 
04:46:41.548 --> 04:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
dv21 uh and and after watching um
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
witnessing my son get assaulted and
 
04:46:46.070 --> 04:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
attacked on numerous occasions called
 
04:46:47.310 --> 04:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
for welfare
 
04:46:50.590 --> 04:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
checks um and I reached out to the
 
04:46:53.350 --> 04:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
firstes line of communication between a
 
04:46:54.830 --> 04:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
parent and their child as the other
 
04:46:57.868 --> 04:46:57.878 align:start position:0%
parent I was inheld criminally on
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
several charges so you know sir I I I
 
04:47:03.030 --> 04:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm I'm really trying to under
 
04:47:06.910 --> 04:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
you know what is all the the details of
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
some particular case have to do with
 
04:47:10.868 --> 04:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
this well I disagree with this bill
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
especially if it's not going to
 
04:47:14.670 --> 04:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
pronounce names to spend $30,000 when
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
when Gordon McDonald had just said that
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know there's not enough money for a
 
04:47:21.110 --> 04:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
trial okay so these three criminal cases
 
04:47:23.110 --> 04:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
two of them were simply calling the
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
police department for a welfare check
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
they held me for third party
 
04:47:29.470 --> 04:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
communication 60 days without bail and
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
when I asked for a denovo hearing in
 
04:47:32.470 --> 04:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
front of a
 
04:47:34.750 --> 04:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
jury they were told me that I would have
 
04:47:36.990 --> 04:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
to remain in preventative detention and
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
told that trial these were bogus cases
 
04:47:41.788 --> 04:47:41.798 align:start position:0%
all related to family court all related
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
to DV uh domestic violence where she was
 
04:47:47.548 --> 04:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
the one assaulted me and then later on
 
04:47:49.150 --> 04:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
even though I had evidence at the
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
hearing the judge didn't want to see it
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
and I was then
 
04:47:56.150 --> 04:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
held uh they gave a final DV order in
 
04:47:57.948 --> 04:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
the family case where there was already
 
04:48:00.190 --> 04:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
problems communicating and when I
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
reached out to protect my own son I was
 
04:48:06.430 --> 04:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
then arrested and held without bail and
 
04:48:09.110 --> 04:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
when I when I was tried maliciously
 
04:48:11.670 --> 04:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
tried and asked for denovo hearing at
 
04:48:14.350 --> 04:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
Superior Court they gave me a new bail
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
hearing the circuit court and said that
 
04:48:20.270 --> 04:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
if I wanted to have a jury
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
trial then I would have to remain this
 
04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
was the day of my release I had already
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
served my sentence I would have to
 
04:48:27.120 --> 04:48:28.230 align:start position:0%
served my sentence I would have to
remain

04:48:28.230 --> 04:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
remain
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
incarcerated unless I
 
04:48:32.548 --> 04:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
withdraw so I don't understand why you
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
would want to spend
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
$330,000 on anybody investigating
 
04:48:40.070 --> 04:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
especially if you guys have the power to
 
04:48:43.150 --> 04:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
subpoena and possibly impeach any of
 
04:48:45.670 --> 04:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
those Bad actors that have kept my son
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
In Harm's Way for five years when I I
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
was retaliated against through the
 
04:48:52.350 --> 04:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
family court it was the same judge in
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
her criminal case in 2017 the same judge
 
04:48:57.430 --> 04:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
in the DV case and the same judge in all
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
three criminal cases that were all
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
brought on on allegations alone I don't
 
04:49:04.150 --> 04:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
understand why you want anybody to
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
investigate you can investigate my case
 
04:49:07.948 --> 04:49:07.958 align:start position:0%
I'll give you this paper you can
 
04:49:09.628 --> 04:49:09.638 align:start position:0%
investigate the case with Joe Nan
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
Stephanie Turon Lind Smith Destiny
 
04:49:14.110 --> 04:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
Bernard Harmony Harmony Montgomery
 
04:49:16.030 --> 04:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
rugerio and rerio you must know that
 
04:49:18.990 --> 04:49:19.000 align:start position:0%

hogwash so there's plenty right here on
 
04:49:30.030 --> 04:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
this one page for this body if you want
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
it you don't have to investigate you
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to go far we we can just we
 
04:49:36.390 --> 04:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
can just decide to impeach those judges
 
04:49:38.350 --> 04:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
no what I'm saying is there's plenty to
 
04:49:39.948 --> 04:49:39.958 align:start position:0%
investigate right here without spending
 
04:49:39.958 --> 04:49:41.350 align:start position:0%

Hampshire uh and you should have three
 
04:50:54.070 --> 04:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
handouts uh one is an uh just a summary
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
of an email I sent everyone this morning
 
04:51:00.510 --> 04:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
it has a large number of
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
attachments uh no need to kill trees but
 
04:51:06.470 --> 04:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
you've got a complete record there uh
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
electronically of the current
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
proceedings that the judicial branch is
 
04:51:12.390 --> 04:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
done under Justice
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
Marone uh to address domestic violence
 
04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
so there was a lot of Prior work on this
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
by Justice
 
04:51:24.350 --> 04:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
Marone uh you've got uh in terms of uh
 
04:51:27.270 --> 04:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
budgeting the uh presentation by the
 
04:51:31.628 --> 04:51:31.638 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice to the uh Joint Committee
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
of Judiciary and children and family law
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh so that's all pretty relevant to
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
budgeting on this and uh you've also got
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
one federal court case that I think is
 
04:51:43.600 --> 04:51:45.430 align:start position:0%
one federal court case that I think is
relevant

04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
just excuse me uh I'll find it when I
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
come back to it uh it's Kell ve New
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in District Federal District
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
Court New
 
04:51:59.120 --> 04:52:02.548 align:start position:0%
Court New
Hampshire

04:52:02.548 --> 04:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so uh when I kind of tried to figure
 
04:52:09.270 --> 04:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
out what's going on in these cases the
 
04:52:12.030 --> 04:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
judicial branch I requested training
 
04:52:14.628 --> 04:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
materials uh that's one of the handouts
 
04:52:16.830 --> 04:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
and apparently this is a huge deal
 
04:52:21.350 --> 04:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
because General counil KGAN said that uh
 
04:52:24.430 --> 04:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
in June of 2023 domestic violence con
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
topics constituted the bulk of the
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
training for Circuit Court judges with
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
three full days devoted to the topics
 
04:52:33.990 --> 04:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
for recently appointed judges and a full
 
04:52:36.270 --> 04:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
day for other judges so we seem to be
 
04:52:38.350 --> 04:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
spending a whole lot of money on this
 
04:52:41.070 --> 04:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
with extremely little transparency
 
04:52:43.548 --> 04:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
on how it's actually being spent how
 
04:52:45.470 --> 04:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
these judges are actually being
 
04:52:50.470 --> 04:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
trained and uh that's particularly
 
04:52:53.190 --> 04:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
concerning you know when other
 
04:52:55.868 --> 04:52:55.878 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions like over in the fifth
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
circuit uh the federal appell at court
 
04:53:01.430 --> 04:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
there is made very clear that these
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
kinds of orders are essentially uh
 
04:53:06.788 --> 04:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
granted to whoever shows up to court
 
04:53:12.670 --> 04:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.190 --> 04:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um we already know that um
 
04:53:18.628 --> 04:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
they're granted against people like
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
David lutman because somebody was afraid
 
04:53:23.548 --> 04:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
of them on TV we know that uh they're
 
04:53:26.948 --> 04:53:26.958 align:start position:0%
granted whoever goes down to court first
 
04:53:29.150 --> 04:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
the fifth circuit specifically
 
04:53:31.708 --> 04:53:31.718 align:start position:0%
referenced training materials in its
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
opinion and that these training
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
materials are the problem and if you
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
know this body or we the people can't
 
04:53:41.430 --> 04:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
even see these train materials why
 
04:53:44.750 --> 04:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
should we be throwing
 
04:53:44.760 --> 04:53:47.110 align:start position:0%
should we be throwing
$30,000

04:53:47.110 --> 04:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
$30,000
 
04:53:50.830 --> 04:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
um uh none of these re Lindsay Smith
 
04:53:52.590 --> 04:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
who's the domestic violent shooting
 
04:53:54.830 --> 04:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
victim who was brutally shot after
 
04:53:57.548 --> 04:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
paully Hall denied a restraining order
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't gotten a single penny from the
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
state maybe she deserves some resources
 
04:54:07.150 --> 04:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
and not the judicial branch um maybe we
 
04:54:08.910 --> 04:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
should devote resources towards jury
 
04:54:08.920 --> 04:54:10.628 align:start position:0%
should devote resources towards jury
trials

04:54:10.628 --> 04:54:10.638 align:start position:0%
trials
 
04:54:13.310 --> 04:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
um Miss Smith's closest one of her
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
closest friends Miss Destiny barard was
 
04:54:18.470 --> 04:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
also incarcerated in preventative
 
04:54:21.190 --> 04:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
detention for three days no right to a
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
jury trial no access to
 
04:54:26.470 --> 04:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
counsel um you know once again because
 
04:54:28.708 --> 04:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
of this phenomena of whoever goes down
 
04:54:31.350 --> 04:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
to court first in this so-called civil
 
04:54:34.590 --> 04:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding automatically gets the order
 
04:54:39.470 --> 04:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
so the statute itself 173b is it's an
 
04:54:42.390 --> 04:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
Unholy am allegation of civil and
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
criminal law where the respondent uh is
 
04:54:47.590 --> 04:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
subject to all the penalties of the
 
04:54:50.590 --> 04:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system and has none of
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
the rights normally afforded criminal
 
04:54:55.470 --> 04:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
def defendants in the criminal justice
 
04:54:58.830 --> 04:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
system there's a de facto
 
04:55:02.628 --> 04:55:02.638 align:start position:0%
practice uh where the plaintiff in the
 
04:55:07.390 --> 04:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
so-called alleged civil 173b cases uh is
 
04:55:10.948 --> 04:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
essentially presumed to be correct
 
04:55:14.708 --> 04:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh unless the uh responded again in a
 
04:55:19.350 --> 04:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
soall civil case after the fact uh
 
04:55:21.350 --> 04:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
manages to prove Beyond a reasonable
 
04:55:23.470 --> 04:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
doubt they're innocent this is a
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
complete reversal of traditional
 
04:55:28.350 --> 04:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
American jurist
 
04:55:31.548 --> 04:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
Prudence uh you're putting domestic
 
04:55:34.750 --> 04:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
violent victims in jail now in
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
preventative detention solely because
 
04:55:39.150 --> 04:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
their abusers were the ones who went to
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
court first
 
04:55:44.830 --> 04:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
and you want to spend 3,00 $30,000 to
 
04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
study more of the same when you know
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
Justice Marone has already been all over
 
04:55:53.628 --> 04:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
it with 10 meetings we've got 15
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
meetings at the governor's commission
 
04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
and nothing's come with that so I really
 
04:56:01.150 --> 04:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
question what we hope to get for this
 
04:56:03.868 --> 04:56:03.878 align:start position:0%
$330,000 when is you know Mr Kenny the
 
04:56:06.150 --> 04:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
prior speaker said so many people have
 
04:56:08.910 --> 04:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
shown up to testify and can give you all
 
04:56:11.390 --> 04:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
the problem docket so I would propose we
 
04:56:14.548 --> 04:56:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh either itl this or we replace it with
 
04:56:16.510 --> 04:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of investigatory study
 
04:56:19.230 --> 04:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
committee in the legislature to really
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
address you know the constitutionality
 
04:56:21.840 --> 04:56:22.628 align:start position:0%
address you know the constitutionality
of

04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
173b you know otherwise like the federal
 
04:56:29.230 --> 04:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
court opinion passed out you know right
 
04:56:31.390 --> 04:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
now we have people starting to challenge
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
you know those statutes in federal court
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
and I would only anticipate that's going
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
to continue as we go further and further
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
downhill putting innocent people in jail
 
04:56:45.548 --> 04:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
in preventative detention with no right
 
04:56:48.590 --> 04:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
to a jury trial just because they're Dev
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
victims and their abusers made it to
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
court first with that said I'll take
 
04:56:55.390 --> 04:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this
 
04:56:57.670 --> 04:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
sir thank you next I'll call on Aaron
 
04:57:11.628 --> 04:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon afternoon Erin krian
 
04:57:16.030 --> 04:57:16.040 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the judicial branch
 
04:57:18.190 --> 04:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
um just coming to discuss this bill
 
04:57:20.230 --> 04:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
which I really appreciated that um
 
04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative Manos reached out to us
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
and and had a general question what was
 
04:57:27.190 --> 04:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
the best way to get answers to specific
 
04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
factual questions and I think she's
 
04:57:30.430 --> 04:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
still working with stakeholders on what
 
04:57:32.708 --> 04:57:32.718 align:start position:0%
she wants those questions to be that
 
04:57:34.948 --> 04:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
would be fact dependent in order to show
 
04:57:36.910 --> 04:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
how common or uncommon certain factual
 
04:57:39.548 --> 04:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
characteristics are in DB cases um I
 
04:57:40.750 --> 04:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that list from her I know
 
04:57:42.430 --> 04:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
she's working on it but we we had a
 
04:57:43.948 --> 04:57:43.958 align:start position:0%
chance to engage with her about
 
04:57:45.430 --> 04:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
potentially the best way to do that
 
04:57:47.708 --> 04:57:47.718 align:start position:0%
which is because over 95% of these cases
 
04:57:49.948 --> 04:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
are in paper they it it typically
 
04:57:52.350 --> 04:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
involves a human going and looking
 
04:57:54.548 --> 04:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
through the paper for certain
 
04:57:57.190 --> 04:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
characteristics um so for example I
 
04:57:58.270 --> 04:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
think she had said something at one
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
point to me about how many children
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
under a certain age involved we would
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
have to review that manually from the
 
04:58:06.670 --> 04:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
record uh so that's that I think this is
 
04:58:08.510 --> 04:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
the correct way to to do that if it is
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
what the legislature would like to do
 
04:58:12.030 --> 04:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate her collaboration and
 
04:58:13.948 --> 04:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
work to kind of do it in a way that was
 
04:58:16.270 --> 04:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
something that we could action it is
 
04:58:18.310 --> 04:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely up to the legislature whether
 
04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
to appropriate this money for this
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
purpose but um I do know that this is a
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
source of enduring questions that we
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
have people want to learn more about the
 
04:58:28.990 --> 04:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
features of different DB cases so I do
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
think there is a demand um should it be
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
your desire to fund it uh but I'm I'm
 
04:58:36.910 --> 04:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
not aware that there is any other way
 
04:58:39.110 --> 04:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
besides an actual manual review of the
 
04:58:40.548 --> 04:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
paper that we could get the level of
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
detail that people have been seeking of
 
04:58:46.270 --> 04:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
cases right great questions for this yes
 
04:58:46.280 --> 04:58:47.390 align:start position:0%
cases right great questions for this yes
representative

04:58:47.390 --> 04:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:58:50.230 --> 04:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
trip uh thank you for taking my question
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
I I know you're not the uh sponsor of
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
the bill but you seem to have been
 
04:58:57.510 --> 04:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
involved in uh the writing of it and uh
 
04:59:00.628 --> 04:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I'm interested in
 
04:59:04.150 --> 04:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh what the use of the uh or who's going
 
04:59:06.270 --> 04:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
to be using this data because it it
 
04:59:09.670 --> 04:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
talks about the the judicial B judicial
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
branch governance Commission on domestic
 
04:59:15.350 --> 04:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
violence sexual assault stalking and
 
04:59:18.788 --> 04:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
other interested individuals or persons
 
04:59:21.310 --> 04:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
you know uh do you have any idea who the
 
04:59:24.708 --> 04:59:24.718 align:start position:0%
other interested persons might be I
 
04:59:27.670 --> 04:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
don't but I suspect it would be those
 
04:59:29.390 --> 04:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
that are involved in the space so
 
04:59:30.628 --> 04:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
thought leaders people who work at
 
04:59:32.230 --> 04:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofits people who are maybe
 
04:59:33.628 --> 04:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
Affiliated in a loose way with the
 
04:59:36.190 --> 04:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
Coalition on domestic violence um I
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
would expect that it would be folks that
 
04:59:39.190 --> 04:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
typically appear at meetings on this
 
04:59:39.200 --> 04:59:41.270 align:start position:0%
typically appear at meetings on this
subject

04:59:41.270 --> 04:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
subject
 
04:59:45.150 --> 04:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
um so I I would uh assume that the data
 
04:59:47.390 --> 04:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
that's collected during this time would
 
04:59:49.390 --> 04:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
be uh published
 
04:59:51.628 --> 04:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
somewhere my expectation is that we
 
04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
would publish it in a report that would
 
04:59:54.590 --> 04:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
be available on the website because this
 
04:59:58.750 --> 04:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
would be statistical data how often um
 
05:00:00.270 --> 05:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
are young children involved how often
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
are certain facts present it would not
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
reveal any individual person's private
 
05:00:07.510 --> 05:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
information uh so it would be answering
 
05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
questions that that people sometimes
 
05:00:10.590 --> 05:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
have about how common certain factual
 
05:00:12.868 --> 05:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
characteristics are in DV
 
05:00:18.390 --> 05:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
cases yep go ahead one more uh do you
 
05:00:21.548 --> 05:00:21.558 align:start position:0%
have any idea of how many years this
 
05:00:24.270 --> 05:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
review would cover I believe that that
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
was intentionally left vague because of
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have the questions so if we
 
05:00:29.948 --> 05:00:29.958 align:start position:0%
receive a very large set of questions
 
05:00:32.190 --> 05:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
$30,000 may only go back a few years if
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
we receive a small set of questions we
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
may be able to go relatively far back in
 
05:00:39.150 --> 05:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
years uh so I think that that was not uh
 
05:00:40.750 --> 05:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
specifically said because we don't have
 
05:00:43.590 --> 05:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
the questions yet yet thank you other
 
05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
 
05:00:45.040 --> 05:00:48.070 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
representative

05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:52.030 --> 05:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
pno in this modern day and age where we
 
05:00:54.110 --> 05:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
have all of our data on electronic
 
05:00:57.548 --> 05:00:57.558 align:start position:0%
devices why are these all only on paper
 
05:01:01.350 --> 05:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's a great question um not so long ago
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
almost all case types were uh paper case
 
05:01:06.110 --> 05:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
types and it it is a cost of over
 
05:01:09.070 --> 05:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to transition a case type so we
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
have been slowly over time transitioning
 
05:01:14.670 --> 05:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
case types from paper to electronic over
 
05:01:16.750 --> 05:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
over a decade and many of them are now
 
05:01:18.670 --> 05:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
electronic uh but there are a few that
 
05:01:20.548 --> 05:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
are not the reason that this one hangs
 
05:01:23.470 --> 05:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
around on the list is is a few fold one
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
if we did make it uh digital it would
 
05:01:27.390 --> 05:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
probably need to be handled a little bit
 
05:01:28.510 --> 05:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
different so it would need to have
 
05:01:29.948 --> 05:01:29.958 align:start position:0%
certain features that you would expect
 
05:01:32.070 --> 05:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
to see for DV cases like an escape
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
button the person can press which will
 
05:01:34.948 --> 05:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
normalize their screen so that if their
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
users right behind them they they don't
 
05:01:38.548 --> 05:01:38.558 align:start position:0%
see that they were working on a petition
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so the bidding is a little bit higher
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
for that so and we just haven't had the
 
05:01:44.670 --> 05:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
extra funds to transition this case type
 
05:01:46.750 --> 05:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
it is something that will happen
 
05:01:50.590 --> 05:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
eventually other questions so Mr I guess
 
05:01:52.948 --> 05:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
I just have one question I the only
 
05:01:56.350 --> 05:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
thing that concerns me is it the bill
 
05:01:56.360 --> 05:01:57.430 align:start position:0%
thing that concerns me is it the bill
doesn't

05:01:57.430 --> 05:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
05:02:01.030 --> 05:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
say um it says uh the independent
 
05:02:02.750 --> 05:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
contract should conduct manual review of
 
05:02:04.750 --> 05:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and stalking cases and
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
related criminal cases in order to
 
05:02:09.310 --> 05:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
compile and collate data for statistical
 
05:02:09.320 --> 05:02:10.590 align:start position:0%
compile and collate data for statistical
analysis

05:02:10.590 --> 05:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
05:02:13.390 --> 05:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
I guess my only question is this doesn't
 
05:02:16.750 --> 05:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
say what will be you know what data will
 
05:02:18.670 --> 05:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
be captured or what
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
so I mean if we if we pass this bill and
 
05:02:26.150 --> 05:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
the and you know it's and the $30,000 is
 
05:02:28.030 --> 05:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated do we have to worry that
 
05:02:30.030 --> 05:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a fight
 
05:02:32.470 --> 05:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
among you know some interest groups
 
05:02:34.430 --> 05:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
about like well capture this data but
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
not this data or capture you know this
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
much but not so I'm wondering if if if
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
you see that as an issue that we ought
 
05:02:44.788 --> 05:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
to address perhaps by an amendment or
 
05:02:46.948 --> 05:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
whatever I I would not want to speak for
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor but it it is my
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that she was going to
 
05:02:51.430 --> 05:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment once those questions
 
05:02:52.910 --> 05:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
were set she had a deadline that she had
 
05:02:55.270 --> 05:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
to hit with submitting the original Bill
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
and was working on those questions I I I
 
05:02:58.990 --> 05:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
would hate to be incorrect in that but I
 
05:03:00.628 --> 05:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
believe she did want to set those
 
05:03:02.590 --> 05:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
questions with the universe of people
 
05:03:05.110 --> 05:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
who have um been seeking data of one
 
05:03:06.990 --> 05:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
kind of another and then seek it by an
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
amendment I think there also may be an
 
05:03:11.030 --> 05:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
amendment on the funds appropriation
 
05:03:12.990 --> 05:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
because um those that deal with federal
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
funds know that they typically have
 
05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
supplantation limitations which is you
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
can't supplant State spending so there
 
05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
is a just a little tweak that needs to
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
be done to one line here so that we
 
05:03:23.310 --> 05:03:23.320 align:start position:0%
don't accidentally get in a situation
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
where we can't get federal funds or
 
05:03:27.590 --> 05:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
state funds because of how it's phrased
 
05:03:30.030 --> 05:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
um there there are some things coming up
 
05:03:31.830 --> 05:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
in September that we could apply for but
 
05:03:33.470 --> 05:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
it it just has to be phrased in such a
 
05:03:36.510 --> 05:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
way that it's not supplanting okay so I
 
05:03:37.788 --> 05:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
do believe there is an amendment coming
 
05:03:39.430 --> 05:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
forward that would make that correction
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
and probably add the list of questions
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
for your
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:52.708 --> 05:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
um just making some notes here so before
 
05:03:52.718 --> 05:04:00.230 align:start position:0%
um just making some notes here so before
I

05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:03.948 --> 05:04:03.958 align:start position:0%
forget right uh questions for this
 
05:04:07.230 --> 05:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:04:10.788 --> 05:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you all right um
 
05:04:14.150 --> 05:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to uh
 
05:04:17.830 --> 05:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
speak on HP 762 FN Mr albre you have
 
05:04:20.030 --> 05:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
something else you want to
 
05:04:20.040 --> 05:04:24.868 align:start position:0%
something else you want to
say

05:04:24.868 --> 05:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
sure just one followup I heard these
 
05:04:29.430 --> 05:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
aren't in electronic form yet they're
 
05:04:31.628 --> 05:04:31.638 align:start position:0%
regularly faxed to and from the judicial
 
05:04:36.990 --> 05:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
branch so I'm curious why facts is don't
 
05:04:39.990 --> 05:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
count as electronic storage and whether
 
05:04:41.628 --> 05:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
any of those faxes are retained
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
electronically and I think that should
 
05:04:45.070 --> 05:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
be addressed thank you all right thank
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
you very much any questions from stert
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you is there anyone
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
else who wishes to testify on uh HB 762
 
05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
FNA seeing none I'm going to call I'm
 
05:05:01.470 --> 05:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
going to close the hearing on uh HB 762
 
05:05:38.590 --> 05:05:38.600 align:start position:0%
