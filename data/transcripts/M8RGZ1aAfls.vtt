everyone to understand that this
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
committee is about finding facts on the
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
covid response through scientific uh
 
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 align:start position:0%
data so
 
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.390 align:start position:0%
data so

timeline with us um and explain to us
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
how things rolled out uh for the State
 
00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
of New
 
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I truly appreciate her

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
good morning um for the record again my
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
name is Patricia Tilly I am an associate
 
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the Department of Health
 
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
and Human Services thank you so much for
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
inviting me to be here today to go
 
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
through the timeline of events uh for
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic my review today
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
will simply be uh based in facts and
 
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
dates and events much like your mission
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a full after Action Report with
 
00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations we're just going to go
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
through the wayb back machine and go
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
through time um we're going to set the
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
stage for what happened when in front of
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
you as I said is a draft document it
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
looks a little bit like the children's
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
game shoots in ladders you're going to
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
have to follow along as we go forward it
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
takes you on a three-year Journey from
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
January 2020 to the end of the federal
 
00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency in May
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
2023 again importantly this is a draft
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
document all of us lived those years
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
together it impacted every part of our
 
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:41.959 align:start position:0%
Lives um and later this morning or on
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
further reflection I would I need from
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
you if possible um feedback as to
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
whether there are important moments you
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
feel are missing or that should also be
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
captured in such a document this was an
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for my staff and I to go
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
back through some documents and sort of
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
just lay out you know what happened when
 
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
it is additive to the after action
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
report that I talked about last time we
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
gathered that Homeland Security is
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
developing that is a much more
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
comprehensive document this simply is
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
just sort of the timeline of things
 
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.200 align:start position:0%
today so uh while I'm not prepared today
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
to do that full reflection or after
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
action review I do have some thoughts to
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
frame this journey that we're about to
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
take together number one communication
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
is the response we all felt um at times
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
with the changing evolving and confusing
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
messages we felt unmowed at times we
 
00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
overused the word unprecedented because
 
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
this crisis was exactly that but
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
transparency is key and part of that
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
transparency is communicating when
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
things change and we there are many
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
lessons to be learned about the way
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
things were communicated to the public
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
about the ways in which Comm State agen
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
genes communicated with each other the
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
way the federal government communicated
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
with the state department tons of
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
lessons to learn that all can be
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
unpacked at another time but I truly
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
believe fundamentally communication is
 
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
the response and when we get that right
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
everything else Falls in place data is a
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
key component of transparency and the
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
expectations for
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
immediate um data overwhelmed our old
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
Legacy state agency data system
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
and while doctors and nurses were busy
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
treating individuals other heroic folks
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
were in the background they were
 
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
building brand new Data Systems to
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
transmit and visualize data in ways and
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
at rates at which we had never done
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
before so that's just sort of context
 
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
for where we were three Co taught us
 
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
again and again um and probably still
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
teaches us to pay attention to the kids
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
pay attention to our loved ones in Long
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
term care facilities those that needed
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
to work on the front lines of our
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
hospitals our schools and other
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
essential Services covid was a
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
collective trauma and the impacts were
 
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
uneven among different groups of people
 
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
four the Swiss cheese approach to
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
protection is the way to go it's one of
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
my favorite analogies that came out of
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
um the pandemic and that simply was to
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
refresh your mind maybe you remember Dr
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
Ben Chan talking about the Swiss cheese
 
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
apprach when he was on WMUR um each
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
layer of protection from mask to air
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
filtration to social distancing to
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines is imperfect on its own there
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
are essentially small holes in each of
 
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
those strategies you can find a hole in
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
just about everything but if you layer
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
those pieces of Swiss cheese together
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully where the holes don't align
 
00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:56.839 align:start position:0%
you can develop a stronger protection
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
system the best thing about the s twis
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
cheese approach is that it can change
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
over time layering um more or fewer
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
approaches as needed either by a
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
community or by a person with their own
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
individual risks so again we have its
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
additive there are many layers of
 
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
protection none of them are perfect on
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
their own when you combine them together
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
you generally get greater
 
00:12:23.949 --> 00:12:23.959 align:start position:0%
protection and then
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
finally there are many potential
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
Solutions all with strengths and
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
challenges on almost every measure New
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fared better than other
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
states while we have lost about 3,300
 
00:12:44.189 --> 00:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters to co we had the second
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
lowest death rate in the country second
 
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
only to Hawaii that was able to close
 
00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:53.079 align:start position:0%
its borders and is an island so I don't
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
count them um they count but they don't
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
count um one St study noted that new
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's major advantage was that New
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's residents reported the
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
highest level of interpersonal trust
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
some of those folks have tied that to
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
our culture in form of government sort
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
of work that we're doing right here
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
today um some of it to our small town
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement our volunteerism in in
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
our communities our beautiful outdoor
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
environment which we talked a little bit
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
about last time in New Hampshire I put
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
this up to the fact that we work through
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
our differences and I think that that's
 
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839 align:start position:0%
what's really important as we think
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
about this whole C pandemic response
 
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
thousands of your neighbors and your
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
constituents stepped up into key
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
leadership positions and helped us get
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
through the pandemic they were National
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%

00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
relationships and Community is good for
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
your mental and physical health
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
resilience and I can't help but believe
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
that is what helped us weather those
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
three years so I will those are just my
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
opening comments and I will take you on
 
00:14:16.269 --> 00:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
this little journey now so again get
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
back in your way back machine um back in
 
00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.230 align:start position:0%
back in your way back machine um back in
January

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
2020 uh 2020 January 21st 2020 the
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Service
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
sent out its first notice to healthcare
 
00:14:30.749 --> 00:14:30.759 align:start position:0%
providers in something that's called a
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
Han a health alert Network it's a
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
message it used to go by fax machine way
 
00:14:38.749 --> 00:14:38.759 align:start position:0%
back in the day it is now emailed um and
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
it basically says to doctors nurses
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
healthc Care Systems there's something
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
out there we use it for all sorts of
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
things and back in the first Han that we
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
sent about covid-19 was on January 21st
 
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
2020 by January 31st there was a federal
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency declared as we
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
understood what was going on
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
internationally and as the West Coast
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
post started to deal with covid-19
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
Washington state was where the first
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
cases of covid-19 um landed by March 2nd
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire had its first covid-19
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
case um but also on March 2nd our New
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Health laboratory
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
started testing and had the capacity to
 
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
test for covid-19 I will remind you of
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
something that's probably lost on all of
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
us we all remember supply chain
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
shortages comically we remember no
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
toilet paper any we for any one of us
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that was truly
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for us right out of the gate
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
was the swab it takes to test for
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
covid-19 it's a fancy Q-tip and you may
 
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%
remember it from back then it sort of
 
00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
felt like it went up to your brain as it
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
tickled you everyone was searching for
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
swabs that was what took in those first
 
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
weeks of March we were desperate first
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
and it was the first inkling of the
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues that we would
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
experience through throughout much of
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
the early pandemic we put up 211 lots of
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
people had questions we created 211 to
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
to answer some of those we set up call
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
centers the National Guard was helpful
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
by March 23rd so you remember the first
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
case was March 2nd by the 23rd we had
 
00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
100 cases of covid in New Hampshire a
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
visual image I will give to you is
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
originally on our in the public health
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
um in a in a locked room there was a
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
place where we put the you know initials
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
and numbers of cases on a whiteboard and
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
they were written in very big letters
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
right away and then the words got
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
smaller those numbers and initials kept
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
getting smaller and smaller and then you
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
had to flip the Whiteboard and then
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
there was a second whiteboard and then
 
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
the whiteboards all went away I mean
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
that is to me one of the earliest
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
memories I have of the ways in which we
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
were not prepared for the speed at which
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
things were
 
00:16:57.389 --> 00:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
going um by the 16th Governor sonunu um
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
started issuing some restrictions um and
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
the uh 15th he he had um yes I'm
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
sorry I skipped over so the declare
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
you're right my shoots and letters I
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
look down to the wrong place so uh our
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
first state of emergency was March 13
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
that is um again after the federal
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
public em Health Emergency declared in
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
January New Hampshire declared its 1 in
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
March 13th we o we the governor created
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
the state um emergency Operation Center
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
for covid that was managed by Homeland
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
Security and then we started seeing
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
those um other issues those other
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
emergency declarations by March 23rd we
 
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
had the first death in the state um we
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
then started seeing some temporary
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions on Gatherings and our
 
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home orders started by March
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
26th by March 30th the National Guard
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
was activated to assist with the
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
response and by April 3rd we had 500
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
cases of covid-19 go to the next page
 
00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
here um by April those numbers are
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
exponential as I said you know this is
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
no longer on a whiteboard we had to
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
develop very robust Data Systems to
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
manage um by April the governor uh de
 
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
created two things that were very
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
important to this response one the
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
governor's office for emergency relief
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
and Recovery gopher as it's known to all
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
of us handled much of the federal money
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
that was coming in for Relief then
 
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
similarly at the same about the same
 
00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
time Governor established the governor's
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
reopening task force the economic
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
reopening task force understanding that
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
our our society our businesses they
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
could not stay closed forever and so
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
very quickly the governor did something
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
that was quite radical in comparison to
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
other states which was to put
 
00:18:54.549 --> 00:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
legislators like yourselves paired with
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
Community experts industry experts on a
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
panel to say how do we get back open and
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
did that in a transparent way um did
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
phone calls back we wasn't even on teams
 
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
or zooms but did phone calls at some
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
point every day sometimes a couple times
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
a week back down to once a week um where
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
deliberations um you uh there are some
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
other pieces so by May you'll see that
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
the first antiviral treatments start
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
arriving in in the department and in New
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire We Begin testing more than
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
1,500 people a day for
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and by June 15th the
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home order
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
expired we began to open up by June 2020
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
hotels lodging campgrounds began to open
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
up in limited ways with the guidance of
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
that reopening task force and meanwhile
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
sort of while other things were
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
happening this was where we were working
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
with the supply chain around things like
 
00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:58.950 align:start position:0%
with the supply chain around things like
gloves

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
gloves
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
masks and personal protective equipment
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
we all learned the letters PPE and New
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire organized the largest cargo
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
flight in in the Manchester Airport um
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
history Landing with PPE for New
 
00:20:16.909 --> 00:20:16.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we developed warehousing to be
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
able to distribute and make sure to
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
house it to store it and distribute it
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
so we could get that out on the ground
 
00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
where it
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
belongs um we now by August have some
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
early rapid antigen tests those first
 
00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559 align:start position:0%
rapid tests that we all now have sitting
 
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
in our closets at home but that they did
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
not come out until August of
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
2020 um by September when I spoke about
 
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
data we launched um a covid-19 dashboard
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
that was updated daily if you can recall
 
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
back in the early days even you know
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
before September there were daily press
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
conferences and daily briefings by
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
September we had all that information
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
available to anyone with a couple of
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
clicks of your fingers by November 18th
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
500 people have died and by November
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
20th um the governor suoo issued a mass
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
mandate for residents over five years
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
old by December
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
2020 is when we had our first vaccine
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
available and administered in New
 
00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm going to remind myself
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
here I'm going to pull up um the uh
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh the distribution plan maybe I won't
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
do that off my my phone maybe I'll do it
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
from memory here um we had if you'll
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
recall it vaccines were in very short
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
supply when they first came out and so
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
every state had a rollout plan for
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
vaccinations New Hampshire did this
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
differently and so this is an example
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire did things a little
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
bit different than the rest of the
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
country we looked at our own data and we
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
said what's right for New Hampshire CDC
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
was recommending in those first early um
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
rollouts to focus on just essential
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
workers the definitions of a central
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
worker was pretty Loosey Goosey um and
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
instead we took a hard look at the data
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
and the way in which we rolled out these
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
limited supplies early on was within our
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
phase one it was for high-risk health
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
care workers and First Responders
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
because those were the folks on the
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
ground also included in that we knew
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
that the people who were dying at this
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
time were 85 and older and in long-term
 
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
care and so that's where we put the
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines is was among the people who
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
were dying again vaccine the state of
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire did not require
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines um at the time Health Care
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
Facilities may have required them in
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
their facility but there was no State
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
order requiring a vaccine by quickly um
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
soon after we rolled out a vaccine for
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
anyone over the age of 75 and uh and
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
folks that were medically vulnerable
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
with two or more conditions by phase 2A
 
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
we continued to open up the door as more
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines came in we opened it up to
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
individuals 65 or 65 to age 74 school
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
and um Child Care staff those were the
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
folks in that phase 2A phase 2B was age
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
50 to 60 before again taking an
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
age-based approach because that's where
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
the risk was and then um after that
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
medically VA young medically vulnerable
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
folks under the age of 50 and then
 
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
finally everyone else so that was the
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
staging at which we um expanded yes and
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
just that do you have uh dates for like
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
when each of those you know what I can
 
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
get those to you because we um what I
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
was able to find right now was sort of
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
our original plan and we were actually
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
able to speed that up so I can get that
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
back to you but I don't have it right
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
now you're very welcome so that was the
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine roll out so meanwhile back in
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
December we were doing those rollouts we
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
started again with healthc care
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
providers you know Christmas day 20120
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
um is the is the time we saw deaths Peak
 
00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire pandemic at an
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
average over 12 deaths per week so
 
00:24:24.029 --> 00:24:24.039 align:start position:0%
vaccine was rolling out while we were
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
seeing these I'm going to use the word
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
again unprecedented numbers of deaths so
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
folks that had not had any opportunity
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
to be vaccine vaccinated as we did the
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
rollout you may all remember we created
 
00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
13 State managed covid-19 vaccine sites
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
and those were uh resourced by the
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
National Guard and other um Partners
 
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
along the way many of us remember
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
driving up to them or standing in line I
 
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
got my first vaccine and what used to be
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
the Sears in the Steeplegate Mall the
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know the place where you used to get
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
your oil changed that's where folks
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
started getting their vaccine by January
 
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
25th nearly 200,000 people signed up for
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
a vaccination again I will just note uh
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
prior to this we had no way to register
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
200,000 people for anything and so that
 
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
was part of the data systems that needed
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
to be created and quite frankly
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
resourced to be able to handle that
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
level of Interest February 11th we're up
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
to a thousand deaths reported
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
um we uh but by February 19th Again by
 
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
2021 um it's important to not the
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
governor we have vaccines available and
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
so the governor orders um that at least
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
that schools have at least two days of
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
in-person instruction for public schools
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
K to 12 so again the order of this is
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
important we have vaccines it's time to
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
get kids back in school um we March we
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
had our first vaccination events at the
 
00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Speedway maybe some of you
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
participated in that as well those were
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
phenomenal Affairs and a Real Testament
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
to the Partnerships in New Hampshire
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
that allowed us to use resources of how
 
00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
do you get as those vaccination dates
 
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
were opening to your to your point
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
earlier um as more and more how do you
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
actually do that in a way and so the
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
speedway was extraordinarily um uh uh
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
collaborative with us in working with
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security to organize that those
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
events right there by the time we have
 
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine we hear the CDC say fully vaccin
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
they start giving guidance about how
 
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
fully vaccinated people can safely
 
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
interact with each other by March 22nd
 
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
everything is available to everyone 16
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
and over um along the way uh the mask
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
mandate it gets lifted soon after those
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines are available to
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
everyone um and then um by May 3rd over
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
half of the new New Hampshire residents
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
over 16 have received their first
 
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
vaccine the um by the 21st the state op
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
Emergency Operations Center and the
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
joint information center close a
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
tremendous moment just in terms of uh
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
Pro the work that it takes among state
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
agencies that seoc as we call it the
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
state emergency operation oper Center
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
had been opened for over a year 7 days a
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
week with folks on call 24 hours a day
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
and so it was able to be closed June
 
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.230 align:start position:0%
and so it was able to be closed June
30th

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
30th
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
2021 right in July we started knowing
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
that there were individuals who were
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
unable to access vaccines in places like
 
00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:38.919 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Speedway or at our
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
vaccine sites we launched our vaccine
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
van and that was able to provide
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines in communities um and among um
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
folks that were homebound which was
 
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.870 align:start position:0%
folks that were homebound which was
really

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
important um again July 23rd 2021
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed I'm sure
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
many of you were involved with um that
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
prohibited state and local government
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
agencies from requiring proof of
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
vaccination to access facilities or
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
Services vaccine has been
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh 20 uh October 29th FDA
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
authorizes vaccine for ages 5 to 11 so
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
kiddos can start now having the
 
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity if that's what their
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
families want by November 23rd 2021
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
Governor um cunu um issues an order to
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
address hospit capacity maybe you all
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
can remember this this was a very
 
00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
critical moment in November December of
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
um in January uh between 2021 late 2021
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
and early 2022 our hospitals were um
 
00:28:46.509 --> 00:28:46.519 align:start position:0%
teaming at that point the at the highest
 
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
level we had almost 600 people
 
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
hospitalized for covid-19 in our
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh and our hospitals were at
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
the breaking point and so the governor
 
00:28:59.549 --> 00:28:59.559 align:start position:0%
issued orders we created flexibilities
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
for those hospitals so in order to care
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
for them the National Guard came in and
 
00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
participated and tried to relieve our
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals and our doctors and nurses
 
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
from some of the administrative
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
functions or sort of the environmental
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
functions we had uh National Guard
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
members delivering meals within those
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals this was for our Health Care
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
Systems this was probably one of the
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
scariest moments when those numbers
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
started to really um get
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
high again our deaths peaked at about 12
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
deaths per week in December there's um
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
not a lot of um coincidence around that
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
our respiratory rates I've gone back and
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
looked at the data over time the weeks
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
between Christmas and New Year are Bad
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
News Bears that is bad for everybody
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
it's bad for respiratory disease we're
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
together we're sick we're all you know
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
we're with our family with our friends
 
00:29:53.509 --> 00:29:53.519 align:start position:0%
and that is always whether it's flu RSV
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
covid those weeks between Christmas and
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
New Year's are always bad and we saw
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
that once again play out with covid we
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
saw it years later um the next year in
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
2022 with children with RSV if you may
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
remember that once kids were back so
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
this is a normal pattern but certainly
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
scary by June um again we have vaccines
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
for the youngest children age six months
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
to five years um by August CDC is no
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
longer recommending quarantine for those
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
exposed to covid-19 you remember we used
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
to have quarantine if you knew somebody
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
you'd also have to quarantine they were
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
still recommending isolation if you were
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
sick but no longer if your close contact
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
were sick did you have to quarantine as
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
well by March 23rd we have the
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
publication of that report that I was
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
talking about where New Hampshire had
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
had the second lowest death rate and
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
they really investigated some of those
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
societal factors that led to that that
 
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
could have perhaps contributed in this
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
idea that New Hampshire is a truly
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
unique and special place in the sense
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
that we work together that we have trust
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
in our interpersonal relationships and
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
within our communities by May 6 we have
 
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919 align:start position:0%
3,000 deaths in New Hampshire and by May
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
11th 2023 the federal Public Health
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
Emergency ended so again there were many
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
other pieces that I think all of us
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
might remember from there um but I hope
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
that that was a good overview for you of
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
just sort of the Shoots and Ladders
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
where we were thank
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
you does anyone have any questions or
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
comments thatly to make representative
 
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.789 align:start position:0%
comments thatly to make representative
Weber

00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
please thank you so much Madam chair and
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for just taking my comment
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
which is that uh you did some discussion
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
of when vaccines were rolled out for the
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
various age ranges and like your
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
whiteboards that got more and more dense
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not sure integrating it into
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
this graphic is what is needed but
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
having that timeline as well yes would
 
00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
be really helpful my own memory is that
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
I wrote a I wrote a summary for our Our
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
Town web page every week based on that
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
data that you had on the dashboard and
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
also giving people information about all
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
the stuff that nobody had ever thought
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
about before I mean how to apply for
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation for people
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
who'd never ever had to do so before in
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
their lives and who could apply on all
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
of that stuff and and uh people got to
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
the point of relying on that to the
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
point where when there wasn't any news
 
00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
one week and I didn't write it I got
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
email saying are you sick you know what
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
can we do but I think that kind of
 
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
timeline is is also helpful and I um I
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
probably the response in terms of things
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
like unemployment compensation and all
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
of that is probably outside of what this
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
committee does but um having the
 
00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
response in terms of um when when things
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
were available I think would be helpful
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you and thank you for this
 
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
which is wonderful oh thank you and
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that comment to
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
your point we had a graphic that I
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
almost shared with you but it w the
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
original graphic around the roll out we
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
were able to roll out sooner than the
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
graphic even originally said because we
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
were we were rolling out vaccines as we
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
had them available from the federal
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
government I you know I think it's
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
important to note um the the federal
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
government controlled the vaccine Supply
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
um and they sent it to States we did not
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
in the during the state of emergency um
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
they were free to the the vaccine itself
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
was free the state didn't pay for
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines individuals didn't pay for
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines um and then by the time the
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
emergency the state of emergency was
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
over those vaccines have been
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
commercialized and now there's a cost
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
Associated to them and now the state has
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
nothing to do um with that distribution
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
so but I will um go back and we'll see
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
if we can get the exact dates when each
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
of those opened we've got to dig a
 
00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.789 align:start position:0%
of those opened we've got to dig a
little

00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
more uh
 
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
ran thank you chair thanks for taking my
 
00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
question again um can you remind me how
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
covid deaths were defined like in terms
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
and has that changed over time I sure
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
vaguely remember that so thank thanks
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
for that question because I know it's a
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of uh there's been a lot
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
of consternation about that over time
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
sort of nationally and even here in New
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire always took a
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
very conservative approach to um covid
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
deaths one of the good things about New
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is we're small um our state
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
epidemi ologist reviewed every single
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
death record and there needed to be
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
covid on the death record for it to be
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
classified as a covid death so again
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
your providers are the ones who
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
determine whether a death is co or not
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
the state department uh of Health then
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
confirmed every single one of those
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
deaths it takes a little while to do
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
that for a couple of reasons one just to
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
gather that information death data is
 
00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
always lags a little bit um and we were
 
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
also collecting information from other
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
states so if was a New Hampshire
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
resident that died in Boston it takes a
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
little bit longer so that's a little bit
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
of a lagging indicator it's one of the
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
reasons why for us hospitalization still
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
is and was the sort of indicator that
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
was like what we were really paying
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
attention quite frankly more than cases
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
after early on because hospitalization
 
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
was really severity of of disease um we
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
can come back another time and I can
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
give deeper um explanation of that
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
epidemiological process of going through
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
and confirming each case count at the
 
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.870 align:start position:0%
and confirming each case count at the
chair's

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
chair's
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
discretion absolutely quickly um so how
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
does that compare to how other states
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
were doing it just thinking if we're
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
ranking ourselves very highly other
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
states um use respiratory illness
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes as well as covid and um so I
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to bring my my epies back
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
and really walking through
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
Penza so I'd like to understand um in
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
regards with testing and I think it's uh
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
I think you mentioned in it was probably
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
at some point in March when you had a
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
when you had a um like a preliminary
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
testing that was going on so I'd like to
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
understand when the PCR tests were come
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
in and I want to I want to understand
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
the Cycles I want to know those cycle
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
numbers so from the time that testing
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
started and where cycle numbers changed
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
I I'm sure I understand about the cycle
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
number if you could explain that to me
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
okay so um PCR test as you know um so
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
PCR test as you know if you um it'll
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
test positive for anything um for covid
 
00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
um if you cycle it up high enough you
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
can keep spinning it for that so it can
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
also test for someone that had been
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
recovered from covid Corona viruses are
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
in everything it can have someone that
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
just has the common cold flu can test
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
positive for it and all of that
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
especially early on testing has gone has
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
has come a long way from in the
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
beginning and I'd like to know what
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
those cycle numbers were sure I can't
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
provide that for you today I will need
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
to bring in my testing experts because I
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to give you misinformation in
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
that space But that again for the um
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
committee that seems like something that
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
would be a great time to spend a little
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
time on on how on the evolution of
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
testing thank
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and I'm
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
not sure how exactly we should go about
 
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
this um I have I have a few different
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions they should be short I guess
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
I'll just ask for follow-ups between
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
just keep right sounds good um so I'd
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
like to get a little bit into some of
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
the sort of specifics as it comes some
 
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
of the data and if you if you don't have
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
it at the moment that's fine we can
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
either get it provided or we can have
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
some later testimony on it and that
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
would be fine so just let me know but
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
you uh testified to the Swiss cheese
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
approach which makes some degree of
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
sense and I think just to highlight what
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is the idea is you
 
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
throw everything at it and collectively
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
everything will bring down the the uh
 
00:37:59.309 --> 00:37:59.319 align:start position:0%
the the ability of the virus to spread
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
um so since we are a science-based
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee can you tell me um what the
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
estimated R not of the virus was at the
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
time of adoption of the Swiss cheese
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
approach the what the estimated or not
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
would have been or what the what the
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
target was with that approach and what
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
data there is that demonstrates the r
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
not was reduced by that approach sure so
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
um R not is uh an epidemiological
 
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
function um I can't give you those
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
numbers off the top my I've got a lot of
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
numbers in my head I don't have those
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
numbers on the top of my head today so
 
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
we can come back and talk about that at
 
00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
another time again I was simply prepared
 
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:41.079 align:start position:0%
and asked to talk about a timeline today
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that we were looking
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
at those numbers and really it's about
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
the r is the rate of spread and is it
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
exponential is it not exponential and so
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
um you know some of the ways the um ways
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
we talked about it was flattening the
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
curve that was the other language that
 
00:38:59.790 --> 00:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
we used of we expected it to go up and
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
we actually saw that slope for the
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
mathematic you know mathematicians in
 
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
the room that slope get a little bit
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
shorter and so what we certainly saw
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
early you know when you had a ton of
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
those slices of of Swiss cheese and we
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
had to do physical protections things
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
like the stay-at-home order masking um
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
we saw some of those number we could
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
slow some of those numbers down um as
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines were available and individuals
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to not have those restrictive
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
policies especially for economic reasons
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
and all sorts of reasons kids needed to
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
be in school we then loosened up some of
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
those stay-at-home policies they those
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
went away people interacted more the VAC
 
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
you know the spread went up but we had
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
another piece of protection which was
 
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
vaccin so the those were the complicated
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
decisions you know policy decisions that
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
were made we can talk we can show you
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of um uh places
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
like John's Hopkins that tracks for each
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
state that are um not number and those
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
were used as part of the dis the
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
discovery and policymaking at the time
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's what I can tell
 
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
you and if I may um do a slightly
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
different uh topic you I believe you
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
said we have approximately and very
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
tragically lost about 3,500 New
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents 3300 3300 thank you
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire residents from Co I
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask because there has been so
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
much and I and I understand the
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
difficulty with Discerning exactly this
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
number um I wanted to ask are these can
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
we can we confirm with a high degree of
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
certainty that these are all deaths from
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
covid as opposed to Deaths with
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
covid I believe that our data is that uh
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
suggests that covid was the leading
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
contributor to those deaths thank you
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
and if I may on that on that same topic
 
00:40:56.119 --> 00:40:57.470 align:start position:0%
and if I may on that on that same topic
um

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
there were I I've seen reports and I
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
don't know whether this is totally
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
accurate or not um is it true that there
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
were um perhaps Medicare or Medicaid or
 
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
something of that sort paying out at a
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
higher rate if the death was labeled as
 
00:41:17.069 --> 00:41:17.079 align:start position:0%
covid versus something else I am not
 
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
aware of that I am also not a Medicaid
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
expert but I am not aware that that
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
happened that certainly wasn't part of
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
our policy um decision-making algorithm
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I
 
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.750 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I
may

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh regarding the uh stay-at-home
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
order uh you testified I believe at the
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
last hearing that from very early on in
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
the summer of 2020 New Hampshire
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
residents were urged to go Outdoors
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
because it was thought that outdoor
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
transmission would be negligible so I'm
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
asking can you speak to what what seems
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit of a contradiction
 
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
between that and the the stay-at-home
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
order which involved also everything
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
from beaches were closed to the closure
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
of trails in the White Mountains and uh
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
protesters gathering in front of this
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
state house who were threatened with
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
arrest for Gathering can you can you
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
speak to that discrep sure I you know
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
while I and I don't know that I use the
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
word negligible but it certainly was um
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know Outdoors is better than inside
 
00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
is what I would say Outdoors is better
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
than inside uh whenever you gather
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
closely together however that adds risk
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
and so I think those were the issues in
 
00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
those weeks early on trying to manage
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
both of those needs both the needs for
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
people to have opportunities to go
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
outside and also not Gather in a way
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
that was clustered together so all of us
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
have been been to Hampton Beach perhaps
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
on a 85 degree day when it's sunny and
 
00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
you know you're blanket to blanket with
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
folks that is probably riskier than
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
pit so I also have several questions and
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
I start with first one but first of all
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for this timeline uh it's very
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
helpful uh and uh also thank you for
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
being ready uh to come again and
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
testifying about your process of
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
confirming each case because uh it I
 
00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:26.559 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful for us to
 
00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
understand how provider determined uh
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
covid death and how DHHS was going
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
through process of confirming it uh so
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
um uh I think it would be uh useful uh
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
to have similar timelines for different
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh strategies or different measures uh
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
and uh for example thank you for
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
including uh vaccine measure here and uh
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
um uh and for example different measure
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
would be mask so specifically timeline
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
for how masking recommendations were
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
evolving and um my my uh preference
 
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:15.160 align:start position:0%
would be if possible including some uh
 
00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.670 align:start position:0%
would be if possible including some uh
scientific

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
scientific
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
uh um scientific timeline uh because
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
some of those measures probably were
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
Guided by politics and uh and
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
administrative uh
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
suggestions uh for example in the
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
beginning people were told not to buy
 
00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:38.839 align:start position:0%
masks but it was more like political
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
decision to save masks for First
 
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
Responders um represent po um we're
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
going to do this on scientific data we
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to bring the politics into
 
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
this yeah yeah that's why I I thank you
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm asking to include like
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
like um if some of these uh decisions
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
were based on science if you could
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
include some
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
some that for for example uh when uh uh
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
Dr Benjamin Chan testified that uh new
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
dat data showed that there some a
 
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
increased risk for myocarditis for uh
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
young males and uh male kids so
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
something like that uh uh when when it
 
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.589 align:start position:0%
something like that uh uh when when it
was

00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
already published in scientific paper
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
reviewed and acknowledged uh by DHHS
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
that it need to affect policies for
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
example on vaccine recommendations for
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
kids so some scientific points would be
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
helpful for timeline from my
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
perspective uh representative Penza do
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone else on the committee
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair and also
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you M chy for bringing this
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
timeline it's very informative and very
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
helpful would you speak to one of the
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
things you talked about was the
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
challenge not just here in New Hampshire
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
but throughout the whole country the
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
supply chain disruptions and what that
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
meant to the state here I want to say
 
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
commend the state for bringing in such a
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
large flight into Manchester Airport not
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
sure how it landed how it got out but
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for doing it but talk about
 
00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
the challenges the state faced with
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
trying to get supplies that you needed
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
so desperately to try to solve and
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
tackle some of the problems um I think
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know had any of us been talking in
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know 20 uh 20120 or December in 2019
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that any of us would have
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
thought that the success of a pandemic
 
00:46:58.589 --> 00:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
would really rest so much on supply
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
chain and Logistics and that is the
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
place where we certainly had some
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
preparations but even at a federal level
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
there's a federal strategic National
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
supply of of supplies um that was
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
inadequate right away um and states in
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
some cases were really left to fend on
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
their own because there were limit the
 
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:19.720 align:start position:0%
feds also could not provide that in
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
provide that those sort of supplies and
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
when we talk about some of those
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
supplies we are talking about medical
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
grade Mass the n95 surgical masks
 
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
talking about gloves um those were
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
things that were just in short supply we
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
had Daily Calls where we talked about
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
the literal number of boxes that we had
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
available that day and where we could
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
send them um and so we learned a lot uh
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic for example
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
had a very small room that was our
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
warehouse of stuff um we now rent
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
something that looks a little bit more
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
like a small Costco where we can
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
organize distribute use data systems
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
actually have logistic Data Systems some
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
of the best hires we had were folks like
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
from Walmart who really helped us
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
Implement how do you manage all of this
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
all of this product coming and going um
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
so that was tremendously difficult as I
 
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned early on you know we could
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
test if we only had swabs and so that
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
made some of the decisions you know back
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
to your question around um earlier about
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
political decisions versus scientific
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
decisions I would say that those were
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
not necessarily that they were not
 
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily political decisions but just
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
simply logistical decisions where you
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
only have five of something and you have
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
to decide where they go um luckily New
 
00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire never had a ration care never
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
had to really do those things so we were
 
00:48:46.589 --> 00:48:46.599 align:start position:0%
fortunate in that way but it took a
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of effort and still
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
does to make sure that we've got
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
resources out into the community one of
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
the things I'm most proud of is that not
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
only did we prioritize and get equipment
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
to long-term care facilities where we
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
saw such incredible um Devastation from
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
covid from to our hospitals um but also
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
into our communities and again I think
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's where we did really well we
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
worked very hard that our municipalities
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
had access to things and we tried to be
 
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
as transparent as possible and as
 
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
collaborative as possible Homeland
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
Security did a great job of connecting
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
with the municipalities with um
 
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
different uh with schools um with even
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
summer camps we were one of the first
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
states to open up summer camps for kids
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
and the way we were able to do that was
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to make sure that those camps
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
had access to testing and to PPE and
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
guidance on how to keep Kids
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
Safe representative
 
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
Weber I had two other thoughts about
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
responses that I I don't know how you
 
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
deal with these scientifically but maybe
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
you can um and if there was any kind of
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of whether it helped or
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
not but I'm thinking of the individual
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
response and and as as several people
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
have alluded to uh New Hampshire is a
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
state where everybody wants to pitch in
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking of the people who seed
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of masks and it was sort of
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
surreal because here we were were using
 
00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:15.349 align:start position:0%
surreal because here we were were using
1918

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
1918
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
technology uh and nothing had changed
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
but people were sewing lots of masks and
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh for my nursing home making um turning
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
old G shirts
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
into um protective garments that could
 
00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.190 align:start position:0%
into um protective garments that could
be

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
rewashed and so I wonder if there's any
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
kind of evaluation out
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
there as to whether that actually helped
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
with infection and things or whether it
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
simply served to create both keep people
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
busy and create a sense of purpose and
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
unity which is not a bad thing but it
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
would be useful to know going forward
 
00:50:57.870 --> 00:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
what kind of things the civilian
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
population can do to help that are the
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
the most actually effective to deal with
 
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
the problem you're faced with and I'm
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
thinking about certain other things and
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
this may be more for the after Action
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
Report that's being prepared but there
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
were certain things that we did uh and
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking specifically of the setting
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
up of mobile hospitals everywhere which
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
hindsight being 2020 were not needed and
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
we're very grateful that they weren't
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
but I certainly don't think you could
 
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.190 align:start position:0%
but I certainly don't think you could
have

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
ignored looking at the numbers as we
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
were looking at them the possibility
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
that we might need them and we certainly
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
saw all the pictures from all the other
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
places where they certainly had no place
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
to put very sick people so I those kind
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
of evaluations I think if they are
 
00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
available anywhere would be helpful but
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
not sure that they are yeah I I'm not
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
sure they are right now I think our the
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
the larger after action report is going
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about um you know
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
our Playbook we've been preparing for a
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic forever um The Playbook was
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
essentially for an influenza and an
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
influenza event and you know based on
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
what we know about influenza and the you
 
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
know it's all modeling at that point but
 
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
it's preparedness work it's the way all
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
of us prepare for everything in our
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
homes we we don't always get it right
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
but you know you have some things
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
together and so you know the
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
preparedness Playbook suggested you're
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
going to need those mobile hospitals
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
luckily we did not need them that's
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
great but that's what we knew to do at
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
the time and it really helped us
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
mobilize get the right people together
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
to make some of those um decisions about
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
what was in fact the right the the
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
better approach for caring for
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
individuals with this particular virus
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
to your point around masks I'm not aware
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
I mean certainly I you know as a public
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
health professional I can tell you that
 
00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:56.799 align:start position:0%
the cloth masks are not as effective as
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
the surgical masks which are not as
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
effective as the n95s we knew that but
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
again you PL you mirrored that with the
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues where we knew we
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
needed to have those that PPE the most
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
effective PPE in our healthc care and
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
long-term care um centers because that's
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
where the people who with the most risk
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
were and so you know so again the Swiss
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
cheese there's uh there's some
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
protection wearing that cloth mask I I
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
just threw ACH away in my home I was
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
doing a little cleaning it feels good to
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
throw them away I'm sure everyone else
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
has done the same thing um you know
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
they're not as effective and I think we
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
knew that or that was not unknown to us
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
at the time but when you have a limited
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
supply of something you do what you need
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
to do to until we get that bigger supply
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
and then we evolve was the hardest thing
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
about this pandemic is that things were
 
00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:51.270 align:start position:0%
about this pandemic is that things were
always

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
changing repr
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
leus we heard after the vir vaccines
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
came out we were getting
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
numbers at least
 
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
weekly about um infections infection
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
rate and how much was vaccinated people
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
and how much was unvaccinated
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
people and I'm wondering how were you
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
collecting that data and um how accurate
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
was that data sure so um soon uh
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
especially as the um the rapid tests
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
came out um collecting data on cases was
 
00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
difficult you know we knew that because
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
as soon as you could take a test at home
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
that test was not reported to anywhere
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
the way it works if a hospital or health
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
care provider um provided a covid-19
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
test at the time no longer is the case
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
but at the time that information went
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
directly to the Department of Health uh
 
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
because it was part of this uh emergency
 
00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
so we knew that there was always a
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
little bit of information that we did
 
00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
not know um and often we use data from
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
um the studies that created the vaccines
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
to understand the effectiveness of the
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines that's some of it but we knew
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
early on that as time went on that that
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
information would be less um accurate
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
over time and so we stopped collecting
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
it because it simply was less accurate
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't make decisions based on
 
00:55:24.359 --> 00:55:29.069 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't make decisions based on
it

00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
so if you knew it was less accurate and
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
you stopped collecting it what were you
 
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
basing the reports that we saw so when
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
during those reports we had the data
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
because data was most most people were
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
getting their tests by a medical
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
provider as that as that shift happened
 
00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
which is is when we shifted back to a
 
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
different we shifted to a different
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
strategy does that make sense yes thank
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
you yeah r p it uh thank you Madame
 
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking another
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
question uh uh it was very uh uplifting
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
to hear that New Hampshire had second
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
lowest uh uh death rate after Hawaii but
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
also you mentioned uh incredible
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
Devastation and long-term care
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
facilities so uh is it true that New
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire overall fed good but there
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
were some um pockets uh uh such as uh uh
 
00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
LTC facilities when where New Hampshire
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
probably was not as good compared to
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
other state I don't know that I have the
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
comparison of our long-term care
 
00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
facilities to other states we have you
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
know again folks were uh some of the
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
national folks that were looking at data
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
are surprised because New Hampshire of
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
course is so much older than other
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
states they assumed New Hampshire were
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
to have higher rates of of death and we
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
didn't um but but you know we managed
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
our long-term care facilities to the
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
best degree that we can and by we I mean
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
the long-term care facilities themselves
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
as well as with the the support from the
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
state um one death is too many and death
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
among the long-term care facilities are
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
all each of those are tragic so I I
 
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
while I am proud of comparatively how
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
we've done I don't want any
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding one death is too
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
many represent
 
00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
Merchant Madam chair unfortunately have
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
to go to another committee meeting um in
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
regards to the next scheduled meeting is
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
it still going to be March 8th in the
 
00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
morning uh so there's been really quick
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
um not sure would afternoon work for you
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
I believe uh representative not not on
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
the eth unfortun I have another conflict
 
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
on the eth of another committee so I
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
will send out an email to the entire
 
00:57:46.789 --> 00:57:46.799 align:start position:0%
committee to see who can be here in the
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
morning and who cannot what what works
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
best for and will go with the majority
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and thank you for leading
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
the leading the charge as the chair and
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
also miss Tilly thank you for your time
 
00:57:59.789 --> 00:57:59.799 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much representative
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
represent Penza
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
please so I remembered my question from
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
before I'd like to go back
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
to um and I I'm not sure you know was
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know a collaboration of course
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
between uh the governor's office and and
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
Dr Shan and DHHS um why weren't there
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
public pivots when we knew things were
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
like asymptomatic spread you know I know
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
that there's some other Representatives
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
here that have asked about um you know
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
outdoors and beaches and all that kind
 
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
of stuff we knew very early on that that
 
00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
was not true um that was pushed a lot so
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
where why wasn't there public um why
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't there why wasn't there a a public
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
why did those those things keep being
 
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
said kind of beaten to a dead horse um
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
about um asymptomatic spread when we
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
knew that early on I'm not sure I'm
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
fully understanding your question right
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
you asking about that um why did we say
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
there was asymptomatic spread and are
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
you contending there was not
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic spread is that
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
understanding I just want to understand
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
your question so early on in there was
 
00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
tons of talk with social distancing and
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
all of these things that have now been
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
completely um like in a sense disproven
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
that those weren't helpful um so I'm I'm
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
asking and we knew that early on that
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
asymptomatic spread was not valid so why
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't there a pivot at that point I'm
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
not sure that asymptom asymptomatic
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
spread is not valid I think we have
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
cases where there was asymptomatic
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
spread so I just want to start there you
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
know we know that it is more likely you
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
are more likely to get covid-19 with
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
someone who has heavy viral shedding
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
who's coughing at you know and sort of
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
spreading disease I I agree with you on
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
that that is you're more likely but I I
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
would not suggest that there is no um
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
chance of asymptomatic spread especially
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
early in the pandemic when we had very
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
little immune system towards um covid-19
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
so um you know I I can go back and have
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
additional conversations I don't know
 
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:11.720 align:start position:0%
again I was prepared to talk about
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
timeline today I'm not fully prepared to
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
get into the scientific pieces of that
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
um but I do want to say that there
 
01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:21.880 align:start position:0%
certainly have been cases observed cases
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
where it appears that there was a
 
01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.150 align:start position:0%
where it appears that there was a
symptomatic

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for being here I
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
really like the timeline thank you um
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
but I do find
 
01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
um think um I have a couple of questions
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
um of the 3300 deaths do you have a
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
breakdown of Ages like age groups I
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
think that would be
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
beneficial um and of those deaths do we
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
know if who was vaccinated and who was
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
not um is yeah I can certainly tell you
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
the ages and by far the age group with
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
the highest proportion of deaths are
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
those 85 and older we know that that's
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's who really died we also saw over
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
time in terms of cases and illness you
 
01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
know there were times where even a sort
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
of what I called working age adults
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
people who look like me were also
 
01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
getting sick because we were out and
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
about um more than say the population of
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
65 to 75 or 65 to 80 that tended to be
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
more conservative in their interactions
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
people were out and about you know had
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
more cases and sometimes became more ill
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
and and hospitalized especially if they
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
had chronic diseases um vaccinated or
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
not um that data becomes a little bit
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
more tricky to get and I I need to go
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
back and talk to the epidemiologists
 
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
again because we don't have the death
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
record does not say whether you're
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated okay I was just wondering if
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
that was something that was readily
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
available um but a breakdown I think of
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
the deaths of the age groups I think
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
would be a telling and I guess and I
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
don't know as you said you can kind of
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
almost group them like at first it was
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
like between uh you know January 2020
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
and March 2020 for say you know the
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
highest group was this age group and
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
this age group also I don't know if
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's something I don't want to place a
 
01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:20.599 align:start position:0%
ton of burden on you but I didn't know
 
01:02:24.029 --> 01:02:24.039 align:start position:0%
how accessible that was um to do sure we
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
certainly have available right now you
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
can Google it on our covid-19 you just
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
Google New Hampshire DHHS covid-19 and
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
those dashboards are all available and
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
you'll see the this is the little line
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
of deaths that go up and down over the
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
course of the Year you'll see that
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
December January time and it'll come
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
down in December January time and it'll
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
come down and you so you can see both
 
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and deaths over time we
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't have that trend line Broken Out by
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
age but we do have other data available
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
and so if you have a specific ask we can
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
follow up afterwards and and we can run
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
that data for you but I encourage
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
everyone you know there was a time we
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
all looked at that covid-19 dashboard a
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
lot most people have forgotten it
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
existed it's still up there um we don't
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
update it every day but we do update it
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
routinely um and it provides a lot of
 
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
information I have to thank um uh our
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
friends from the hospitals I know that
 
01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:17.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Hospital Association
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
is behind me um they provide a weekly
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
report on hospitalizations because those
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
are no longer um uh covid does not have
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
to be reported to the Department of
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services anymore but
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
they provide us an aggregate again that
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
trend line of what hospitalizations are
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
so we can be prepared if we start seeing
 
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
them inch up we saw it inching up um we
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
saw capacity in hospital inching up even
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
this Christmas New Year's time we were
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay but many of us were on pins and
 
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
needles much like last year we saw it
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
inch up for Pediatrics for RSV where we
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
actually really got to a very critical
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
spot of the number of pediatric beds in
 
01:03:59.549 --> 01:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
the state not covid but in
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
RSV uh thank you for that um another
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
question I have is early on when people
 
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:09.559 align:start position:0%
were being hospitalized
 
01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
um for whatever reason I I my dad was
 
01:04:16.349 --> 01:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
one of those in April of 2020 he did not
 
01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:18.200 align:start position:0%
have covid but he was
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
hospitalized fortunately for us the EMT
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
said make sure you take your cell phone
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
in charger um what was most distressing
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how this guidance came
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
up um was the fact that loved ones
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't get in to see the the patients
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
that were very sick um
 
01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
even uh
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
in I'm not sure in New Hampshire but in
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
another state uh as late as even
 
01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
2021 uh with parents that were you know
 
01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
dying uh getting siblings to get into to
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
see them for the last last time was
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
pretty tough how
 
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
did and I don't know if DHHS had
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
anything if your department had anything
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
to do with that guidance at the hospital
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
level or if that was um the hospitals
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
himself or was that Homeland Security uh
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
could you sure it certainly wasn't
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security um so they're off the
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
hook for that um from DHHS we have no
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
regulatory control over the hospital so
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
there was no regulation that we put in
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
place around that um the hospitals made
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
decisions we provided recommendations at
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
times around infection control and I you
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
know I want to First say how um I know
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
yourself and so many people who had
 
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
loved ones in the hospital in 2020 how
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
difficult that was my I had a relative
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
as well who passed away um in a in a
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
facility and unable to be attended by
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
the people that love her um and that was
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
hard for for all of us and part of that
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
is it's it's complicated so it was a
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
question of how is this spread do you
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
have enough PPE do you need to conserve
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
the PPE for the nurses and the doctors
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
that are in that space and so you know
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
what I would simply say is um those
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
systems made the best decisions with the
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
information that they had at hand and
 
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
over time change those policies I think
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
this is as I said covid was traumatic
 
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
for all of us at times and things
 
01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:24.839 align:start position:0%
changed and at as we had more
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
information things
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
changed um and and thank you for that
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm very sorry that that happened uh
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
to your family um but my other question
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
along that lines is you you mentioned
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
that you issued guidance about the
 
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
infections to the hospital system is
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
that correct yes okay um and in that
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
guidance would it have stated anything
 
01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
about limiting access to those patients
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
I would have to go back and look at that
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
guidance to see what it said exactly one
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
of the things I I um recommend to all of
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
you if you're interested in where quite
 
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
frankly we got many of these data points
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
today um on the DHHS website is this
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
those Health alert networks those Hans
 
01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:10.119 align:start position:0%
and so you can go through and see what
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
guidance was throughout and we were
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
issuing Hans almost weekly at some point
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
so there are many many Hans very
 
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
detailed with the guidance that came out
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
at the time okay um the the um
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is is
 
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
um at a county level dealing with the
 
01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:31.750 align:start position:0%
um at a county level dealing with the
nursing

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
homes um we were seeing a large
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
um they were having issues because they
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't let people into to do work or
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
even deliver product if they couldn't
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
prove that they were
 
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated do you know where that
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
guidance came from some of that guidance
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
was CMS guidance
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um and the other that's
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
centers for Medicaid and Medicare just I
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
hate speaking in acronyms I'm sorry it
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's okay I'm I'm not in the medical uh
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
field so thank you for clarifying that
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
for me um uh I do and my nephew is one
 
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
of the people at uh in charge of one of
 
01:08:18.030 --> 01:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
the National Guard sites so I know how
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
now in regards to the schools did you
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
provide the guidance to the governor for
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
the shutting down of schools or was that
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
something CA that came down from federal
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
I think you also mentioned Homeland
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
Security might have had something to do
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
with that can you kind of expound on
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
that a little bit again I will let you
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
when director buckon can come in and and
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
speak for Homeland Security that'll be
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
great um we uh you know the governor
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately made his decisions for his
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
executive orders he consulted with many
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
individuals um he consulted of course
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
Services with Dr Chan with commissioner
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
shanet at the time he consulted with his
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
um you know resources ac across the
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
decisions representative Belcher thank
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh just a couple more
 
01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
that came up while this was all going on
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh first just based on that last
 
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
testimony you said TMS centers for
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or Medicare I'm no expert on
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is that a state or a federal agency
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's at the federal level Federal
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
agency excellent and uh one more if I
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
may um can you please speak to the sort
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
of States evolving understanding of the
 
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
threat of the co virus to minors and
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
children over time and if possible could
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
you compare it to the relative threat
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
posed by other illnesses such as cold
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
and flu as our sort of understanding of
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
alled sure and you know and and again I
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
would prefer to have someone like Dr
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
Chan speak to that he's a medical
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
provider I am not um I'm a trusty
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
bureaucrat uh but I what I will say is
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
um you know we as we didn't know about
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
anyone we did not know what the
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
long-term effects were going to be of
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
covid-19 on miners um as early on and
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
certainly as time went on WE gathered
 
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
more and more information and you know
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
as you saw even with vaccine roll out
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
the children the the children were the
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
last to be rolled out because they were
 
01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
at the least at risk or perceived to be
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
at least at least at risk that's how we
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
did our roll out we saw the deaths among
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
the oldest population but there were
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
many questions along the way about what
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
the long-term effects of covid-19 would
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
be on developing brains and develop we
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
knew that there were neurological
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
effects and so over time that evolved
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
again Dr Cham would be much better to
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
would thank you and just based on that
 
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
one one quick followup is and and I
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
think you're right that when you said
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
that we provided vaccines to Children
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
the latest point because at that time we
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
had some basic understanding that they
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
seem to be at the you know relatively
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
lowest risk for covid but can you speak
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
to the current um guidance from DHHS
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is still exists
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
that says children should still be
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
receiving the covid vaccine sure so our
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation says talk to your doctor
 
01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
and make that decision based on your own
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
family's risks and your child's risk
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
that Co you know for the record you know
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
put on the record covid-19 is not
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
required for school or Child Care entry
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
nor has it ever been required for school
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
or Child Care entry um each family has
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
their own different set of constellation
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
of both the the risk to the child
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
themselves as well as to risk to family
 
01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
household uh thank you uh so you
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned covid data
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
dashboard uh in the past uh there was
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
website uh uh covid 19. nh.gov
 
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
dasboard is it the same
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
thing because uh uh are you having a
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
difficult time finding so the way that I
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
get there the way that I get there very
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
very fancy is I just simply Google New
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DHHS co9 and you'll get a
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
link yes
 
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
yes and then you'll see data dashboard
 
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
Penza um does anyone else have any other
 
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
questions I have one last one for you so
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
so sorry um what oh represented C please
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
oh thank you um it may well be the same
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
one um I was just going to ask um
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
thinking back on on all of this is is
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
there knowing what you know now are
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
there what things do you think you would
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
do differently in terms of having us
 
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
prepared or I know it's like very hard
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
with with the hindsight um hindsight is
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
f what information would you have have
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
wished to have had earlier um and what
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
what are things we can do to sure you
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
know I think the homeland security after
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
action report will get to that if you're
 
01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
asking me personally I wish I had had a
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
stockpile of swabs for testing I wish
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
would have had a stockpile of masks um
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
those but in all honesty you know we
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about preparation and the
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
impacts to supply chains you know those
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
our plans were created in a time that
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
didn't have this sort of just in time
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
supply chain that we that exists for
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
toilet paper as well as for medical
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
supplies so those are things that are
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
huge lessons um you know the thing that
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
I would continue doing is always listen
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
to the community listen to a wide variet
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
iety of stakeholders and to be as
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
transparent as possible um and also to
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have the data that we
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
need and have the data infrastructure
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
licas yes I was wondering so I was
 
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
looking back on this timeline when did
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
Health Care Facilities mandate that
 
01:14:18.629 --> 01:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
their workers had
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines and do you have any idea why
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
they did that were there recommendations
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
or whatever that you know about sure so
 
01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
so certainly so I don't know that date
 
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head because we did
 
01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
not issue that mandate right um so but
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
it came out shortly after vaccines were
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
available so again in in um 2021 that
 
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
would be vaccines first came available
 
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
to healthcare providers in December of
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
2020 so 2021 was really early 2021 was
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
the roll out again I think I am not the
 
01:14:51.470 --> 01:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
expert here so you know I'm just going
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
to be uh you know you can find this out
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
Google it quicker than I can while I'm
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
sitting here but CMS also again centers
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
for Medicare and Medicaid had some
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
regulation and some thought around
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
vaccines um and healthc Care Systems
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
were doing the best they could to
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
support their patients and their other
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
staff so one of the things we did not
 
01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
talk about here is really the whole
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
impact on Workforce it's outside of the
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
scope of this committee we have all
 
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
lived and breeded that and I know that
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
our colleagues at hospitals and
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities were just
 
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
struggling as their staff were
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
you I have one last question um and I'm
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
not sure if it's the purview of DHHS but
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the lockdowns basically of
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
public nursing homes um was that part of
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
your purview or was that some was
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.990 --> 01:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
guidance uh there was Federal guidance
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
at that point as well that um those
 
01:15:59.550 --> 01:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
long-term care facilities were beholden
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
to um and we were working closely with
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
them throughout but again we can bring
 
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
back more information I don't want to
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
misre something it's been a long journey
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
so I have some dates in my head but I do
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
not have all of
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
them any other
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
questions um I have one last one for you
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
um based on this timeline and uh we will
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
have director buckton will be in uh at
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
the end of March hopefully um is there
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else that you think that we
 
01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
should have in to kind of complement the
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
timeline and as you saw the variety of
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
questions that we the committee is
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
asking who you would suggest would be um
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
able to get to the heart of the
 
01:16:52.110 --> 01:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
questions most efficiently so um I think
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
any well-formed
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
um questions and you've had a number of
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
questions today and and with the chair
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
if you can think about forming those um
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
I think we can be helpful at suggesting
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
who could answer those particular
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
questions I think the experience of
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
long-term care and hospitals is really
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
important and you should hear from them
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
they were on the front lines in a way
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
that was very different than many of
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
us thank you again so much I I
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um and I would ask the
 
01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee if you have any questions uh
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
for uh Miss Tilly to forward them to me
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
so that they can be done under one email
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh if anything is too cumbersome
 
01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
um for the Department just let me know
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much thanks for the
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here thank you very
 
01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
much uh is there anyone in the audience
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
that would like to speak to the timeline
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
committee okay well I want to want to
 
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
thank everyone for being here and
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
um based I know that we are missing uh a
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
few members um but I'd like to uh have
 
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
with the committee uh discuss uh what
 
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
you feel should be some of the the next
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
few topics that we should be tackling um
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to hear from
 
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
you representative pitz uh I I don't
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
know if it's in order but uh uh uh since
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh were mentioned and I'm
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
seeing representative from Hospital
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
Association is here so I just wonder
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
what would be the appropriate question
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
for us to figure out how the best we can
 
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh direct questions to Hospital
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
Association when we have some and um
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
maybe ask uh Ju Ju Just One Day about it
 
01:18:58.590 --> 01:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
if we need to figure out it
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you represent beler thank
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and what I would
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
recommend based on what I've seen for
 
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
the last two weeks now is that we may be
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
consider um doing our topic based on who
 
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
is available to testify on a given day
 
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
so we can formulate those questions
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and have sort of a for
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
instance if we could get um uh
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
the um DHHS and we could look at the
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
sort of orders that were involved and if
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
we can get uh do Chan or or uh other
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
medical professionals and we could go
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
over the the whole of the treatment
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
protocols and how the evolution of that
 
01:19:43.950 --> 01:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
worked okay thank you anybody else uh
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
have any uh suggestions or ideas repr
 
01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.950 align:start position:0%
have any uh suggestions or ideas repr
like

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
us schools I'm particularly interested
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
in schools schs how they made their
 
01:19:55.159 --> 01:19:57.310 align:start position:0%
in schools schs how they made their
decisions

01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
um how they decided and both this is
 
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
both public and private schools all and
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools because they all made
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
different decisions and what those
 
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
decisions were and what the outcomes
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
were from the decisions they made and
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
um in
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
and and even like public schools in two
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
different towns would open up a
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
completely different times how did they
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
make that
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
decision um what actually how did they
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
use the money that they got from the
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
federal government and what was
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
effective what they found was effective
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
and not effective so that we'll know in
 
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
the future what you know so we'll have a
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
better idea of if this happens again how
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
do we deal with that well I know we
 
01:20:49.149 --> 01:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
could probably approach the commissioner
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
of Education to come in but as far as
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
private schools I'm not sure exactly who
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
we would contact because they are
 
01:20:59.910 --> 01:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
considered private schools um could we
 
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
could we ask like whoever the head or a
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent or whatever head of a
 
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
somebody from the ask them if they could
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
send us somebody who could talk about
 
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
what their responses were because I mean
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
we can learn from everybody right right
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
well we can I can reach out if anyone
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
has uh a person at a private school that
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
they would specifically like uh to reach
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
Charter um the
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
um charter schools are also governed by
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
public guidance um I believe they would
 
01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
have to kind of follow they have some
 
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
leeway uh you know to go so we can try
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
and reach out to maybe a couple of
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
different charter schools that maybe
 
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
handle it differently uh we know that
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
the private schools definitely handled
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
the whole situation differently and from
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
and from um Public Schools very
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
differently from town to town so to to
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
get a variety some who opened early some
 
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
who didn't some who did lexic glass some
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
who didn't some who you know just to get
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
an idea of what their responses were
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
what they did how effective it seemed to
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
be you know so that we can compare the
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
responses so I could reach out to the
 
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent in Town um to see if he
 
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
is available I don't know if anybody
 
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
else has anybody uh
 
01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
that uh so representative prender if you
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
could uh help with the private school uh
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
reprentative cratan is there anything in
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
particular that uh you would like to see
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
discussed or have somebody in here yeah
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what I missed with the
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
the first meeting so apologies for that
 
01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm definitely curious to know how um
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
as air quality has become something that
 
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
that we've been thinking about more um
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons but especially
 
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
transmissible diseases um where how far
 
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
we've come in terms of that and how
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
quickly that happened and what have been
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
the blockers to to getting that
 
01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
happening um I think I think the school
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
system would be a great place to start
 
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
because in schools especially but also
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
public buildings and like you know
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings congregate housing
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
yeah just kind of okay
 
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere but yes especially school but
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
but I think I think if we the schools
 
01:23:25.229 --> 01:23:25.239 align:start position:0%
were one of the first to uh according to
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
the timeline were affected by all of
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
this so I think uh and I would be
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
interested to know which schools have um
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of the dollars that
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
they've received to put in air
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
filtration systems and which have not I
 
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
think that uh would be very telling um
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
so uh is there a a representative um
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
beler just printed out um
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
some of the executive orders um to go
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
over uh that you can take a look at that
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
came out in a timely fashion so that
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
they can kind of be seen along with uh
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS so uh
 
01:24:24.669 --> 01:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
we'll all
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
share I have
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
six oh this is four oh yeah I have okay
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
okay take all right yeah we can do that
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
after if you want well no you might have
 
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
questions this isn't this isn't nearly
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
all there's over a 100 emergency and
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
executive just yeah so there's six of
 
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
there uh if you can pass six one of
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
these down to uh represent cratan that'd
 
01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:50.910 align:start position:0%
these down to uh represent cratan that'd
be

01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:58.750 align:start position:0%
 
here's

01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
here's
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
five four
 
01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.750 align:start position:0%
five four
there

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
there well we're Lear we're learning how
 
01:25:10.239 --> 01:25:11.629 align:start position:0%
there well we're Lear we're learning how
to

01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:11.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
count I'm doing four six eight they
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%

we already have five over
 
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.629 align:start position:0%
we already have five over
here

01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
okay four five six I already have all
 
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:39.320 align:start position:0%

these that's
right

01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
nine

01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay four we already have
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:26:01.390 align:start position:0%
okay four we already have
four

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.709 --> 01:26:03.719 align:start position:0%
four were both those gentlemen from the
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
new hampire Hospital Association I'm not
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
themselves four why does this four look
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
different than that
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
four it's it might be an emergency
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
versus because it's not the same thing
 
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
order oh
 
01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.639 align:start position:0%
my very confusing got to put them in two
 
01:26:31.639 --> 01:26:40.629 align:start position:0%
my very confusing got to put them in two
buckets

01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:27:03.189 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
addiction are we looking at is that part
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
at it's so hold on I'll will read you
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
just so you have a better
 
01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
I okay
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
let me just get in
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
there so it say this is what we're
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
basically looking at it says that the
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
areas of focus will include the
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
administration of federal guidance
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
acceptance of federal funds and
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
implementation of the emergency use
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
authorization vaccination efforts so I
 
01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:45.470 align:start position:0%
authorization vaccination efforts so I
don't

01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:29:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
simple

01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
Madam chair if I may you may
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative beler thank you very much
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
um so I what I've handed out I've I've
 
01:29:45.229 --> 01:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
we couldn't possibly in the short notice
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
print all of them there's over 150 uh
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
PDF files of orders what I did was I
 
01:29:54.109 --> 01:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
selected the sort of initial period of
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
executive orders so executive orders
 
01:29:58.510 --> 01:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
going I believe roughly through July or
 
01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
August of 2020 to get a sort of the
 
01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
flavor of what we're looking at in terms
 
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
of what the executive orders were at
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
that time and also a selection of the
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
emergency orders um that seem to be
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
things that would be somewhat of
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
interest to the committee even if only
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
tangentially and just to speak to the
 
01:30:17.830 --> 01:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
issue of the evictions it's it's clearly
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
not a strictly medical item but as the
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
covid-19 response efficacy committee I
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
think we have a little bit of perview to
 
01:30:31.229 --> 01:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
look at all covid-19 responses
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
especially since this particular
 
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
guidance I know came from the
 
01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
CDC so it was it was within that sort of
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
Realm I don't know that we need to get
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
deep into the economic issues but it's
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
sort of a tangential topic that we can
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
it it puts the whole picture together
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that I mean I have uh
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
the de Department of Employment Security
 
01:30:57.109 --> 01:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
is of also of interest to me because at
 
01:30:59.070 --> 01:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
the time I was getting three to four
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
fraudulent uh applicants a
 
01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:04.149 align:start position:0%
fraudulent uh applicants a
week

01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
um and I you know there was a lot of
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
fraud trying to be committed I believe I
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
caught all of them but um I had to go
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
digging through records five and six
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
years back um which really put a burden
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
on businesses so that is I mean if we
 
01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
have time to look into those other
 
01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
things I think they're important um and
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
they could probably be of use that
 
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
guidance could be of use in a report
 
01:31:38.790 --> 01:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
um to maybe uh talk about those things
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
and how when we do a blanket approach on
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
something that uh it can have adverse
 
01:31:49.109 --> 01:31:49.119 align:start position:0%
effects um representative beler thank
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
you I just one more thing I forgot to
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
mention when it came to the the eviction
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
moratorium that was CDC guidance uh that
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
because there's been some time now since
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
these things occurred that went all the
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
way to the Supreme Court and was in fact
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
ruled illegal by the Supreme
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
Court well I I thank you for that
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
information and and thank you for
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
letting us know about the Supreme Court
 
01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:13.750 align:start position:0%
letting us know about the Supreme Court
decision

01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so I mean you know and right here on
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
this executive order
 
01:32:23.109 --> 01:32:23.119 align:start position:0%
2020-4 it says s whereas beginning in
 
01:32:23.119 --> 01:32:24.590 align:start position:0%
2020-4 it says s whereas beginning in
December

01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
December
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
2019 um you know it starts immediately
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh and that kind of follows through um
 
01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
timeline that um Miss Tilly printed out
 
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
for us um so we can look at these
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
executive orders in C be and you know
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
what I thought was great with the
 
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
timeline just is the color coding for me
 
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
um because you know if it was a national
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
event or a dhh event or a state
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
government event I think that was is
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
really important um to note because it
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
looks like sometimes they overlap um and
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
uh so you can see where there's a lot of
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
overlapping um and I think if we want to
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
look at the executive orders and how
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
they Define the you know the draft um
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mi uh Miss Tilly uh represent Penza
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
has another question if you wouldn't
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
mind I'm not sure uh does it pertain to
 
01:33:39.639 --> 01:33:40.550 align:start position:0%
mind I'm not sure uh does it pertain to
the

01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.270 align:start position:0%
the
timeline

01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
timeline
 
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so in the timeline you
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
had mentioned um you were talking about
 
01:33:49.950 --> 01:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
deaths and things like that so um so
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
this came out in there was a a lot of us
 
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
that were really looking at this closely
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
um so it came out December 28th in 2020
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
and um so it was one statistic of course
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
that came from covid-19 this was in the
 
01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
union leader so 80% of New Hampshire
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
covid-19 deaths four of every five had
 
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
maed residents of long-term care
 
01:34:09.870 --> 01:34:09.880 align:start position:0%
facilities according to state and
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
federal data that percentage is twice
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
the national national average so in
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
state-by-state color-coded maps the P
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
nursing home desk New Hampshire was
 
01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
pronounced um as like number one uh okay
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
yes leading so in 2020 early in 2020 yes
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
well or 2020 yeah um it was actually at
 
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
the end of 2020 when this early in the
 
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic is what I should have said
 
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
okay2 um I'm just I want to understand
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
because per capita based you know we
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
were the leading in regards with nursing
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
homes so I don't want to Pat ourselves
 
01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
on the back in in regards with that so
 
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
what about if you look at those ner the
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
the data for 3,300 deaths is that just
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
an overall death rate or is that is that
 
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
are you doing it based upon per capita
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
with population the the 3,300 is the
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
number so it's not a rate it's just the
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
raw number of deaths and so we break
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
that down by ages um I'm not sure that
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
we break it down by long-term care
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
facilities anymore we could look at that
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm actually not clear about that one of
 
01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
the things I will note about that
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
proportion because it was a rate it was
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
a proportion um we didn't experience
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
deaths in other places so we had deaths
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
the deaths were in the long-term care
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
facilities other states experienced many
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
more deaths among adults that were not
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
in long-term care we had fewer deaths
 
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
outside of long-term care so that that's
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
part of what makes that data point um
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
complex and and and represent penzer I
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
think that once she's going to do a
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
breakdown for us by age I think that
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
will give us a good picture
 
01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
of um what is going on because we're
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
going to get the age you know the 3,300
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
deaths I mean I want to know how many
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
young kids are part of that 3,300 how
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
many in their 20s um I mean I think it's
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
important to have those numbers um by by
 
01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
age population and I believe Miss Tilly
 
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
said that uh she would uh provide that
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
to the committee yes that's that's
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
easily available and those proportions
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
shifted over time too so again 2020
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
early in the pandemic the deaths were by
 
01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
far were in long-term care facilities we
 
01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
didn't have as many deaths among adults
 
01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
that were not in long-term care
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
facilities as other states had we can
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
maybe recall um news images of like New
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
York City where you know the hospitals
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
were just filled with people in the
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
hallways that were dying we did not
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
experience that early in the pandemic
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
our greatest area and and again I want
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
to completely underscore those deaths
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
are important in the long-term care I
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to have anyone think that
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're being dismisses of them those were
 
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
important deaths those were important
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
people to people's families but that's
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
what we saw in the
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
beginning thank you um
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
so on that note and I know this I'm not
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
positive if this was a you know we
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
talked about CMS guidelines and things
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
like that um and CDC guidelines in Long
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
term care
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
facilities but my question would be
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
um because we were locking things down
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
and as we
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
know anytime kids return back to school
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you put them all it's like a petri
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
dish right um so is there anything that
 
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
could have been done differently to help
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
prevent the spread in nursing homes
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
because you may have one to four people
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
in a room and what would be interesting
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't know and I'm sure that this
 
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
data would be like really hard to get
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
is how in a nursing home was it all the
 
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
same people in a unit were they in
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
separate units I mean that would be
 
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
really interesting data I know it would
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
probably be difficult to have but that I
 
01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
think that data would be really tell
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
on how the spread happened in nursing
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
homes um so sure you know what I would
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
suggest to that um two things one um the
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
our division of Public Health still
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
works with long-term care facilities
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
when they have outbreaks again
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
individual reports of covid-19
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
individual cases are no longer reported
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
to us but if there's an outbreak that is
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
reported to the department and so they
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
still continue to this day in long-term
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
care facilities and other congregate
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
living facilities not to the degree that
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
it was but it it hasn't gone away um I
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
think what you're asking for um I'm not
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
aware of a you know a uh evidence-based
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
um scientific journal article on it that
 
01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
may exist that's just not off the top of
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
my head I can't recall one but I am sure
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
that there are individuals in the state
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
with the lived experience in
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
administering those those nursing homes
 
01:39:15.589 --> 01:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
who can talk to you about what that was
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
like and what they experienced um during
 
01:39:21.149 --> 01:39:21.159 align:start position:0%
that time we also at the division of
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
Public Health probably have some broad
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
Strokes that we could say about in when
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
investigating those outbreaks what our
 
01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
broad observations were again we don't
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
have a detailed report ready to go that
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
gives you definitive numbers but there's
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
certainly some observations that can be
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
drawn after looking at those um uh
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
outbreaks over time and also the
 
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
infection control policies that were put
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
in place you know everything from air
 
01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:50.119 align:start position:0%
filtration you know to your point
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
earlier to the mechanics of how do you
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
make sure not only for covid but you
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
just simply work on infection um control
 
01:39:58.990 --> 01:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's part and parcel of the
 
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
work of Public Health we do that for
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
covid we do that for everything
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
else represent
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
Penza so that's one area that um just
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
because of my husband I'm uh become kind
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
of an expert in uh is the air filtration
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
um my husband's in that space um so I
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
don't understand why and maybe you'll
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
know that information and this might be
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
a question for another time that should
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
have been the number one thing that we
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
did as a state in every single facility
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
hospital long-term care school um there
 
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
are tons of studies that talk about um
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
full fresh air coming in filtration
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
systems and literally zero cases of
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
covid I can I can give you every bit of
 
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:47.320 align:start position:0%
that data and I would love to know every
 
01:40:48.990 --> 01:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
dime nickel and Penny that has been
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
spent in New Hampshire on that I think
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
think that's the one thing we get all of
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
this Federal money in and that should
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
have been the first thing that we were
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
doing in all the County nursing homes
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
and all of that with the covid money and
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
in you know in some schools in straford
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
County where I'm a rep and you can tell
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a little heated about this because
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
it bothers me instead of taking the
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
money and using it for things like this
 
01:41:13.589 --> 01:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
we built a new roof and so you know in
 
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
the essence of if we're talking about
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
public health this is the number one
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
thing that we've known for
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
decades and you know this because you're
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
in this space right so so yeah so I'm
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
glad you asked it uh it's a you know
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of people that were
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
talking about it here too meaning like
 
01:41:32.189 --> 01:41:32.199 align:start position:0%
we got some old buildings here and stuff
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
like that you know I know there's one
 
01:41:37.629 --> 01:41:37.639 align:start position:0%
over here but that it is why we have air
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
filters and it's hard for those of us
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
who can't hear because now we have white
 
01:41:43.629 --> 01:41:43.639 align:start position:0%
noise machines everywhere exactly um you
 
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
know I I I will just underscore that
 
01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
certainly air filtration and air
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
handling um was part of the conversation
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
early on and um to your question about
 
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
funding this is the no pun intended the
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
million doll question because there were
 
01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
lots of different lines of federal
 
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
funding schools received their funds
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
directly or through the Department of
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
Education was not um and you know we
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
believe in local control in the state so
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
there are places where they made their
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
own decisions about what to do with some
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
of those resources it just it completely
 
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:18.199 align:start position:0%
it bypassed in a sense bypassed the
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
state it went direct so you're exactly
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
right thank you um and I I think that
 
01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
everyone on this commi committee would
 
01:42:28.109 --> 01:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
agree that air filtration is extremely
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
important and maybe part of the guidance
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
and in future would be figuring out what
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
the number one number two uh criteria to
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
help prevent illnesses and spreads like
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
air filtration and if they're receiving
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
money make that a
 
01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
mandate um I hate the word mandate uh
 
01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
just so you understand
 
01:42:52.239 --> 01:42:54.390 align:start position:0%
just so you understand
um

01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
but mandating that a public facility has
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
air good air filtration is good public
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
policy um and so I think uh this is a
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
good topic and I think uh this C you
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
know just having that out there and
 
01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
letting the public know that this is how
 
01:43:19.229 --> 01:43:19.239 align:start position:0%
dollars should dollars shouldn't be
 
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
spent when you get guidance on new
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
things they should be concentrating on
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
the health of the the public
 
01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.709 align:start position:0%
the health of the the public
first

01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:43:32.669 --> 01:43:32.679 align:start position:0%
um so uh but I don't know if the report
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
that's coming out will discuss things
 
01:43:39.390 --> 01:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
like that um but your
 
01:43:42.229 --> 01:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
thoughts I have a lot of thoughts um I'm
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
not sure that our after action will will
 
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
dive into that I don't know that again
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
director buckton is much more involved
 
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
in it than I am on that um you know I
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
can tell you from my experience sitting
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
on the governor's economic reopening
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
task force that as we talked with
 
01:43:58.390 --> 01:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
Industries reopening that air
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
circulation and air filtration was a
 
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
conversation that was had on many of
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
those calls for different types of
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
settings um and again those those calls
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
were really about the econom you know
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
the um economic reopening of businesses
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
and Industry not schools we did not
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
address schools in that particular realm
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
there were weekly calls with the
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
schools to answer their questions just
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
again to provide support to nurses so
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
they were not left out but they had
 
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
their own way much in the same way that
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
there were calls with Healthcare
 
01:44:33.589 --> 01:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
Providers every week um to again elicit
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the community and for us
 
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
to provide some resources and support
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
where we could but again the one of the
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
lessons of covid-19 and otherwise is air
 
01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
air handling is important and so we we
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
looked to you know oosha regulations and
 
01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
there are all sorts of other sort of
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
mechanical things that you can do to
 
01:44:57.629 --> 01:44:57.639 align:start position:0%
support that represent
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
pit thank you Madame chair uh it's more
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
a comment than a question but uh I agree
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
that a quality is important but uh I
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
think we need some data to Scientific
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
data to tell us like how much uh it
 
01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
helps and also like there are two
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
strategies uh uh and um again like
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
between science and other kinds of
 
01:45:25.629 --> 01:45:25.639 align:start position:0%
decisions but one
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
strategy uh was to try to delay new
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
cases in order to give more times to
 
01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.229 align:start position:0%
cases in order to give more times to
develop

01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
develop
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
treatment but another strategy would be
 
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
to identify for example if if uh school
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
age kids are
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
not vulnerable are not dying from Co in
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire maybe it would makes
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
sense the reverse approach to let covid
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
go through and let them quickly get
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
immunity and through that natural
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
immunity protect uh eventually those
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and be done with pandemic at
 
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
least in schools so there are also like
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
this approach like uh what is the cost
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
of delaying this new cases uh and maybe
 
01:46:18.719 --> 01:46:19.390 align:start position:0%
of delaying this new cases uh and maybe
we

01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:25.510 align:start position:0%
we
shouldn't

01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative leus do you have a
 
01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
question well I had a I've been making a
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
a little list of the things that we've
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
been coming up with um evolution of
 
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
testing hospitals schools air quality
 
01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.589 align:start position:0%
testing hospitals schools air quality
nursing

01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
homes I you
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
know what do I do with this list do we
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
have other people other things that we
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
Etc you know as we discussed early th
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
this topic is so broad but we have a
 
01:47:06.910 --> 01:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
finite amount of time to do things um so
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to tackle
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
things um one at a
 
01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:14.589 align:start position:0%
things um one at a
time

01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
um and we H we're going to have to kind
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
of look at uh what is
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
glaring and what is most important to
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
this committee obviously air quality is
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
important um but I would like to uh
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
speak to the gentleman real quick from
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Hospital Association
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
question oh I don't want you to
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
testify um but yes okay I will talk to
 
01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.669 align:start position:0%
testify um but yes okay I will talk to
you

01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
offline um but I will just say this I
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
think that maybe just so you understand
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming from that having some
 
01:47:57.870 --> 01:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of how the policies at
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
hospital were instituted uh would be
 
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful for this committee um
 
01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
I would like to get everyone's thoughts
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
think I think um having a hospital day
 
01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea um
 
01:48:24.910 --> 01:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
having both the gentlemen here and
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
potentially you know some of our
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
somebody from some of our major
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state because I think
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
we had some differences between how
 
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
different hospitals handle some
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
things I don't know I mean but having a
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
day that we've said okay today's
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital day like today was timeline day
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
right right and and I think included in
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
that could be uh nursing homes um
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
because they kind of go hand inand a
 
01:48:56.669 --> 01:48:56.679 align:start position:0%
little bit um public and County um so I
 
01:48:59.229 --> 01:48:59.239 align:start position:0%
think it's important to understand I
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
mean I know the struggles that my County
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
had um obviously during covid um and I'm
 
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
sure that every other County encountered
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
some of the same things and some of the
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
guidance that came down how it affected
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
them um
 
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
and what I guess the the bigger question
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
was is what could the state have done
 
01:49:30.510 --> 01:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
to mitigate some of those mandates to
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
make it easier for our County nursing
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
homes to operate and take care of the
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.550 --> 01:49:45.560 align:start position:0%
that is everyone in agreement of that
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay perfect um any other specific
 
01:49:52.589 --> 01:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
topics I I think uh having you know so
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
so far what I've heard is we want to
 
01:49:58.830 --> 01:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
have basically a health day basic I'm
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
going to call it a health day with
 
01:50:03.950 --> 01:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes um a day of
 
01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.149 align:start position:0%
hospitals and nursing homes um a day of
on

01:50:05.149 --> 01:50:05.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
education um
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have uh I got to
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
reach back out to director buckton but
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
he is here available the last uh Friday
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
in March um and that would basically
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
it is so that would take care of the
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
three Fridays in March that we are
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
currently scheduling the meetings we we
 
01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
scheduling one for March 8th March 15th
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
and March 29th March 29th will
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
definitely be in the morning at 9:00
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
a.m. um because that is when the
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
director is available the other two I
 
01:50:45.069 --> 01:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
will send out an email to see if to the
 
01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
group to see morning or afternoon on the
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
8th and the 15th what works best for
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
everyone do we
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
know do we know what who we want you
 
01:50:58.350 --> 01:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
know what days those what I we're going
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
to bring in those days I will reach out
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
to the the the people and see who is
 
01:51:06.510 --> 01:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
available on which day and that will be
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
determined um I can't speak I I don't
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
have their schedules and uh they would
 
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
have to let me know their
 
01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
availability does that work for
 
01:51:21.069 --> 01:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
everyone okay if is there any further
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
discussion that we need here this
 
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
morning okay I'll just say in terms of
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
scheduling um I would be also okay with
 
01:51:31.950 --> 01:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
if we did maybe like one day but longer
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
um might be easier than everyone getting
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
here like every Friday morning maybe a
 
01:51:41.109 --> 01:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
little bit well I I think I don't know I
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
I I think once you know the organization
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
day was pretty short this one but I
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
think once we start getting into if we
 
01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
do a health day I think I think that's
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to take a little bit longer and
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
education day we'll be looking at a lot
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
of different uh factors I mean we could
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
be looking at you know things like uh
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
special ed needs how they compared
 
01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic how they compared
 
01:52:05.790 --> 01:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
after you know things like that we could
 
01:52:07.629 --> 01:52:07.639 align:start position:0%
even bring talk about the air filtration
 
01:52:09.470 --> 01:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
in the schools and the guidance on that
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of things that can go
 
01:52:14.189 --> 01:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
into those topics so I think those days
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
will be longer but I think we needed to
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
have a timeline and really start asking
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
the questions to see which way we wanted
 
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
to go representative
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair I I I tend
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
to agree with that and I would just add
 
01:52:29.229 --> 01:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
that even though today has been a bit of
 
01:52:30.270 --> 01:52:30.280 align:start position:0%
a shorter
 
01:52:33.069 --> 01:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
day this day at least for me and I
 
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
suspect some of the other us is going to
 
01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
drive hours of further work putting
 
01:52:40.069 --> 01:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
together research putting together
 
01:52:42.189 --> 01:52:42.199 align:start position:0%
questions those questions will be then
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
forwarded on to the appropriate parties
 
01:52:46.589 --> 01:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
who will then drive the continuation of
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
this committee forward so I I would
 
01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
think it would be necessary um or at
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
least advisable to continue to meet on
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
roughly a weekly basis thank you uh
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bel I understand uh that
 
01:53:03.069 --> 01:53:03.079 align:start position:0%

session uh most of us aren on vacation
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
um but if there are any questions for
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
any of the Departments I would ask that
 
01:53:24.510 --> 01:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
everyone please send them to me and I
 
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
will forward them so that they're not
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
getting multiple emails from people um
 
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
so that we can streamline the process uh
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:41.719 align:start position:0%
