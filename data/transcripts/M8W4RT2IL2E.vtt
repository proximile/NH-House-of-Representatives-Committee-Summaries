00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
open our working session our work
 
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
session of division three
 
00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 align:start position:0%
um we really have
 
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 align:start position:0%
two actions today
 
00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 align:start position:0%
for the work session and I don't think
 
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 align:start position:0%
these are controversial because we we
 
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
discuss them
 
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh the the on the um first one
 
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
1193 the that's the amendment number
 
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's dealing with the transfers uh uh
 
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
from The Liquor Commission fund
 
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
and uh this language for those of you
 
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
that read all of these things very
 
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 align:start position:0%
carefully is
 
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 align:start position:0%
modify just a little bit because it met
 
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
the Departments you know wanted to
 
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
suggest slightly different language Mr
 
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
Ripple assures me that it doesn't change
 
00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
our policy or the concept it's just
 
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
happier words
 
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
so that that's though that's 1193
 
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
and then the other document that's
 
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 align:start position:0%
the issue we had with that full body
 
00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 align:start position:0%
scanner that we want to have the sununu
 
00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
center do is we we're going to put it in
 
00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
the footnote that they could move money
 
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 align:start position:0%
around but apparently that's
 
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional to basically uh put up
 
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
make a the effect of a law in a footnote
 
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
of hb1
 
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
so so it's the it's the same thing but
 
00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 align:start position:0%
it just has to be go live in hb2
 
00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.110 align:start position:0%
it just has to be go live in hb2
so

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
so I think that I'm going to ask for a
 
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
straw vote
 
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
on the hb2 item to approve the uh the
 
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
transfer Authority and the purchasing of
 
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
the full body scanner all or is there
 
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
could I actually ask a question about
 
00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 align:start position:0%
the look at one
 
00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
we'll get to that honestly right now I'm
 
00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 align:start position:0%
on the scanner
 
00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 align:start position:0%
yeah any questions or comments about
 
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
this no that's all right
 
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
um I you actually didn't miss anything I
 
00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
don't think this is very controversial
 
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
so so what what what what is happening
 
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
is we all agreed we want the body
 
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
scanner and we in in exchange for having
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
the body scanner at sununu we're going
 
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
to liberate their ability to to move
 
00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
money around between uh expense line
 
00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.369 align:start position:0%
money around between uh expense line
lines

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
they can't we can't do that in hb1 it's
 
00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 align:start position:0%
it's has the effect of a law and so we
 
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
have to put it in hb2 so so the one
 
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start position:0%
document you have on hb2 is exactly what
 
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
we agreed to but as an hb2 item do you
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
want do you want to say something about
 
00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 align:start position:0%
this Mr Ripple
 
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
that's actually that's exactly right uh
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
the courts have ruled that house bill
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
one can't contain any uh modifications
 
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
to or suspensions of state law so I
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
would request that you put this in the
 
00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill instead
 
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 align:start position:0%
um I'd like a show of hands those in
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
favor of accepting the the full body
 
00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 align:start position:0%
scanner at sununu in hb2 raise your hand
 
00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.390 align:start position:0%
scanner at sununu in hb2 raise your hand
please

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay just clarify I I agree
 
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
um it's this is just an unofficial draft
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
yes I didn't I thought of this too late
 
00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 align:start position:0%
uh to have OLS draft it but now that
 
00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
you've adopted it I'll have OLS draft a
 
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
so the next one uh representative erf is
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission fund transfer item
 
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
1193 do you have questions or comments
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious I was reading their
 
00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 align:start position:0%
audit this morning uh probably need Mr
 
00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 align:start position:0%
Ripple for this
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
I was learning the audit this morning
 
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission is this in any way
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
related to the fact that they didn't pay
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
the full amount or didn't transfer the
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
full amount into the uh
 
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
alcohol abuse thing I I don't think it's
 
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
so I think this is just executing what
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
we'd already agreed on so I I would like
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and see a show of hands on
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
who can accept this as
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
part of hb2
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay that's it and then you have a third
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
item for us that's for information I
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
understand yes you don't need to vote on
 
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
this you voted on it on Tuesday but I
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
have the revised rate increase Amendment
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
and although there's no vote go ahead
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
and take your time and just look at it
 
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
over and if you if you want to come back
 
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Lipman sir did you get a copy of The
 
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
Proposal okay
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple when we finish here
 
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
do I need to recess do we have anything
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
else outstanding that may come back over
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
I see no reason to recess
 
00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.510 align:start position:0%
I see no reason to recess
okay

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mooney
 
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so as we review
 
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1183 H as I recall from last
 
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
we met the critical sections are on page
 
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.930 align:start position:0%
we met the critical sections are on page
three

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
the insertion of Roman 19
 
00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
section three
 
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
so on page three that would be line 12
 
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
do we have the total of what this
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
document he can tell us again I I think
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
it was uh 70.4 plus 24. 70.2 plus 24
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
million over the over the biennium
 
00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:03.139 align:start position:0%
so 70
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
70.2 0.2 and 24. the 24 was the 3.1
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
percent base and then we allocated the
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
70.2 to help rate increases
 
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh so I just um uh want to make sure
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the department is
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
um and the language is clear to indicate
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
how they can use the 12 and 12. um uh uh
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
money's uh timing wise and to uh are
 
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
they target is there any formula for
 
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
targeting the rate rate increase in here
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh to individual areas or do they just
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
have uh total total discretion to use it
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
on on rates in any way that they see
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
based on this language thanks
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
I think our intent was to let them have
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
whatever flexibility they needed in
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that everyone got 3.1
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
percent that we didn't Overlook any
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
entity and that if anything popped up
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
the department could handle it obviously
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
excluding the hospital portion
 
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
that is correct I just would like to ask
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
one question though there was some
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
discussion back and forth that the
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
committee about
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
um DME and and the pharmacy issue I
 
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
think where you landed was this
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
where the governor talked about us for
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
services and I'm not sure this whether
 
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
the um this Clarity on those two pieces
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
for us uh
 
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
um but I think we can work with what's
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
here I think the clarity was we decided
 
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
to accept the governor's proposal around
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
DME and pharmacies that what what he was
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
recommending was what we're supporting I
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
it was there any other position on the
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think so okay thank you yes sir
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm sorry you all came in
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
because we're already done I could I
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
could read it back into the record how
 
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
great it is that I think we cooperated
 
00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:16.019 align:start position:0%
to to come up with a Medicaid rate
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
increase that met the community's
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
requests that used available funds to
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
the extent that we had them and that
 
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to give the Senate something
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
really useful to work with so so I like
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
all that so go ahead represent walner
 
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
all that so go ahead represent walner
well

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think we really actually met the
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
request of the providers I think we're
 
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
this document is considerably lower than
 
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
what the information they provided us
 
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%

during the snowstorm and they were put
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%

to fund the Merrimack New Hampshire
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer incidence phase 3
 
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
feasibility study I would look now for a
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
motion to retain with the intention of
 
01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:24.420 align:start position:0%

thank you and representative ER for a
 
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
second any discussion
 
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
okay at this point I would like to say
 
01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:45.980 align:start position:0%
that I prepared some remarks on this
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
Merrimack is home to the biggest pfas
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
pollution in New Hampshire and thousands
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
have been affected either receiving
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
bottled water which they continue to do
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
to this day
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
installing filtration systems or
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
suffering with extreme health effects
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
this bill funds the recommendation for
 
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
phase three of a feasibility study to
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
fund High rates of kidney cancer
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
it was brought out in the work sessions
 
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
on this bill that only two times
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 years has a cancer study
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
been recommended to go from phase two to
 
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
phase three
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
this is extraordinary
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
the whole interest in pfas is the
 
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
effects it has on our human bodies and
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
on our environment and this phase three
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
would certainly benefit us as a state as
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
to the effects this has on the human
 
01:12:49.679 --> 01:12:51.410 align:start position:0%
to the effects this has on the human
body

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
so to proceed with this phase from phase
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
two to phase three of the study
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars is needed
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
for fiscal years 24 and 25. two DHHS to
 
01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
contract and proceed with the study so
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's critically important not only to my
 
01:13:10.189 --> 01:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
community of Merrimack but to our state
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
as a whole that this bill be included
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
and passed as part of House Bill 2.
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
I also appreciate the fact that we're
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
finally moving into looking at humans
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
rather than rodents because all these
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
past things have not really involved
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
humans at phase three and we've got some
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the lowest pfast
 
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
um things set down for the water which I
 
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
think is unreasonable unless we do some
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
human studies thank you
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any further comment
 
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
at this point I do see representative
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
Nancy Murphy in the audience she wasn't
 
01:13:51.649 --> 01:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
able to make it to the work session
 
01:13:51.659 --> 01:13:52.689 align:start position:0%
able to make it to the work session
previous

01:13:52.689 --> 01:13:52.699 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
would you like to say any comments at
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Nancy Murphy
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 12 representing the town of
 
01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
Merrimack I really appreciate the
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
support for this this bill it's
 
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
something that we in the community about
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
27 000 people
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
um know was an issue the the numbers in
 
01:14:22.610 --> 01:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
our that cancer report actually are only
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
the numbers through 2018. so the
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
exceedings of I believe it was 19 cases
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
and with a 42 percent
 
01:14:30.719 --> 01:14:32.330 align:start position:0%
and with a 42 percent
over

01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
um you know what should be expected in
 
01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
terms of kidney cancer those numbers are
 
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
still much less than the reality of
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
what's happening so kidney cancer is
 
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
just one of the the health impacts that
 
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about and certainly
 
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
deserves you know this this feasibility
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
study and with ultimately probably an
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
epidemiological study for the reasons
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
you suggest that you know we're the the
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
need is not often found and it certainly
 
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
has been there given the exposure of our
 
01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
community that Merrimack is sort of
 
01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
Ground Zero for
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
um you know we've been designated these
 
01:15:11.689 --> 01:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
uh site of the state's largest
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
industrial environmental disaster in the
 
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
state's history
 
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:17.640 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's this this money would be
 
01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
really important to the division and to
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
to the the citizens Merrimack so I thank
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%

so at this point is there anything
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
further from the members of division
 
01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.870 align:start position:0%
further from the members of division
three

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:30.000 align:start position:0%

can we uh discuss at all what the
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
process looks like on uh on the hb1 hb2
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
um uh sessions on Monday and Wednesday
 
01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.709 align:start position:0%
um uh sessions on Monday and Wednesday
yes

01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler so we'll start
 
01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:13.370 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler so we'll start
with

01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
since we're in division three and you
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
know you don't get to rotate around as
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
much as I do we'll start with division
 
01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:21.790 align:start position:0%
much as I do we'll start with division
one

01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
and we'll see up there the chair and
 
01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:27.260 align:start position:0%
vice chair and likely the two
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
LBA folks that will be assisting and
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
they'll start through the major points
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
as they go through
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
the different departments and the
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
different changes they made in briefing
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
us on what they did in the actions they
 
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
took as well as likely probably some of
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
the HBS that have been incorporated into
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
the budget and so we'll all have an
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
understanding of what happened within
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
that division
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
that will take some time and then we'll
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
go on to division two similar thing and
 
01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
then division three and we'll all we'll
 
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
all get filled in on what
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
um and if if someone on division three's
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
leaves out something you think is
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
important you can
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
get get the attention and say hey don't
 
01:18:10.199 --> 01:18:10.970 align:start position:0%
get get the attention and say hey don't
forget

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
forget
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
what we did about so and so so that's
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
important that everybody they'll
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
allowable to be some other members of
 
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
the legislature I've invited them as you
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
heard and uh also maybe members of the
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
public and it will be telecast so it'll
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
go out and it will be kind of a
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
lengthier version of what we will do
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
when we present it in April to the Full
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
House and again it'll be division chairs
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
will get up Vice chairs and and kind of
 
01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
give a description for
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
for some amount of time we don't haven't
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
decided yet of what took place I don't
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
think the Full House will listen for
 
01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.430 align:start position:0%
think the Full House will listen for
hours

01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
as we will probably have it here and uh
 
01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
when we go through it but uh
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the purpose of it all and
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
then any other members that will come
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
before us I may still have another
 
01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.250 align:start position:0%
before us I may still have another
meeting

01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
tonight about uh
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
what we're wrapping up for those it's
 
01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
been several members that come in that
 
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
want to know what happened someone be
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
likely having that meeting so anyway
 
01:19:16.679 --> 01:19:18.169 align:start position:0%
likely having that meeting so anyway
that's

01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's a sales job we have to let people
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
know that this is what we did
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
and we hope you support it and and
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
listen to see what the comments are or
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
questions and do our best to answer them
 
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
all so you know we're looking for
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
support on the budget from everybody on
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
the on the committee and from all the
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
members of the house so
 
01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
we can send something on to the Senate
 
01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060 align:start position:0%
that we feel has a strong support thank
 
01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.130 align:start position:0%
that we feel has a strong support thank
you

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walner
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Weiler would
 
01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
Monday as we're working on the reports
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
from each division would that be a time
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
that people could bring forth amendments
 
01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.630 align:start position:0%
that people could bring forth amendments
yes

01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.209 --> 01:20:08.219 align:start position:0%
and it'll be an exact session in effect
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
so we'll have the full committee here to
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
vote on it
 
01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
so I guess that leads me to ask Mr
 
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:19.260 align:start position:0%
Ripple at some point between now and
 
01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:21.659 align:start position:0%
Monday and I would assume that every
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
division would be in this situation a
 
01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
list perhaps of all of the changes
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
amendments takeouts put-ins and the like
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 2 from this division so
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
the two documents that we generally
 
01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
provide are a house bill 2 Amendment
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
packet containing all the house bill two
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
amendments that you passed along with
 
01:20:42.110 --> 01:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
the summary sheet on the front and for
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
House Bill one we'll provide what we
 
01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
call a detailed change document showing
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
all the line by line changes that were
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
made to the budget and so we'll finalize
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
those probably later tonight or tomorrow
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
and typically send them to the chairman
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
first so we can review them for a
 
01:21:01.729 --> 01:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
real good any further discussion
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
okay with that I think we're ready to
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
close our work session today in division
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
three thank you all
 
01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
