00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
open work session and recess it until he
 
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.840 --> 00:07:50.149 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh reopen I
 
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
guess HP
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
1183 and uh
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
so uh sponsor you weren't able to make
 
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.270 align:start position:0%
so uh sponsor you weren't able to make
the

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
hearing but um this is a subcommittee so
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
we're really not going to be taking
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
testimony per se but I guess I'd like to
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
hear your rationale
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
why we should pass this
 
00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
when I've heard concerns that they U
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
that some people up in the north country
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
are very worried about American
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
companies are buying Forest land for the
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of solar or get for energy
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
logging so should we be doing that to
 
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:43.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
too okay so let me for the record my
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
name is Ted Gorski I represent Hillsboro
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
District 2 uh which is Bedford New
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let me
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
first and provide you some information
 
00:09:00.269 --> 00:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
on this and come back to your
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
question this particular bill right now
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
China owns roughly 380,000 acres of land
 
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
US and the
 
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.710 align:start position:0%
US and the
USDA

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
USDA
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
is responsible for getting uh reporting
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
requirements after 90 days after a
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
transaction is done but have no
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
authority to investigate these
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
transactions the USDA cannot rely ably
 
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
report information to where and how much
 
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
agricultural land is held by Foreign
 
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
entities this was a report recently that
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
Congress AAL Hayes who is the director
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
of National
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
Intelligence stated recently that quote
 
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
the Communist CH Chinese party
 
00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
represents a leading threat to our
 
00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:55.630 align:start position:0%
represents a leading threat to our
national

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
national
 
00:09:58.269 --> 00:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
security this whole purpose of this bill
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire farmlands protect
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire families because the
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal one potential motivation
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
is for the CCP to buy
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
Farmland harvest the
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
crops send them to
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
China also their Al potential ultimate
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
goal is to take control of the food
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
supply chain and I recently had a couple
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
of auto dealers that I spoke with who
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
had an issue
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh last year getting chips for vehicles
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
and they basically told me that Ted If
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
you walked into my dealership
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
today you cannot I cannot give you a new
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
C for approximately four to six months
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
and that was because the common Chinese
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
party really owned the chip
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
Market we cannot allow that to happen to
 
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.350 align:start position:0%
Market we cannot allow that to happen to
our

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
farmlands this has to we have to protect
 
00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
our farmlands and and our critical
 
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.269 align:start position:0%
our farmlands and and our critical
infrastructure

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
entities so uh Mr chairman if you can
 
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
repeat your question regarding the
 
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
logging okay but I would first tell you
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
that your these auto dealers are
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
confused um the chips are coming from
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
Taiwan not the People's Republic of
 
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
China okay second of all um the question
 
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
China okay second of all um the question
was

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
basically um if if
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
uh terms of the we we haven't had any
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
reports that the Chinese are buying any
 
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
land in New Hampshire true and and we
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
actually have a concern about these
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
other companies who are buying land in
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and actually being a
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
disservice to our state's
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
economy and so the problem is not
 
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
Chinese the problem is
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
Americans so
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
why would we want to pass this
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
legislation M when we're not even
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
addressing the real problem in the state
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
first of all this is this particular
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
bill is to kind of be ahead of what's
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
happening because chines because the CCP
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
is not buying Farmland right now doesn't
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
mean that they will not there are 15
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
states that already passed legislation
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
which protects the farmlands and
 
00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:29.079 align:start position:0%
critical entities in our in their states
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
so we can't put our head in the sand and
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
say okay because they haven't purchased
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
any here now meaning that it never will
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
happen we should be ahead of the game to
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
protect the farmlands in this
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
state and in regards to your question on
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
the logging and the other critic the
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
American companies this particular bill
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
was more focusing on foreign entities
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily us
 
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
companies in the
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
state well I just say personally I'm not
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
big on uh in the immortal words of uh a
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
former chairman of the finance committee
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
um prophylactic
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
legislation um generally we want to put
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
legislation we want to solve a problem
 
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
that's happening not something that
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
could happen or potentially happen
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
because if we did that we would be
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
cluttering the law books with lots and
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
lots of statutes which in the land that
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die that seems to be an
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
anathema so I personally um not too
 
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
interested in passing this bill but I am
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
certainly uh willing to interim study it
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
and hold it so that uh if there at some
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
point in time we did find that there
 
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
somebody you know that this was going to
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
be a problem in the state at least we
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
would have a vehicle in which we could
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
address the problem with I think Mr
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
chairman I think what's important is we
 
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
have a conversation about this exactly
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we uh protect our our
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
assets here in the state by interim
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
setting it we would have that same
 
00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:59.310 align:start position:0%
setting it we would have that same
effect

00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.269 align:start position:0%
effect
representative

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
spear uh this this may be a would you
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
believe but it may be a question well
 
00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not we're not this is not a
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
hearing so this is all right then I can
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
say would you believe if I want to you
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
don't even have to bother saying it you
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
can say whatever you want this you're
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually entitled to your opinion now
 
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
actually entitled to your opinion now
yeah

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
finally uh having come from New York and
 
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
lived in New York City a lot of my
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
original part of my
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
life uh at one point or another the
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
Chinese have own the Empire State
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
Building Arab countries have owned the
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
Empire State Building as other Asian
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
countries India everybody's owned the
 
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
Empire State Building and it was the end
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
of the world every single time they
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
owned it everybody was getting oh my God
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to tear it apart they're
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
going to do this and nothing ever happen
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
so I kind of agree with you unless we
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
see where this is
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
going I I don't I've seen things happen
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
in the past where it didn't happen just
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
because someone thought it might happen
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
this is land they can't take it away and
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
at any time the United States can find
 
00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:05.189 align:start position:0%
at any time the United States can find
reasons

00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
to you know kind of cancel out the the
 
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
sale for whatever legal reasons they can
 
00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:13.759 align:start position:0%
come up with so I I don't know I'm I'm
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
kind of like with you on this I I don't
 
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
think we should be uh acting
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
prophylactically as you put
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
it yes representative grassing yeah I I
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you as well I think that
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things is here is is that you
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
know reacting just to the Chinese coming
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
in and taking things is is not what we
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
should be looking at I think we have I
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
mean there are examples of like Saudi
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
Arabia buying land in out in the west to
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
plant alela draining all the water
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
resources and then taking that alela and
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
exporting it back to their country uh
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe what we need to do is you know
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
that this bill isn't the correct thing
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
to do but maybe what we need is some
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
sort of registry that the Attorney
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
General would have to be able to and and
 
00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:58.759 align:start position:0%
a time frame before any of our land is
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
swn to a foreign any foreign country um
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
over a certain size um that they need
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be reviewed um you know
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
that would be maybe be able to address
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
the concern that these folks here have
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
but um it's going to need a lot of work
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
this is not the
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
bill okay any other comments yes
 
00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:24.230 align:start position:0%
bill okay any other comments yes
representative

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
Walsh uh personally my opinion I think
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between a bill
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
building and farmland you know we need
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
to keep farmland and uh
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
as I think that's that's a different
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
level of importance versus a building so
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's just my humble opinion
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
yeah but we're doing a lousy job of
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
Hammond did just uh my thoughts on the
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
matter I think it's useful to have this
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.230 align:start position:0%
matter I think it's useful to have this
conversation

00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh China's our number one Global
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
adversary they're a communist country
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
they basically are behind every company
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
every Chinese company has a communist
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
cell within the company um there's
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
recent news
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
reports that in Maine uh Chinese
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
companies are buying Farmland to grow
 
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
illicit marijuana that's common
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
knowledge at this point I think and also
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
there's reports that they're buying
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
Farmland near uh military bases in the
 
00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:29.799 align:start position:0%
country so we don't want to put our head
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
in the sand and think that this isn't an
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
issue um maybe this bill needs work or
 
00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
maybe the conversation needs to continue
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
but I I thank the member for bringing
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
forward

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments let's see who
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
who do we have here that's from the
 
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
committee in the sub commmittee only
 
00:17:50.679 --> 00:17:53.150 align:start position:0%
committee in the sub commmittee only
half

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
myself

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
Cole Co
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
and here with grass SE actually because
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
he he's I've taken Sean
 
00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:15.350 align:start position:0%
he he's I've taken Sean
SP

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
so you're this a second year so so uh we
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't have retain anymore now we have
 
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.310 align:start position:0%
don't have retain anymore now we have
interim

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
interim
 
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.630 align:start position:0%
interim
study

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
so an interim study would mean that uh
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
we would you know meet again um next you
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
know by next fall in the fall and we
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
would then discuss you know where what
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
we think about this bill and at that
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
point um you either recommend or not
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
recommend for future
 
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
legislation and then the bill then the
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
bill could be reintroduced in the next
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
bium M Mr chairman another option the
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
committee has as well is have an ad hoc
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee um if we to report this as itl
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee could look take a
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
look at a much broader subject as far as
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
our agricultural I I generally don't
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
like to do that okay okay then I just to
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
me the interim study I don't know if you
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
there when we did that uh issue of study
 
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
committees yep and way what I testify to
 
00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
to the whole all the legislators is that
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
the in the Commerce Committee we like we
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
like inim study because interim study
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
means we have the bill it's in our
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
possession and we can frankly we can
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
have a ing on it at any time not not
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
many committees do that that's problem
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
that that is true that not many
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
committees do that but we we guarantee
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
we definitely will meet you know we'll
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
meet on by September we would meet and
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%

bill I mean it's a good idea we should
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
probably do this except that we have the
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
past bill coming up that's going to ban
 
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where to where to take
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
this no not really
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh no you're
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
right let's do it no we're not GNA do
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
that yeah it's my opinion that's the
 
00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:44.860 align:start position:0%
that yeah it's my opinion that's the
wrong

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:44.870 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.269 align:start position:0%
wrong
[Laughter]

00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
answer scient no it isn't because the
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.310 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bros I just was
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
reading your your text message to me
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
that I'd be
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
late um I actually GNA say something
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
that may surprise coming from um
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
somebody from my party but I actually
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
think that you know we keep having the
 
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
single use bills over and over and I
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
actually think it might be more
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
effective for stores to band together
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
and have a marketing program that we
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
don't have disposable utens
 
00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
I think that you know I think this you
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
know we we these have failed over and
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
over again you know and I I see this as
 
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
kind of being analogous to the GMOs
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
where they did a marketing you know
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's a label on it no GMOs and a lot
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
of consumers look for that and for me if
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
I and I'm I'm actually becoming much
 
00:23:49.149 --> 00:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
more conscious where I eat at lunchtime
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
because I don't want the plastic so if a
 
00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:53.559 align:start position:0%
store had that on their store we don't
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
have disposable um food wear I I'd
 
00:23:59.710 --> 00:23:59.720 align:start position:0%
probably go there more often
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
it's education yeah does that surprise
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
you um no because I think you're a very
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes and I think you're absolutely
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
right that that you know there's you
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
know there this you would think that a
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
an establishment would want to have a
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
sign and say if you don't need the all
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
this accruement please say no thank you
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
and and some are actually doing it I
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
mean I went to REI and I bought a bunch
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
of stuff and they said we don't have
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
bags which you know I thought was great
 
00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
you know I didn't know I was going to
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
get all my stuff out and they didn't
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
have carts but you know I I thought that
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
was great that they did that you know
 
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.190 align:start position:0%
was great that they did that you know
right

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
yep I mean I I've always been a big
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
believer and I think even I've been
 
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about this past bill that we
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
really want to empower the
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
consumer um because I just saw one of
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
the recommendations was just to remove
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
the the labeling require requirements
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm actually the complete opposite I
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
labeling is important that that that if
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
consumers I mean the biggest problem we
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
have with Pas is the consumers are
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
oblivious to it um but that that uh if
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
if you know if we did have like you said
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
the M you know the um modified the mg
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
what it was GMOs GMOs genetically
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
modified and I and I see it on cans all
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
the time and I've always wondered how
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
many people really say you know no thank
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
Shelf you because I think that that's
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
that is the right answer you know that
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
that you know empower the consumer to
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
say okay no I don't want that stuff but
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
I also still think in terms of the P has
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
Bill which is the Clearing House which
 
00:25:52.029 --> 00:25:52.039 align:start position:0%
is that companies have got to be more
 
00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:53.230 align:start position:0%
is that companies have got to be more
forthcoming

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
forthcoming
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
about the fact that it h whether it has
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
it or not because we can't where it's
 
00:25:59.389 --> 00:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
hard especially when if we're going to
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
try to ban the food packaging it's hard
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
to know whether that's GMO or not I mean
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
not GMO excuse me but it's p fast or not
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know that packaging it looks a
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
little mysterious looks a little
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
suspicious but we don't know you know
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
what you know what's really in there and
 
00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
that and that should be an obligation of
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
notify so um I mean how strongly are you
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
demon you know obviously you feel like
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
that you want interim study I mean you
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
kill this build then not even interim
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
study yeah I'll go along with what you
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
said it made made a lot of sense okay so
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
which is it interim study or or you want
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
to kill it I'd like to see it I'd like
 
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
to see it go to interim study because I
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
think there are certainly some other
 
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
options uh for single use instead of
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
plastic and uh there are um restaurants
 
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
and other companies that are using non
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
um oilbased or non-plastic based um
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
recyclable materials uh that or
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
compostable materials that could be used
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
instead and I think if we take a look at
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
this and maybe get it down to where we
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
can refine it to um that that we direct
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
people or direct or try to encourage
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
companies to not use plastic uh
 
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
materials throwaways but to use
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
compostable or uh non-plastic materials
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
instead so I'd like to inter and study
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
it okay yeah representative Amon yeah
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
I'll just give my Sense on this um to to
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
me this kind of uh triggers the idea
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
that uh it's a nanny State bill that
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
we're micromanaging what people can and
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
can't do um I put this up there with
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
banning plastic straws banning plastic
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
bags um but if there's a market-based
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
approach I think we heard that in our
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
testimony that there's a um there's a
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
group that goes around to restaurants
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
and uh encourages them to to not do this
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
and I mean doesn't mean it's a bad idea
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
I just don't like the idea of the
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
government Banning a common thing that
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
we all probably have in our kitchen
 
00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
drawer at home so um Banning abortion
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
subject if you want to go there we can
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
but we probably
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't okay actually I think that
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
when you think about it because we also
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
have the the bottle
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
Bill and in the bottle Bill we did
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
um we've got the Private Industry to you
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
know get create the blue bags and and
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
and really make an awareness for people
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
um you I think the blue bag is an
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
awesome awareness when you drive by and
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
you see that and you see all the how big
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
stuff full of stuff in there it makes
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
you aware that you know how much is is
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
ending up on the side of the roads
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that that if you when in
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
general we if we use these these bills
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
as a vehicle to try try to impress upon
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
um the merchants and markets and and
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
help uh somehow help help them educate
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
the consumer how important it is you
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
know to to you know don't don't take
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
it uh I don't know whether the blue bags
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
have past in them that's a good
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.830 align:start position:0%
have past in them that's a good
question

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
well but again this is where I'm saying
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
that that really what we really want
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
with the p is you know is is in terms of
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm a little concerned how
 
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
enforce the past bill but that if if if
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
the issue comes down to is if you got p
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
in it you need to let people know it
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
should be stamped right on on anything
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
that has p in it we should know that it
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
has p in it if we're going to talk about
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
P I really think we're going to have to
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
we're not really talking about because
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative eel is here no I
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
understand but all General it's all
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
getting B past is a public health issue
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's different I mean people are getting
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
sick from past so I think it's a a real
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
different issue than these disposable
 
00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
things right
 
00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:20.519 align:start position:0%
okay so um I'm I'm okay with interim
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
study to Simply you know because and
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
just for the public to understand uh the
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
way Commerce operates and uh under under
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
um my leadership this past uh session
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
which is that um I don't want to have a
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
bill go to the floor
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
1010 I I just don't think that that's a
 
00:30:43.509 --> 00:30:43.519 align:start position:0%
good uh precedent that um it it's a
 
00:30:45.549 --> 00:30:45.559 align:start position:0%
matter of who shows up that day whether
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
a bill becomes law you know goes forward
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
or not it just it's uh you know to me uh
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
whether the voters knew what they were
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
doing or not knowing what they're doing
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the fact that
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
we're 1010 means that that we only
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
really want to pass things that we we
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
have a strong majority in support of and
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
that that sending something to 1010 is
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
is maybe politically you know feel you
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
know that you know that okay let's have
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
the floor fight but I just don't I just
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
don't like doing that okay but just to
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that we will go to the floor
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
when we are cockus when we feel strongly
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
about it even if it is 101 I I hear that
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
you will hold out on that but I would be
 
00:31:29.629 --> 00:31:29.639 align:start position:0%
begging you not to do that and that
 
00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:31.519 align:start position:0%
let's let's just send these bills to
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
study and and and hope for the next
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
legislative session we're where you can
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
have a firmer uh majority one way or the
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
other we we don't want you to demean
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
Yourself by begging please well I do I I
 
00:31:46.029 --> 00:31:46.039 align:start position:0%
can beg I'm just saying let's not do
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
that I think the fact well I'm just
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
saying that that may not happen there
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's when we feel strongly
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
about something we're going to go to the
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
mat I don't think it's going to be often
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
right Mr chair but I think it may happen
 
00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
but then is a flawed bill that you're
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
sending to the floor at that time at
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
that point that's your opinion yeah
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
that's your opinion in my opinion yeah
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this 30 plus years I
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
think a bill that goes to the floor at
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
1010 is a flawed bill it's fundamentally
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
flawed because it doesn't have that
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
consensus that a committee's the whole
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of the committee is to find a
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
consensus to what makes a bill but some
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
bills are also politically motivated we
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
have to acknowledge that
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm trying I I I truly believe that
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
this committee should not be be move by
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
just pure policy oh I agree I agree
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
anyway we should and that's where that's
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming from this
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
commes well as a relative newcomer to
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
this operation I would like to and
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
therefore what I feel as an outsider I
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
believe you're both correct I believe
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
both sides will go to the floor and
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
we've seen I've certainly seen that in
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
my time here when you really believe
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing and I think that's
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
what you should do because the goal of
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
going to the floor is to sway votes on
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
the other side I also believe that
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
chairman Hunt is correct that really the
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
goal is to work the bills through
 
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
committee and come up with a consensus
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
and there are lit we could all come up
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
with a hundred answers of things that
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
are never going to come to a consensus
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that's where you just have to go
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
Slug It Out but for my part I'm happy to
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
send it to interim
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
study because that does give us that
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
we've seen bills in this last session
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
you know where you go wow it died before
 
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
so I agree I respect the position of the
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
Democrats to say we will go to the floor
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
the Republicans will certainly go to the
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
floor on those things that we disagree
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
with on and that is what still makes
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
America great yep and I want to say that
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
this I mean the reason I like serving on
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
this committee so much is that we agree
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
on a lot you you know I think we've
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
agreed on like up to 90 95% so you know
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
it's not like we're running up to to
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
challenge bills and I would say it's
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
because we're working it out in
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee yeah that's we're supposed to
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
do y so you know and I and I would
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
remind you we just the previous Bill we
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
just inter room studied it okay and
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
that's considered a partisan you know
 
00:34:20.399 --> 00:34:22.310 align:start position:0%
that's considered a partisan you know
Bill

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
right okay so
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
uh okay so now no right now I'm I'm
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
proposing interim study second and
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative grassy uh seconds my
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
motion of interim study on 1207 is there
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion all those
 
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
I okay was that it was it yes is that a
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
no that he has a no he's a no to the
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
motion of interim study so that would be
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right next up 12:32 prohibiting
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
the state or local governments from
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
using Central Bank digital
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
currency so where where are we with this
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
bill keyth
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
do I even have to raise my
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
hand I assume you were opposed to it you
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
would like to see it call legitimate
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why okay but let's let's hear
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
what Keith that's all right so we
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
already have a bill that's in an study
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
on this very topic um I know
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
representative and I representative
 
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
Spears and I uh disagree on whether or
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
not this is a potential threat to the
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
Liberties of people in our state I think
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
it is a uh
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
a serious threat potentially
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
now will it be implemented I I can't
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
tell you that so this may be a
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
prophylactic uh bill but I I appreciate
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
that Representatives bring these bills
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
forward so that we can at least have a
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
discussion about it get educated about
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
it and understand that a central bank
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
digital currency could potentially
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
eliminate private banking potentially if
 
00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's if it's a retail version yes the
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
banking Association is concerned about
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
that I've talked to them directly it
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
could also expose all of our
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
transactions to
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
government uh
 
00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
surveillance and it could
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
also allow the government to expire
 
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
money that we have prevent us from
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
purchasing certain things that aren't
 
00:36:44.359 --> 00:36:45.950 align:start position:0%
purchasing certain things that aren't
politically

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
politically
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
correct it's a it's a tool for
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
surveillance if it becomes implemented
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
here uh China's already working on it
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
we've looked at the Atlantic Council I
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
know representative Spears you and I
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
have both referenced that and that more
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
than several dozen countries are looking
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
into this um
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a concern that we should
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
continue to pay attention to but I don't
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
think we're ready to legislate that's
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
opinion I I agree with in part with what
 
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.470 align:start position:0%
opinion I I agree with in part with what
you're

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
saying but uh one of the problems I have
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
is that at the hearing some information
 
00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
was presented that was flat out
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
Incorrect and I have a problem with that
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and and as you say we have
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
had an inum A bill on inum study and
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
then by goodness I studied
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
it and I even wrote to the Federal
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
Reserve and I asked them what are you
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
looking at I mean in terms of what this
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
thing is going to do and one of the
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
things they say that they they do not
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
have the ability to deal with the public
 
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
they're not even allowed to based on the
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh Federal Reserve
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
Act so they they view it as being Bank
 
00:38:00.829 --> 00:38:00.839 align:start position:0%
as being Accounts at Banks where the
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
wallets are like actually kept in a bank
 
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
and the bank is the
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
intermediary and they gave a bunch of
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
rules of what people should be looking
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
at when they give their opinion on this
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the rules that they
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
have that they look at it the Federal
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
Reserve cannot deal with the public and
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
so they want Banks to act as
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
intermediaries so they're not there's
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
not a big rush to put Banks out of the
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
business but one of the things we have
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
to be aware of is that 88% of the entire
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
world's Reserve currency is the US
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
dollar and it is because we it is
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
because we are under a rule of law the
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
United States doesn't go willy-nilly and
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
cancel accounts or we going to lose the
 
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:51.400 align:start position:0%
biggest and best export that we have
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
which is the US dollar so the fear that
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to start putting
 
00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
timestamps on the money is one that I
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
would have to put in the back burner
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
just because China is doing it doesn't
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
mean we're going to do it they have also
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
said that
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
they're among the rules that they have
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
is privacy protected consumer privacy
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
intermediated the money must be
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
transferable uh it has to be able to
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
prevent Financial
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
crimes and it has to be identity
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
verified so that we don't end up funding
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
terrorism and all kinds of of other
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
things that are going on they've gotten
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
back 5,600 Pages as I've mentioned
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
before of uh of people's opinions and
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
organization opinions of what this
 
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
should look like they don't know what it
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
should look like they're evaluating
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
everybody's opinion so we don't know yet
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
what we're looking like so I think in
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
light of what you're saying uh
 
00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
representative Amman is that we're not
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
ready to legislate on this yet but I
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
will say and I have to say this at the
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
the meeting it at the hearing it was
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
presented that Texas had passed a law
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
outlawing Federal outlawing uh Central
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
Bank digital currency they did not what
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
some states are doing is passing
 
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
resolutions that they don't like it and
 
00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's what Texas did actually it never
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
even got out of that out of Texas it
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
never got signed there's about four
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
states that are doing that or attempting
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
to do that because the fact of the
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
matter is it is against the Constitution
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
like it or not it is unconstitutional
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
which means that it ever actually
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
happened you're in for a lawsuit and
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
you're in for a fight is that a fight we
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
really want when you consider that one
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
third of our income of the state's incom
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
comes from the federal government that's
 
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
not a fight we want they've also said in
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
their writings that it is
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
interchangeable with paper money and it
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
is interchangeable with any other kind
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
of currency electronic representation of
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
the dollar that we have it's an addition
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
to it isn't a substitution of it's
 
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
optional and that's one of that's the
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
rules that they have So based on that
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
unless we see something
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
different just back burner it again
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
another one or just we already have one
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
back bur it just cancel it already itl
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
it okay representating
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
Amon I I appreciate our sparring on this
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
issue and we're kind of coming to the
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
same conclusion which is fun but um one
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
area that I differ with you
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative Spears is I have a little
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
less trust for the federal government
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
having a our best interests in in mind
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
long term so um our job is to steer the
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
ship of state and in our federal system
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
the states have a say we don't have to
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
just defer to whatever the federal
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
government's going to do and some states
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
like Florida is definitely the first one
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh outlawed a central bank digital
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
currency it's become a national issue I
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've paid attention
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
recently but the front runner of the
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
Republican party just said he's never
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
going to allow it so maybe we have to
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm just making a joke um but
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
um I think uh this issue should be kept
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
on the on the burner and if we have two
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
bills that it's we're doubly paying
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
attention to it um now in this committee
 
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh last year we amended the uccc article
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
12 statute to exempt the definition of
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
money to take a potential Central Bank
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
digital currency applying to the
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
definition of money we modified that
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
bill so that you know we're not
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
explicitly allowing it we're we're going
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
to wait and see what it looks like but I
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
I agree with that but I am worried about
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
it I think that I think it is very
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
important to indicate that on that bill
 
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
and I have a copy of it if you'd like to
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
see it on the floridaa bill that
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
outlawed it it says in the physical note
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
that they understand it's
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and the damage to the
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
state is
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
undefinable they understand that that
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
what they're doing could be very bad for
 
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.150 align:start position:0%
what they're doing could be very bad for
the

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
state I the one that in Alabama which
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
also outlawed it which this this bill by
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
the way looks like a almost an exact
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
copy of the one from
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
Alabama and if we're going to say
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
something political we really shouldn't
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
be looking at Alabama as an example of a
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
good now
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
now hey look we started it we are being
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
respectful of every state okay but in
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
Alabama they said there would be no
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
impact and that's ridiculous of course
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
there is going to be an impact if
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:42.589 --> 00:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
so I think it's it based on that we have
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
to move very
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
carefully so uh over the years we've
 
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:49.640 align:start position:0%
always had the expression of not ready
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
for prime
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
time so I think most of these bills are
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time and then
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
interim study is always the right answer
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
here yes I'm so
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
sorry I I do so
 
00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
you and you have something important to
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
say on this matter so please turn on
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
your microphone the uh speak to the
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
microphone there
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
are it's not ready for prime time I
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
agree with that there you go but what I
 
00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
want to point out is that
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the larger context in the
 
00:44:29.839 --> 00:44:32.990 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the larger context in the
political

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
context the opposition
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
is primarily aimed at distrust
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
distrusting the uh federal government
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
and and the Federal Reserve and anything
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
in their uh in in that combination so as
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
a result the the uh the constant the
 
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
constant thing I hear is well I can do
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
this here in the state
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
and and there's a supremacy clause and
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
and it's they just say I don't really
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
care because I'm I'm here so New
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can do whatever it wants Texas
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
can do whatever it wants Florida can do
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
whatever it wants Alabama can do
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
whatever it wants and that really worked
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
with the Articles of the Confederation
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
which lasted 12
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
years so you need a good strong national
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
government and we need to trust it and
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
and if we want to go after it we have to
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
have a good reason now the reason
 
00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
I'm susp suspectful suspicious
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
suspicious is the fact that uh the
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
federal government doesn't really know
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
what to do with the idea of digital
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
currency they really don't they're stuck
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
and and uh well this say state or local
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
by the way well it's well the problem is
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's the federal government's
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
job it's congress's job in this Arena
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
and it's not our job to uh work work
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
with the currency you know or what could
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
be an alternate currency which is I
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
think in the going to we're going to
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
have to discuss it but the fact of the
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
matter is um one of the threats of uh
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
being a Libertarian in is that you don't
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
acknowledge uh that's that's kind of
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
refrain from going down that but it's
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's a common you will but let him
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
fin but it's an all it's an all
 
00:46:25.839 --> 00:46:26.870 align:start position:0%
fin but it's an all it's an all
inclusive

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
narrative that that is it's an ideology
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
it's a movement maybe but but it it
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
defies the uh Constitution and and every
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
time I hear it I realize I'm I'm being
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
asked to uh devalue uh the federal
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
government or defund it or and and the
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
and and the complaint is always the same
 
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
it basically boils down to it's my
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
business and you keep taking those out
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
of it and that goes right to the
 
00:46:59.710 --> 00:46:59.720 align:start position:0%
currency and this dollar the
 
00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
representative Spears is absolutely
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
correct it is the anchor of the world's
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
currency the central banks and to um
 
00:47:14.349 --> 00:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
move away from the dollar and and
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
somehow convince me that that's a good
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
idea from everything I've read that's a
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
very bad idea so um I'm just saying this
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
is the narrative you're going to hear
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and and uh you have to be
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
aware of the motivation respons so I you
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
know I I've read a lot
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
about I've read a lot about the politics
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
and and the and the ideologies of
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
various factions and they're all have
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
their own reasons for doing what they're
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
doing but the fact of the matter
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
is we went we went through this uh in
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
order to get a constitution and I don't
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
want to uh you know do it again and
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we're being asked to do too
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
many times just okay um representative
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
an i' like to respond first if you don't
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh you didn't say my name but I think I
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
was included in the uh the group that
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
you were talking about oh you're first
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
teamer all right um so I'd like to
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
respond uh first you mentioned the
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
supremacy clause and we hear people say
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
the supremacy Clause that doesn't mean
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
the federal government can do whatever
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
it wants the supremacy clause only
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
applies to the powers enumerated in the
 
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559 align:start position:0%
Constitution the 10th Amendment says all
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
other powers are delegated to the states
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a state so if you want
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
to be constitutionally literate when you
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
say the supremacy clause it should apply
 
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
to something that's actually in the
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution so respectfully the money
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
is money specifically is currency is
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
specifically Al enumerated in the
 
00:48:57.839 --> 00:48:59.430 align:start position:0%
specifically Al enumerated in the
Constitution

00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay so representative grassy I I think
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
one thing that people are overlooking
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
here and one comment was says you know
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
that this is going on in China China is
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
looking at this and there's a reason I
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
mean if you put 100 economists in room
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a 100 different
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
opinions but one thing that we're
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
looking at on the world stage right now
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
on the world market with the dollar
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
being the Supreme world currency is
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
China is looking at using this to
 
00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:23.559 align:start position:0%
supplant the dollar because this is how
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
you you are able to have intern Trade It
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
enhances international trade and if we
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
shut ourselves off from a central bank
 
00:49:32.789 --> 00:49:32.799 align:start position:0%
digital currency it's not for individual
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
indiv people basically China is looking
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
this as a way to Conor the market on
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
world trade and to supplant the dollar
 
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
as the reserve currency of the of the
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
world and you know we we just can't shut
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
it off so I I I would say iail this um
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
you know there there's this is a much
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
bigger thing than little New
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so what is the bill that we
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
have already what what's
 
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
the on this subject matter it would uh
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
ban any any uh currency that uh doesn't
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
respect privacy rights I think that's
 
00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:09.079 align:start position:0%
how it oh that's how it's written
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
protect was wasn't like El Salvador or
 
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.630 align:start position:0%
protect was wasn't like El Salvador or
something

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
or didn't they decide to go with the
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
currency or so that's that's El Salvador
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
made Bitcoin legal tender along with so
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
would that be but that's that's a that's
 
00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.109 align:start position:0%
would that be but that's that's a that's
like

00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
different it's related but different
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
right okay well I'll just throw a
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
curveball into everybody I think the uh
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
the bill establishing a state bullion
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
depository sort of sounds like digital
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
currency to me because you're not going
 
00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
to go around trading gold with people
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to be trading a digital
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
device so so no well I understand it's a
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
different bill but that's why I think
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
all these bills should be interim
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
studied okay uh can I ask a question
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
about that we already have one on
 
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
interim study how many do we need uh the
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
idea of interim study is because all of
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
them are in this Comm this subc
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
commmittee so that means when this
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meets with these issues
 
00:51:11.309 --> 00:51:11.319 align:start position:0%
they they can talk about any one of
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
these bills and they're free to it's a
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
makes it an open conversation about any
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
any and all subject matters would be
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
available to the subcommittee I I think
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
I have to to agree here with the
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
representative I think that you know I
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
mean you can have all of these bills but
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
this one here I think is different I
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
think you know having personal privacy
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
and currency is something that we should
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
we should look at this is dealing with
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
something that is far beyond the state
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and I think we should
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
stay you know this is this is just not
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
one that is anywhere near Prime
 
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.510 align:start position:0%
one that is anywhere near Prime
Time

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
Time
 
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
right well this kill it is again if it
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
if it comes down to 1010 we're going to
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
to to the floor and whether we're going
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
to kill it or interim study it like we
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
did I mean come on that's why waste
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
everybody's time on the house floor with
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
something like that let's just interim
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
study it and know that that this bill
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
probably will never have the deled day
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
but at least we can always talk about it
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
and have the committee has the vehicle
 
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:11.960 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
please try try me out on this is I I
 
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:16.760 align:start position:0%

00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:44.119 align:start position:0%

00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
whether I accept a motion or
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
not since always a chair has a right all
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
BRS yeah when I first heard the bill I
 
00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:17.559 align:start position:0%
thought well this this might be a good
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
idea until I got an email from one of my
 
00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
con constituents who has a bottle
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
distribution Bill 35 employees and um he
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
said that this bill could actually
 
00:58:32.829 --> 00:58:32.839 align:start position:0%
increase uh it would give main mass and
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
Vermont A2 $240 Kate advantage and it
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
would also have an an impact on this
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
business um New Hampshire would end up
 
00:58:42.029 --> 00:58:42.039 align:start position:0%
recycling bottles and cans from
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
neighboring states which I'm sure is
 
00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:46.599 align:start position:0%
true a bottle with uh Point uh 05 value
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
in Maine would be worth as much as5 in
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so they'd pay out as much
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
as5 for a deposit that they never
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
collected to begin with and um that
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me and um I'm certainly
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
not going to vote for a bill that's
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
going to hurt um a constituent's
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
business in that way great all right
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to speak for
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
it okay yeah Mr chairman yes represent
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's something that you
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
know at worst case I think this is
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
something we should look at I mean if
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to be uh just killing it I
 
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
think that's would be responsible I
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
think we should interim study this um
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
it's certainly something that I think
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
that um you know many particularly on my
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
side uh have a lot of support for uh you
 
00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
know this may not be the perfect bill
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
but uh to to just send it off into never
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
Neverland is uh probably not something
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
we should do I think we should take a
 
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
look at it maybe we can come out with a
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
come out with the perfect Bill next
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
time I say I think I think that's a good
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
idea just you know I hope that will
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
listen to people that it's going to
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
impact in the business Community
 
00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
certainly and I and I don't disagree
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
with that that we should listen to the
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
business Community but we also have to
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
take a look at the amount of waste that
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
we're putting into our
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
landfills okay so the sponsor would like
 
01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
on turn the mic on so we can all hear
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
you went home okay can everybody hear me
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
I won't yell but um so I was a little
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
surprised to see as many people here
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
today so I apologize for not having as
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
many uh handouts regarding um a
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
addressing the the objections but I just
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to say a couple things first of
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
all I think
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
whenever we present legislation that is
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a a large change I mean
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's really a systems change that we're
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we're we're never
 
01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
going to present a bill you know that's
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
going to be perfect um unless that
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
Bill's been worked on you know multiple
 
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
times beforehand so what I'm presenting
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
to you is what I think is a foundation I
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
mean I I think that the broad concepts
 
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill could work for New Hampshire
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
um but we need to be bringing
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together we need to be
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
bringing the industry together that was
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things I was hoping that we
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
could do before the bill was crafted uh
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
but the way the system works it just
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow you to to do that um you
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
know if they want to come in and talk
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
about it but but most of the time what
 
01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:29.799 align:start position:0%
industry wants to do is they want to see
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
the bill first and then they want to you
 
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
know kind of massage it or if they're
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
really against it and Industry is
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
against it in this case they just want
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
to have it dismissed but I think you
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
know I mean the the statistics prove
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again that every
 
01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
state that has a bottle Bill their
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
recycling rates are triple double to
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
Triple what our resp re recycling rates
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
are we have Recycling Industries that
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
are looking for recycled Goods that in
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
in higher quantities and in higher
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
qualities and um you know uh Redemption
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
programs will do that now you know I
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
mean when we're talking about recy
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
recycling goals you know I mean it's not
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
set in stone um you know I mean is is a
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
90% goal goal
 
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
achievable probably not maybe we should
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
be reducing that are the are the other
 
01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
goals you know the annual goals you know
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
but but let's get industry together with
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
us let's talk it out and let's see if we
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
can craft a better bill and I would be
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
more than happy you know to be if you do
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
interim study it I'd be more than happy
 
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
to be the Workhorse on that make the
 
01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
contact so we can get the right people
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
in the room and and we we hash it out
 
01:02:59.269 --> 01:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
and see what we can come to
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman yes um is this bill
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
modeled after any other State's bill I
 
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
mean it seems awfully long and I would
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
think it could be a much simpler Bill am
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
I incorrect yes you are incorrect okay
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
representative M mclair I have I mean
 
01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
I've looked at the michig the reason I
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
settled on this bill uh this model or
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
this template was because I could
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
understand it okay you have other bills
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
you know older bills uh you know uh
 
01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
Michigan was um 1978 you know and the
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
the way the money flows um is very
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
obtuse you know was hard to understand
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
it's very complicated in the most uh
 
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
most of the times they put the
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
government in charge a government agency
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's not the New Hampshire way so but
 
01:03:59.510 --> 01:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
but to your point these bills are
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
complicated they have a lot of different
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
facets to it and that's why we really
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
need to be developing a partnership um
 
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
and and it doesn't need to be as
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
expansive we we need to start someplace
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
oh oh the other thing I wanted to
 
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
mention and forgot about this uh it
 
01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
should the uh Liquor Commission should
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
be Exempted at this point I never meant
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
to have The Liquor Commission included
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
uh but when we were talking about this I
 
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
frankly was thinking more in the line of
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
grocery stores but under the bill the
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
way it's written Now The Liquor
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
Commission would be included although I
 
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
think at some point they would be
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
perfect you know for some kind of
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
redemption system that's down the road
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
um we don't we don't want to complicate
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
things so so that's uh one of the things
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
I wanted you to think
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
about now how does that make any sense
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
tell everybody in the state that you
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
know all the merchants they got to do it
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
and that the state is off the hook I'm
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
saying uh I'm saying they're off the
 
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
hook as a redemption
 
01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
center for the moment but think of how
 
01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
many bottles they're pushing out the
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
door representative hunt if you want to
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
include them and and have that part of
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
the study I'm I'm fine with it I'm
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
complete opposite I think that's a
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
classic example why this bill should not
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
ever be passed
 
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
why we should never have a bottle pill
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and because we too have
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
some skin in the game and know that we
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
don't want you know this is this is a
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
huge burden on the system we have a
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
great system now of getting you know
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
getting the trash picked up the side of
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
the roads which is the fundamental need
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of recycling I mean yeah I'm
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
you can't get anybody who's more wants
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
to recycle than me you I mean
 
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
I go into it but I think aluminum should
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
always be recycled everybody should be
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
saving their recy aluminum I think
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea but but but at this
 
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
time it's it's like it's it's an age
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
gone by it's a recycling rate is
 
01:06:09.870 --> 01:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
23% okay and and the only state in New
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
England that's lower than that is Rhode
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
Island it's 19% and they don't have a
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
bottle Bill Maine is
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
65% I think Massachusetts is 40 I think
 
01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:21.799 align:start position:0%
Vermont is
 
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
44 okay um and yeah so so I mean I I
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
think it's nice but unless we put
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place that make it
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
convenient and convenient for them and
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
also everybody goes to the grocery store
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
every week people in the North Country
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
go go to the transfer station we will
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
make it convenient for them to do it no
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
but it's not convenient I mean I mean if
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
convenience was true then they wouldn't
 
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
have to have signs there don't forget to
 
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
bring in your your shopping bags okay we
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
all forget to bring our shopping bags
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
all right well not all if I can't
 
01:07:01.710 --> 01:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
remember to bring my shopping bag why am
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
I going to remember to bring my my my
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
recyclables well right now the
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
recyclables you know I I right now take
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
my recyclable you know when I go to the
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know get to the dump you know so
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's my point and your dump can have a
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
recycle center there and so instead of
 
01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
putting them in the bin to recycle you
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
put it in want pay 30 cents on my
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
six-pack or 60 cents I know you're going
 
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
and you're going to allow somebody to
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
make interest on that 60 cents for a
 
01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:38.119 align:start position:0%
week no I
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
no oh listen I can't convert you and I
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
in this system in this system you have
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
the option you have the option to
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
recycle you have the option to throw it
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
in your trash and have it go in the
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
landfill that's your choice okay so
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
we're not forcing you to do anything no
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
you're forcing me to pay more at the
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
time I'm buying it represent am thank
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um just thinking about this
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
issue so in in New Boston the town I
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
live in we have a recycling very fine
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
grained recycling in our town dump so we
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
have to separate the plastic by the
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
Numbers uh and uh the enforcement is
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
very strict if you uh get my drift we
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
have a dumpster n Nazi too I I was
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
he rips the bags open right there in
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
front of you when D hi Jerry um so my
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
question is we our town funds our um our
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
transfer station based on recycling fees
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
and if the state had had a uh you know a
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
Statewide program would that make it
 
01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
harder for us to fund our transfer
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
station uh no because in this bill um
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
there there is a way to um what's the
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
pay back transfer stations okay so so if
 
01:08:59.550 --> 01:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
you look at one of the things that I
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
tried very hard to look at is um making
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
sure that that everybody got a little
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
bit now you know I mean there might be
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
some towns where they the recycling
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
rates are really high for like aluminum
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
okay and they might um you know so they
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
might lose Revenue there but I can tell
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
you every transfer station that I've
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
talked to one of the big issues is glass
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay because glass is heavy so per
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
tonnage you're paying a lot for it uh so
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
anything that they might make on say
 
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
aluminum you know they're going to be
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
losing on cardboard and plastic and and
 
01:09:39.269 --> 01:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
and glass um they can also become a
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
Redemption Center okay so and and in
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
this bill uh if you choose to become a
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
redemption center it's an organization
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh the industry pays for it so so right
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
now we're all paying for this stuff to
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
be carded away whether you know and and
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know any Town that's making
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
money on their landfills or on their on
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
their transfer stations I mean
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
everybody's paying for it so you know so
 
01:10:09.149 --> 01:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
in in this case you would have set up a
 
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
producer respons uh a PR producer
 
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.830 align:start position:0%
producer respons uh a PR producer
responsibility

01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
organization and it's their
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to purchase install and
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
maintain reverse vending machines you
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
know in these location
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
and they also um reimburse the let's say
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
if it's a retail store or if it's um a
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
transfer station they also get
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for the footage that is being
 
01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
taken up by the reverse vending machine
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
area and the as the pro gets more
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
efficient okay I mean you're always
 
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
going to have people who choose to throw
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
their you know bottles and cans out the
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
window okay and the 60 cents doesn't
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
mean as much as them to them as it means
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
to other people so you know so that
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
money will go back into the system okay
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
and and it defrays all of these costs
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's really important
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
is that the bill there's oversight on
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
the part of Dees but all of their costs
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
are paid um through the producer
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility organization so again
 
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
there's there's no cost to the taxpayers
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
where right now you know there's a huge
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
T cost to the taxpayers um because you
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
have Industries who are producing trash
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know I mean they they create a
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
product it becomes trash and we pick up
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
the bill for it and you know Industries
 
01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
are beginning to understand this is not
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
new technology I mean they've been doing
 
01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
this for years in uh Europe okay I mean
 
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
we have 10 states that are doing it now
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
um You Know It it's in my old home state
 
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
of Michigan and it's been in effect
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
since 1978 my you know my the people my
 
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
family back there it just becomes part
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
of your it becomes part of your routine
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
just like recycling is now no different
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
great thank you yeah represent
 
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
taxon so I need to put on my selectman's
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
hat this bill is a nightmare for a small
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
town and I don't want to burn up the
 
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
next 25 minutes on explain to everybody
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
in the room why and then arguing the
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
case I think we have the sponsor of the
 
01:12:31.629 --> 01:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
bill has said she recognizes the bill is
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
flawed and I think the most appropriate
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
thing to do with the bill while I would
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
like to say itl it is send it to interim
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
study that's how that representative
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
taxon moves interim study right second
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
and we have a second by representative
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
grassy any discussion on the motion of
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
interim study see none all those in
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
favor please say I I those
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
supposed represent Herbert I didn't hear
 
01:12:57.679 --> 01:13:02.550 align:start position:0%
supposed represent Herbert I didn't hear
from

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
Z all
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.590 align:start position:0%
 
fast

we're seeking damages um I'm also going
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
to provide to the committee when we're
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%

01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
contamination in New Hampshire it's very
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
widespread this was issued in December
 
01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.310 align:start position:0%
widespread this was issued in December
of

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
2023 and I offer this um as further
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
evidence of why it's a smart move for
 
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to start to turn off the
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
tap another thing I would I want to uh
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
share with you is and it should be in
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
the materials provided by representative
 
01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
spear the national waste and recycling
 
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
Association has written um in support of
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
this bill it uh and as they say here the
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chapter members operate in
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
every community and employ more than
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
2500 residents and they generate $150
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
million in state Pro uh payroll and
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility for $400 million in
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue um the support uh
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
includes um waste management cassella
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
and several other recycling um and waste
 
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
management organizations and I was able
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
to get um the members from New Hampshire
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
from the um NW and I'd be happy to
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
provide that to the
 
01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.629 align:start position:0%
provide that to the
committee

01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
um so the other thing and we'll discuss
 
01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:23.560 align:start position:0%
this in Greater detail
 
01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to make sure that the
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
committee uh checks out State actions on
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
P because the last time we were here we
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
discussed the across theboard past bands
 
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
that were in Maine and Minnesota what I
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
didn't know at the time honestly is that
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
there were many many other targeted
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
bands in the in the United States and
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
that we would not be going it alone
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
based on the items that I've selected uh
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
and identified for product bands and we
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
can talk about this um in more
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
detail um so I have some other things
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
here but we can go ahead and and dive
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
into the um and dive into the bill so I
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
papers um the first thing Mr shair and I
 
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
think you can have perhaps a deeper
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
conversation about um this issue with um
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
director whimet pursuant to your uh
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
request we did seek further information
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
on the issue of the Clearing House for
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
purposes of
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
notification um the
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
notification provision in the bill
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
starts on page four line
 
01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.390 align:start position:0%
starts on page four line
24

01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
um and as I say i' I'd like to ask uh
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
the director to speak in more detail
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
about this but basically what what I
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to do is get on paper a letter
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
for the committee to look at that
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
described exactly what numo was thinking
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
about with respect to a clearing house
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
for reporting purposes and if we were to
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
participate in a CL in a Clearing House
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
it would be the
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
ic2 the numbers for creation of the
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
clearing house and for membership are
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
much less than what um the department
 
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.229 align:start position:0%
much less than what um the department
originally

01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
originally
 
01:19:37.470 --> 01:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
thought however they're still um not
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
insubstantial so uh you can we can talk
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
in Greater detail about that but Mr
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
chair especially I I wanted to get this
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
for you all right down there on paper so
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a telephone tag or or whatever
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
I wanted you to see it
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
yourself um and the rest of the
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
committee so going to the notification
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
provision um which as I say starts on
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
page four line so my understand you
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
don't have an amendment for me for us
 
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
today I don't have uh no I didn't bring
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
in because I thought that we would be
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
discussing this and I'd be happy to
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment for you based on I
 
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:20.440 align:start position:0%
mean I have I have a very clear idea of
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
of what an amendment would look at but I
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
thought it would be helpful for the
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee because it's not going to be a
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
lot of tweaking it's going to be a
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
decision there's a lot seven pages in
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
this current bill right and go for us to
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
go through this now it's not going to
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
take that long I swear to you okay so
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
the first thing I guess I but I also
 
01:20:45.149 --> 01:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
want the department see I was looking
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
for the Department to be creating this
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
if if you would just bear with me for a
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
little bit Mr Mr chair here okay all
 
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
right I am here to discuss with you the
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
notification provision because I have
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
learned that
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
um aside from
 
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
Maine and there is really no other state
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
that has a notification provision like
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
this in their targeted band okay so
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
where is that in this bill that is on
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
page four line
 
01:21:19.199 --> 01:21:20.870 align:start position:0%
page four line
24

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
you know again I defer to the committee
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
but if it makes a difference to the
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
committee from an expense
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
standpoint um and from a burden to the
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
agency if we want to align with other
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
states that have targeted banss we could
 
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
completely remove the notification
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
requirement and that so this is all
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral four that is Roman numeral
 
01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.390 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral four that is Roman numeral
4

01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
4
 
01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:55.719 align:start position:0%
through um page five line 11 so that's r
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
a numeral four yes okay okay so then
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
moving on to page five uh line
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
12 this is uh section five this is the
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
labeling requirement so if you go
 
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
through the industry
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
documentation um you will see that one
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
of their biggest objections to this bill
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
is the labeling requirement and that is
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
because this bill is a targeted ban of
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
very I of of a certain number of
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
consumer products if we do an across
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
theboard B uh across theboard labeling
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
requirement folks like the automobile
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
industry um the medical folks all sorts
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
of folks will have to uh engage in quite
 
01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:50.719 align:start position:0%
a bit of labeling I believe that
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
labeling is really helpful
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
however I can also understand why it
 
01:22:59.070 --> 01:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
creates huge uh complications for the
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
industry and I think that if we move
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
ahead with a ban um we could discuss
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
labeling in the future so if we remove
 
01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:11.560 align:start position:0%
the labeling portion that would be Roman
 
01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
numeral five which goes all the way to
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
page six line
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
11 now OS very helpfully
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
also named prohibitions Roman numeral 5
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I see that looks like they right
 
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
screwed up so uh this is another Roman
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
numeral right so on the um on the
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
subject of the product bands I would
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
refer to you again this state uh action
 
01:23:48.629 --> 01:23:48.639 align:start position:0%
on past this is really helpful because
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
it identifies the products being banned
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
and the years when the bands are
 
01:23:58.669 --> 01:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
effective so if you go through my list
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
there is virtually nothing on this list
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
that is not also on this um on the list
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
of targeted bands that have already been
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
um have already are are in the process
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
of taking
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
place um I would call out feminine
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
hygiene products in many cases they
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
include those in um personal care
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
products so um even though you see them
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
called out maybe separately on here it's
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
actually many more states have this um
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
dental floss and this is going to relate
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
to another uh discussion we're going to
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
have in a minute um dental floss believe
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
it or not is a medical device approved
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
FDA and I'm going to propose that we
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
exclude products that are approved by
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
the FDA as medical devices and drugs um
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill so that would mean that we'd remove
 
01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.350 align:start position:0%
bill so that would mean that we'd remove
dental

01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
dental
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
floss the the item that's also affected
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
by an exclusion of FDA approved medical
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh devices is personal protective
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
equipment and I've been in communication
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
with uh several Industries representing
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
the medical folks and um they provided
 
01:25:26.669 --> 01:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
me with uh language which I do have um
 
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
that I could provide to the committee
 
01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
and that exclusion language would come
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
in later in the bill so the only other
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to say about this um to
 
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
is I have upholstered furniture here as
 
01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:44.750 align:start position:0%
is I have upholstered furniture here as
number

01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
10 there are several states that are
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
excluding textiles as a whole not
 
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.390 align:start position:0%
excluding textiles as a whole not
including

01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
apparel we could
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
consider um removing dental floss and we
 
01:26:01.109 --> 01:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
can also consider Florine treated
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
containers if you want to because that's
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
not a targeted band that would be in
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
effect before ours and it might be worth
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
considering replacing that with uh
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
textile articles because it has a huge
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
past load and it's a great concern to
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
the um to the waste management people
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
and I could provide language in that
 
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
regard so that's sort of what I have to
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
say about the product
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
ban I I think it's difficult to talk
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
about the product ban without um
 
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
referring the committee um and I'm sorry
 
01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going backwards in the bill to the
 
01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:44.189 align:start position:0%
I'm going backwards in the bill to the
definition

01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
section um for
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
p which is
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
S so one of the most highly discussed
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
topics in all of this is the definition
 
01:27:05.639 --> 01:27:06.709 align:start position:0%
topics in all of this is the definition
of

01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
pasas um we already have a definition of
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
pasas in the books um on behalf of
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
firefighters and firefighting foam and
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at that if you go on line
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
eight I would propose we conform our um
 
01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
Bill to the statutes that we already
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
have in place and I would propose
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
removing or methylene carbon atom and
 
01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:35.639 align:start position:0%
just conclude it with fully fluorinated
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
carbon I've discussed this with the
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
state toxology uh Jonathan patali the
 
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
most patient person on Earth and um this
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
actually makes the definition somewhat
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
narrower than the definition that I have
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
here and that definition will conform
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
with the definition that's used in all
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
these targeted bands and it will conform
 
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
with uh what we already have on our
 
01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.990 align:start position:0%
with uh what we already have on our
state

01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
statutes now I have to say here that the
 
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
industry and you span and the American
 
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
chemistry Council we've had really
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
really good conversations and we've
 
01:28:16.719 --> 01:28:18.149 align:start position:0%
really good conversations and we've
discussed

01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
it they would like to narrow the
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
definition more more and the specific
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
concern is hfos which are refrigerants
 
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
and can be used for
 
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
propellant there is not a product that I
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
am targeting for a ban that includes
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
those items and I honestly don't see the
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
reason now for excluding hfos from our
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
definition I just and and if you want to
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
think about implementation of these
 
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
targeted bands ease for the agency um
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
also for
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturers um you know I just and
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
also just alignment with our own laws I
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
don't see the point in going to a more
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
complex um definition and you know if
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
you want to talk to the state toxology I
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
mean we've talked about this the concern
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
is really the issue of
 
01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.870 align:start position:0%
is really the issue of
hfos

01:29:18.870 --> 01:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
hfos
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
um the simplest solution there is just
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
that after you have this definition you
 
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
then go on and say that at no time does
 
01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
this include and then create that Lit
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
spot where you would say hfos you know I
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
mean we could do that or we that way
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
that way they would have warm fuzzies
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
that that the only way they would be
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
included is that we would have to repeal
 
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
that out of our statute well or we just
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
don't I mean Mr chair you and I will
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
disagree on that I just honestly don't
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
see the point at this point for
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
excluding them because I'm not targeting
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
anything that they're involved in and
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
clearly if if a product was going to be
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
added that included hfos it would take
 
01:30:07.629 --> 01:30:07.639 align:start position:0%
legislation and it just wouldn't happen
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
without this uh legislator's um support
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
so you know chicken in the egg you know
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
one of the other yeah I mean it really
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
is and as I said before nobody else is
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
doing that literally nobody else is that
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
that I see here is doing
 
01:30:30.669 --> 01:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
that okay okay so um so how does this
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
this law enforced how is this law
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
enforced well I'm going to ask my um the
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
the department person to come up here
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
and speak I I will say that
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
understanding uh more completely that
 
01:30:49.149 --> 01:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
there's not a notification provision and
 
01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
that all these states are really relying
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
on certific of compliance we've had to
 
01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
think a little more you know we have to
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
think a little bit more about that but
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's a mechanism that's that's being
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
used um by other by other states and the
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
only other thing Mr chair I'm sorry that
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
I didn't mention this before um I gave
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of sheets there with a
 
01:31:17.109 --> 01:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
with a press release the EPA um as
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
of uh May
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
2025 has put into place uh under TSA and
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't know the acronym um a
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement for all uh P using
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
their definition and their definition
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
does exclude um hfos as I understand it
 
01:31:40.950 --> 01:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
but it's a pretty um complex definition
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not sure that's something
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
that we would want to include um however
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's a reporting system that will be up
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
and running before our ban would
 
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
place uh good morning morning uh Mr
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee for the
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mike winsat I serve as
 
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
director of the waste management
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
division for the New Hampshire
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services uh
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
in answer to your question Mr chair
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
regarding uh how it would be enforced as
 
01:32:18.109 --> 01:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
currently drafted this bill does provide
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh for one position appropriates funds
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
for a position at the department
 
01:32:25.149 --> 01:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that um if if as
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative eelis testified and
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
suggested that the reporting or
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
notification requirements were removed
 
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
um um we believe that actually that
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
position would be in a better position
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
to do compliance monitoring and
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement I think the fact that as
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
we've learned you know relatively
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
recently about the more broader group of
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
states that have already got laws on the
 
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
books to implement targeted banss um I
 
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
think that the that that job gets easier
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
because the more states that have done
 
01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
this the more likely it is that uh the
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers will find a way to
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
manufacture products that that are
 
01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:01.719 align:start position:0%
subject to the band that don't have
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
pasas uh but we believe that you know
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
consistent with the way we've looked at
 
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
other bands um a position that's in in
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
the law right now or that's appropriated
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh in this bill uh would uh would be in
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
a position to monitor do compliance
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
monitoring of specific products and take
 
01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
action when uh when compliance problems
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
are identified
 
01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:25.880 align:start position:0%
so humor me uh that means just
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
compliance person is going to go around
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
and grab a something off the shelf and
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
test it or go see whether it's on the
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
list on the of of through the Clearing
 
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
House it's it's possible that that that
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
is a way to do it I mean we in the in
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
our taxic toxics and packaging uh work
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
we have actually gone and when we've
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
become aware that there's a particular
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
product that may be suspect we've
 
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
actually purchased one and taken a
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
sample and and done a few small
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions with regard to that
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
and it's been effective uh but also
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
because other states are involved and
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
because we would likely um to the extent
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
that there were services or information
 
01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
being provided by a Clearing House such
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
as ic2 we would likely be coordinating
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
and communicating with our colleagues in
 
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
the other states and then that of course
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
just m means makes everybody's costs and
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
and and and burden much lighter well I
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
guess yeah I'm interested in how do you
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
do a seasoned assist I mean that's not
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
normally a task you guys do too often ex
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
well so the inate stuff yeah as the bill
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
is crafted it does give us enforcement
 
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
Authority and um we do have uh in our um
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
in our laws the ability to enforce
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
through administrative orders and civil
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
um and criminal sanctions depending on
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
so how do you stop I mean do you have
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
John Hunt's rule of lure that I mean a
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
business is making a product we don't
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
license them right you don't license
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
anybody so how are you going to cease
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
and assist how are you going to shut
 
01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.189 align:start position:0%
and assist how are you going to shut
them

01:34:50.189 --> 01:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
down it in the case of tux and packaging
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
we have uh reached out through the
 
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to that
 
01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or to that to that seller
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
and then um basically it said you need
 
01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
to fix this and if they don't fix it so
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
this would be a responsibility of the
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to then
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
enforce the order in the final analysis
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%
it could be that way it's possible if if
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature saw fit to give
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
administrative finding authority to the
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
department it's something the department
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
could do without the assistance of the
 
01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
AG but but you can't really if you don't
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
have them licensed right how do you who
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
do you find when you no we we we have
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
administrative F we not not that I'm
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
testifying saying that's how it should
 
01:35:31.629 --> 01:35:31.639 align:start position:0%
go but if it were to go that way I just
 
01:35:33.629 --> 01:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
want to help help me out understanding
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
that we we do have administrative fine
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
Authority for a number of our regulatory
 
01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
programs and there are many for example
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
in our hazardous waste program we don't
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
license hazardous waste generators there
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
are hundreds of Manufacturers that
 
01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
generate hazardous waste we don't issue
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
licenses to them or or permits necessar
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
neily but they are all subject to
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
specific requirements that are in our
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
rules and when those rules are violated
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
we we have a long history of of of
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
issuing administrative penalties
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
administrative fines to those with
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
respect to they don't pay the fine uh
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
then the AG's office would have uh the
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
authority to to uh to enforce civil okay
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
so that statute did we use that from the
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
Mercury statute the uh how do you how do
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
you enforce that how did you enforce the
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
Mercury thing to be honest I don't know
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
if we ever needed to take an enforcement
 
01:36:26.189 --> 01:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
action through the um the Mercury
 
01:36:27.629 --> 01:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
program that's not me saying it didn't
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
happen I honestly don't know whether we
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
did but I'm not aware of
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
any okay because so so we're going to
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
create a position that's going to cost
 
01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
us 100 30,000 forever and
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
ever well nothing's forever but but
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
unless we Sunset it or repeal it right
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
well so yeah if there if a position is
 
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
created that that was targeted at doing
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
that then that's what we would do
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
obviously if we get to a point years out
 
01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
where the bands are fully implemented it
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
might well be that a part-time position
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
or even no position at all create
 
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
position for
 
01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.870 align:start position:0%
position for
mercury

01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
mercury
 
01:37:10.830 --> 01:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
um I we may have at the time I I wasn't
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
I wasn't involved in the program at that
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
time but I there no position there was
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
no specific position to Mercury at this
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
present because it's a it's a light load
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
because it's been in place and it's been
 
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
effective okay so what we're hearing is
 
01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
um we need to maybe look at that
 
01:37:31.750 --> 01:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
definition of past take out the meth
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
methylene carbon atom and I'm suggesting
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
that we add in a room of an exemption
 
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
list to say these things it does not
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
include that way it gives those people
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
warm fuzzy so they don't use that excuse
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
to why we should be opposed to the bill
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
if we specifically wrote in them to who
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
they would be out I know you don't agree
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
with me but that's just how um I I it's
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
this committee sees a lot of bills like
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
this and we and the it's always the
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
exemption list when the exemption list
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
gets longer than the actual statute then
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
we know we've got a problem with the
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
bill itself but I'm assuming that there
 
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
aren't too many entities that want to
 
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
make sure they're exempt from
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
this um so there's the medical group and
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
then there's the um then there's the
 
01:38:17.679 --> 01:38:19.430 align:start position:0%
then there's the um then there's the
pesticide

01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
pesticide
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so I so for the exclusion
 
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
language um that would be in the
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
exclusion section of the bill um I would
 
01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:33.159 align:start position:0%
I'm I have language to exclude the FDA
 
01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
uh approved items and fifra which
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
where's the exclusion list where's that
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.229 --> 01:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
um well it's not Roman numeral
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
5 yeah actually I wrote h under
 
01:38:51.589 --> 01:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
five but it probably is a whole new it
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
six um it's the section that says if if
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's something uh subject to
 
01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
regulation by the federal government
 
01:39:05.190 --> 01:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
then it's exempt oh
 
01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:08.950 align:start position:0%
then it's exempt oh
[Music]

01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh wait I feel like I'm closing in
 
01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.109 --> 01:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
two you can I mean if you want to just
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
tell I I believe the section you're
 
01:39:27.430 --> 01:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
looking for is uh Roman 2 page uh I'm
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
sorry page three line 36 it would makes
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
sense it would be two yes okay sorry
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
about that CR from this section okay so
 
01:39:39.030 --> 01:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there we need to have yep
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I and the other uh group that I'm
 
01:39:44.109 --> 01:39:44.119 align:start position:0%
proposing to exclude uh the utilities
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
you'll recall were
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
concerned um about uh being considered
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
Manu ufacturers are incidentally adding
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
things when all they're doing is just
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
processing uh our waste waterer and our
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
so I have language um okay so that's
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
what we'll need for the next meeting is
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
we need that exemption exemption list
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
okay so public
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
utilities and what do we call these H
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
what do we call the well we'll have to
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
talk about that I I have to say Mr chair
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to strenuously um object
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the object to the inclusion of that
 
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm just telling you right well let
 
01:40:30.510 --> 01:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
me put it this way if you have all these
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
other people exempt you know like what
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
makes them so special versus this one
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
product because it's FDA approved it's
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's pesticide approval and it's a and
 
01:40:43.149 --> 01:40:43.159 align:start position:0%
it's a utility and again there's no
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
product that I'm proposing to ban that
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
includes hfos so I just don't see the
 
01:40:52.109 --> 01:40:52.119 align:start position:0%
point uh it's um what was like belts and
 
01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
suspenders is what I've heard that
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
expression used before all right
 
01:41:01.510 --> 01:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
well I remember Ed Ed Butler using it
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so I guess if we just want to go
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
through this Mr chair um if I'm going to
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment yeah
 
01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.589 align:start position:0%
prepare an amendment yeah
um

01:41:11.589 --> 01:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
I'll I I'll propose to remove the
 
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.709 align:start position:0%
I'll I I'll propose to remove the
notification

01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
notification
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
provision exactly and that's a good
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
chunk yeah that's a good chunk yeah I
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
like that's great and and by the way uh
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh California actually vetoed a
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
reporting bill um because of the EPA
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
so I think we're you know anyway I just
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
thought I forgot that's a good direction
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
to go then is that what you're saying
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
well I thought you'd like that well in
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
norn California I I just want to know
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
what products actually been banned I
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
just like since it's been on the books I
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
guess California just been on the books
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
right it just got well yeah but so I
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
want to know what's actually what came
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
out of it I I want to know something
 
01:41:57.870 --> 01:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
that actually got fix this doesn't tell
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
you what actually got fixed okay so
 
01:42:02.109 --> 01:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
California passed it well it depends on
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
when the effective dat I can food
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
packaging that's the one I care about
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
the most well and you can see the most
 
01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
uh folks are that's what they banned
 
01:42:13.589 --> 01:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm going to get rid of the
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
labeling requirement yes do you have any
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh stomach for moving up the band date
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
to 2027
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
question uh I if that was their
 
01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation then that's one I want to
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
stick with all right well they they
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
didn't these were sort of my dates no I
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
thought that was a a very reasonable
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
compromise offer gives the legislature
 
01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to decide to so you like
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
2028 2028 is wonderful okay
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
um okay you only wish I would I'm I'm
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
removing d
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
floss okay yes got rid of that and then
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
I would like I mean how about this
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
Florin treat get rid of fluorinated
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
treated containers and add in the
 
01:43:05.229 --> 01:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
textile articles because the the waste
 
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
people if you I mean I've given you a
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
lot of materials one of those charts say
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest what's the difference
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
between textiles and fabrics um well I
 
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
would go back to the definitions that
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
were used but
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
um a it's a broad category that includes
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things but apparel is
 
01:43:28.589 --> 01:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
excluded So Pro probably Matts I don't
 
01:43:31.470 --> 01:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
know Mr chair I got to look at that but
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
I swear to you I will figure it out by
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
the time I have the amendment for you
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
okay um and yeah I mean I think I think
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
that's basically it and you know I I
 
01:43:47.629 --> 01:43:47.639 align:start position:0%
would just say that I know there's
 
01:43:50.430 --> 01:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
concern about employees but you know
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is really an incredibly important
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
issue that we're facing in the state we
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
need to turn off the tap and you can't
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
make it happen if you don't have a
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
person to to work on it I mean honestly
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
I think what happened in Maine one of
 
01:44:08.669 --> 01:44:08.679 align:start position:0%
the reasons they got in trouble is that
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
they only um you know they went as big
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
as they could go and they financed two
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
employees and it's just overwhelmed them
 
01:44:20.910 --> 01:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
okay humor me and just put a sunset for
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
5 years say that again Sunset five years
 
01:44:27.589 --> 01:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
no the bills effective 2028 let's have
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
that position Sunset after a certain
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
point five years and that point then
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
there going to be the discussion whether
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a NE necessary need to keep
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
it going forward are you say are you
 
01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
saying the dees position the person oh
 
01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
you have the statue still on the book
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not changing that but given the fact
 
01:44:47.109 --> 01:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
that we don't actually have an employee
 
01:44:47.119 --> 01:44:48.750 align:start position:0%
that we don't actually have an employee
for

01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
mercury well I mean there's another way
 
01:44:54.189 --> 01:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
to approach it I suppose and just say
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
that the the have the department come
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
back and report on the necessity of the
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
employee before we Sunset it I mean it's
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
also a discussion that we can have at
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
the finance level as far as money is
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
concerned I just asking to put the
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
sunset in for five years so that I can
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
say to the to finance that I'm
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
comfortable with spending a half a
 
01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the next five year
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know the five years beginning 2028
 
01:45:22.990 --> 01:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
on this to enfor you know to make sure
 
01:45:25.229 --> 01:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
this is enforced and after that point
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
they can so there's an employee and
 
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
there's a another appropriation yeah
 
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I see so you're talking about the
 
01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
employee the two the 250 is a One-Shot
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
deal just to get things up and
 
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
running that was I'm looking down at the
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
methodology yeah and then and then I
 
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
assume because I've had bills before
 
01:45:49.229 --> 01:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
where it has creates positions and I
 
01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
just don't want to be accused of
 
01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
creating a position that'll last forever
 
01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:54.639 align:start position:0%
and ever I wouldn't want you accused of
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
chair um okay so I'll initiate the
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
process with with OS and I'll be sure
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
that you see what I've got but could you
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
just tell me how you'd like me exactly
 
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
to proceed from here date wise and all
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
that uh we're we'll be doing this again
 
01:46:16.229 --> 01:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday okay so you would plan on
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
executing it in a week I believe I have
 
01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
this is an early bill so we have to
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
execute the following week yeah so again
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's why we're doing getting the
 
01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
groundwork set today okay now when said
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
are you all set with this is this this
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
work for you before I take yeah so as
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
you recall the department did not take a
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
position on this bill we did express
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
some concerns in the first hearing um
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a lot of changes and
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
proposals have been talked about today
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
that will presumably go into and a
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
proposed Amendment and so I'll be
 
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
coordinating with our leadership to
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
figure out where we're going to be on it
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
but I think this this I would observe
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
that this addresses a lot of the
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had about
 
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
implementation of this okay so it's it's
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
going in the right direction but you
 
01:47:05.709 --> 01:47:05.719 align:start position:0%
haven't got their blessing but as far as
 
01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
you know this we've we've we've turned
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
over enough rocks I think that's a fair
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
statement yes yeah I just have a
 
01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
question for you Mr W um budget time
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
when it comes budget time will you be
 
01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
including this position in your budget
 
01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
yes if this bill were to pass then
 
01:47:27.629 --> 01:47:27.639 align:start position:0%
presumably it would be signed into law
 
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
um in the in the in the summer and
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's when we start working on our next
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
Bal budget so we would uh certainly uh
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
you know with armed with that knowledge
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
we would work that into our budget
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
proposal thank
 
01:47:42.189 --> 01:47:42.199 align:start position:0%
you okay yes I just want to make sure
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
we're aligned in this and and as long as
 
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
the Director is sitting here if I'm
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
preparing this with OS when would be the
 
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to see for the hiring of
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
the employee so that I don't put a sun
 
01:48:00.189 --> 01:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
just thinking in here that is wobber jaw
 
01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
speak so if I understand your question
 
01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
the the bill is it's currently crafted
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
establishes a position in the department
 
01:48:12.669 --> 01:48:12.679 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
um appropriates the salary and benefits
 
01:48:18.109 --> 01:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
and other costs associated with that for
 
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
the bium ending 202 five which is our
 
01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
current bium um so ideally we would want
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
to see I mean in order to get a good
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
running start and get
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
the all the necessary infrastructure in
 
01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
place to administer this it would be
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
helpful if this position were effective
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
um I I mean realistically in terms
 
01:48:45.310 --> 01:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
of if it were created and it were
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
effective uh say January 1 of
 
01:48:51.550 --> 01:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
25 that would you you know if it were
 
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:53.800 align:start position:0%
signed in the summer of 24 then that
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
would give us time to get all the
 
01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel work done through the
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
department of personnel get the position
 
01:49:00.589 --> 01:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
posted and then hired in time for a
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
start date in January so you think
 
01:49:05.589 --> 01:49:05.599 align:start position:0%
that's a good date well the way I read
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
it yeah I mean that's what I saw the
 
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
2025 yeah right yeah I think that's F
 
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
about that is if we put a five set sun
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
fiveyear sunset on it that's only two
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
years after the ban takes place right or
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
am I wrong respect to be clear as I
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
understood what the chair said the five
 
01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
years would run starting after the date
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
of the ban which would put us out to
 
01:49:31.149 --> 01:49:31.159 align:start position:0%
2013 which I think is ample time I
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
thought that was very generous of me it
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
today okay now I'll open up to the
 
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
committee does anybody else have
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
anything else they want to participate
 
01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:46.109 align:start position:0%
anything else they want to participate
representative

01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
hmond uh so when that fiveyear Sunset
 
01:49:52.109 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
comes up how will the legislature
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether or not to continue what
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
are the metrics that we could look at if
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
if anybody has ideas on
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
that go ahead if you if you want to I I
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
would I would presume that uh the agency
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
would report on the success or of you
 
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
know really you know evaluate the
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
success of the program and also the
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
workload associated with the continued
 
01:50:17.229 --> 01:50:17.239 align:start position:0%
administration of the ban and then uh
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation to the I mean
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not be honest I'm not entirely sure
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
how that would happen in mechanically
 
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
but from our perspective we would
 
01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
evaluate you know what what uh personnel
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
and labor load implementation and
 
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
administration of the band was imposing
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
on us and determine whether you know we
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
might come back and say it's working
 
01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
great a lot of states are on there isn't
 
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
a heavy load we could we could do this
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
with a part-time position or we could uh
 
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
you know incorporate it into an existing
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
position or you know we report I was
 
01:50:51.870 --> 01:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
kind of hoping it'll be like Mercury
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
where we don't need any position sure
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
that and we would hope for the same
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
thing sure I had a thought um if if you
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
folks uh would like something in the
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
bill that asked the agency to come back
 
01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
and report in five years on the program
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think I mean I actually kind of
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
like that idea I don't want to burden
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
you guys any the idea of the sunset is
 
01:51:17.870 --> 01:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
to force that conversation to occur yeah
 
01:51:20.430 --> 01:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
rather than put any sort of report Lang
 
01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:21.800 align:start position:0%
they would have to come in and say and
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
talk well so the other the other uh
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
response I was thinking for um
 
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ammon is that somebody
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
then could propose a bill to extend the
 
01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
position and then you could have the
 
01:51:37.069 --> 01:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
conversation as part of that either way
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
um bill that's exactly why I suggested
 
01:51:45.790 --> 01:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
the sunset I I you are kiding okay okay
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
represent yeah thank you for that uh I
 
01:51:49.709 --> 01:51:49.719 align:start position:0%
so when you said the word success I
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
guess I was just trying to foresee how
 
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
do we measure success uh other than the
 
01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
workload for the Department Ju Just so I
 
01:51:58.709 --> 01:51:58.719 align:start position:0%
have in mind if we're talking about this
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
in five years you know what we're
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
looking for I I I think our measurement
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
of success would be you know we've got a
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
person working on this and they're doing
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
compliance monitoring and and
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate enforcement are they large
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
Su a great success would be they do this
 
01:52:14.589 --> 01:52:14.599 align:start position:0%
compliance monitoring and they really
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
find that all the all the banss are
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
being complied with and they need to do
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
very little enforcement um you know
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
moderate success might be most it's
 
01:52:25.229 --> 01:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
mostly complied with but we have to do a
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
couple of enforcement actions each year
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
for a particular product and then report
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
to the legislature on that you know and
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
also how much labor I mean how much time
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
do we really need to log um of a
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
person's you know time uh on an annual
 
01:52:41.790 --> 01:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
basis to to appropriately do this
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement okay Mr chairman oh yes re m
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
u thank you you just a real quick
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
question one of the things that you said
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
is that uh to test a product you had to
 
01:52:58.270 --> 01:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
buy the product and bring it back to a
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
lab is there an instrument that you can
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
scan a product and and it will reflect
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
whether it has a past or not um that's a
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
great question and I'm not sure about
 
01:53:12.350 --> 01:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
that for p i mean the analysis and the
 
01:53:13.870 --> 01:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
and the technology associated with
 
01:53:16.589 --> 01:53:16.599 align:start position:0%
analyzing for past is advancing every
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
month because so many people are working
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
on it and doing inst there's so much
 
01:53:22.589 --> 01:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
time and money being spent on past I
 
01:53:25.470 --> 01:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
will tell you that in in our products um
 
01:53:28.709 --> 01:53:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh Tex and packaging uh work we actually
 
01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
there is a handheld device called an
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
x-ray uh U an xrf an x-ray defraction I
 
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
think it is um that uh um that quickly
 
01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
and cheaply in in real time measures
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
Metals concentrations and we've used
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
that to scan packaging in the past if we
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
find that we think that a particular
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
package doesn't meet the requirements
 
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
for a given toxic metal we would then
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
take a samp purchase and Sample it and
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
send it to a lab because in order to do
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
an enforcement case you got to have
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
reliable laboratory data so there are
 
01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
examples of that and whether that exists
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
for past right now I'm I I doubt but
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
it's certainly possible in the future
 
01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:13.470 align:start position:0%
it's certainly possible in the future
could

01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
exist thank you very
 
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
much any other questions in the
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
committee members seeing none thank you
 
01:54:23.589 --> 01:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh can I just ask yes so with within one
 
01:54:25.629 --> 01:54:25.639 align:start position:0%
week next Wednesday we're going to see
 
01:54:27.229 --> 01:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
another amendment and that's when we get
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
to vote on it again maybe maybe we'll be
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
ready maybe we won't but we'll try to
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
get theoretically we have all our you
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
know issues have been addressed just
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure thank you and make
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
sure that exemption list is nice and
 
01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
long right and if I may my former
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
chemistry professor would be ashamed of
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
me it's xway for fluoresence that's what
 
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
xrf stands for there we go well I was
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
just going to say I'll I'll I'll work
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
with um the toxicologist to try to come
 
01:55:00.510 --> 01:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
up with a definition that works um even
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
though I will hate it regarding uh hfos
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
yes that I know you hat you have I said
 
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
that yes you made it perfectly
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
clear all right thank you all right
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
moving right
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
along uh
 
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
1674 establishing the new legal tender
 
01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
act in saing estate bullion
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
depository so my question to you is that
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
you people if they have this thing
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
exists aren't they going to be using
 
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.360 align:start position:0%
digital technology to pay
 
01:55:37.629 --> 01:55:37.639 align:start position:0%
bills and isn't that exactly what you
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
don't want up there in that government
 
01:55:42.589 --> 01:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
Central Banking digital currency so
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to start there yeah answer
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
that question for me so I I so I have a
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
clear understanding so this has to deal
 
01:55:51.709 --> 01:55:51.719 align:start position:0%
with tokenizing real world assets
 
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
tokenizing sounds like tokenizing real
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
world assets just remember that phrase
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
because this committee if if this is the
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
domain uh the subject matter committee
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
for uh for currencies like that right
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
right we're GNA have to understand all
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
these things so tokenizing real world
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
assets gold would be a physical asset it
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
would be held in a depository right um
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
and it would be audited to make sure
 
01:56:18.589 --> 01:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
that the tokens issued the receipts the
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
digital receipts for or your deposit are
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
backed by the are backed one to one
 
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
right and redeemable for and because
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
that's on a blockchain it's open source
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the key difference between a
 
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
central bank digital currency which
 
01:56:35.229 --> 01:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
would be closed source that the
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
government could change at any
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
time uh the the token Blain now we're
 
01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
issued on the blockchain open source
 
01:56:44.669 --> 01:56:44.679 align:start position:0%
open source and that's the difference
 
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
because you can trust exactly what it's
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
doing that's the key word that I and I
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
do know that right now do know I do know
 
01:56:51.629 --> 01:56:51.639 align:start position:0%
about it but so here's Here's my thought
 
01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill it's not ready for prime
 
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
time I'm going to admit that to you um I
 
01:56:58.030 --> 01:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't know I think about
 
01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
half of the business subcommittee was at
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
the hearing and so what I sent out
 
01:57:05.709 --> 01:57:05.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday I know it's a lot to digest is
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
a transcript of the entire hearing um I
 
01:57:10.109 --> 01:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
sent that to the whole committee I have
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
a couple copies here we probably don't
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
need to look at it this minute but I did
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
I used AI on the transcript and I said
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
list all the pros and cons and who said
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
those pros and cons so that's the first
 
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
page that's your executive summary of
 
01:57:25.149 --> 01:57:25.159 align:start position:0%
the transcript it says who said it if
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
you want to go find that person and and
 
01:57:30.069 --> 01:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
read exactly what they said um so I
 
01:57:31.390 --> 01:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
really liked this when you sent this to
 
01:57:32.709 --> 01:57:32.719 align:start position:0%
me and I was reading it over it was
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
great so so maybe we can punt until next
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
week and have a little more discussion
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
about it and uh and save some time today
 
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
then you'll be ready for inter room
 
01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.870 align:start position:0%
then you'll be ready for inter room
study

01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:57:45.910 --> 01:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay yes I'm I'm just fascinated but
 
01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
representative ad about the AI par I I
 
01:57:49.750 --> 01:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
know this is probably unrelated how did
 
01:57:52.069 --> 01:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
you feed in the information and then and
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
do it how do you do that you just
 
01:57:55.629 --> 01:57:55.639 align:start position:0%
scanned it all in AI is very uh
 
01:57:57.950 --> 01:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
intuitive it it's not very it's not
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
intimidating to try it no I refused A
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so you can upload documents
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
and then ask it questions okay so you
 
01:58:04.270 --> 01:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
uploaded it and you can give it
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
instructions and you can say that's you
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
can say uh that's that's good but
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
improve this area you know and holy
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll it'll it's like an assistant
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
that you can uh right we saw the one we
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
we had was it when we said bill it said
 
01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.669 align:start position:0%
we had was it when we said bill it said
invoice

01:58:20.669 --> 01:58:20.679 align:start position:0%
invoice
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
that all our house bills were house
 
01:58:26.430 --> 01:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
invoices especially and what was the one
 
01:58:28.069 --> 01:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
for representative what did it say to
 
01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
change change us represented to be with
 
01:58:32.350 --> 01:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
consultant or something or yeah it was
 
01:58:34.589 --> 01:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
like yeah a bill was an invoice and it
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
was just trying to avoid copyright law
 
01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:40.229 align:start position:0%
was just trying to avoid copyright law
that's

01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.910 --> 01:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
represent so I looked through this bill
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
quite a bit in quite a bit of
 
01:58:48.189 --> 01:58:48.199 align:start position:0%
detail and having written we're going to
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
talk about this next week understand
 
01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
that but in in light of people talking
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
about it I would like them to understand
 
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
some of the things that I found and to
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
see where I'm coming from on this
 
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
because I have spent a lot of time on
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
this I've seen preliminaries of this
 
01:59:06.589 --> 01:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
bill over the summer and I have spent
 
01:59:08.189 --> 01:59:08.199 align:start position:0%
months on
 
01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
it my first problem is two problems my
 
01:59:14.189 --> 01:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
first problem is that it reads like a
 
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
statement of
 
01:59:18.669 --> 01:59:18.679 align:start position:0%
work to set up a business if you know
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
what a statement of work is I can go
 
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
into that but but to set up a business
 
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
for which we have absolutely no legal
 
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
definition no legal boundaries like we
 
01:59:32.189 --> 01:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
did with the da we passed the da bill it
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
was very comprehensive it was very good
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
it cut at least answered everything I
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
cared about and things I never even
 
01:59:42.270 --> 01:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
thought of this thing presents no legal
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
boundaries problem with that is that's
 
01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
our job that's what we're supposed to be
 
01:59:49.990 --> 01:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
doing right we're setting up a business
 
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
we would create the and there is none in
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
here now it does have some things about
 
01:59:58.270 --> 01:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
an open- Source blockchain except that
 
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
when you deal with stablecoin so much of
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
what happens with stablecoin doesn't
 
02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
happen on the blockchain the purchase of
 
02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
the gold the keeping of the books the
 
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
the uh fees that are charged that's not
 
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
part of the chain so doesn't have
 
02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
privacy does it I'm sorry doesn't have
 
02:00:15.830 --> 02:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
much privacy
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
that it tell everybody anybody could go
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
down that much you have this the the
 
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
depository may know if you go to redeem
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
it but okay other than that they won't
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
so that part may be covered but all the
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
rest of it is not in the bill it says
 
02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
that this Treasurer appoints a
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
representative to go set all that
 
02:00:40.589 --> 02:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
up that's supposed to be our
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
job not some representative who we have
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
no control over and don't know what
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
they've done okay we have what was your
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
other issue the other is issue uh there
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
is two paragraphs at the end of this
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
thing this is still part of the first
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
issue there's two paragraphs at the end
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
of this thing that says the state of New
 
02:01:02.910 --> 02:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will block the federal
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
government from investigating any
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
illegal Acts or any acts that are
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
happening by owners of the
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
wallets that are in this chain which
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
means we are going to act as a wall read
 
02:01:18.629 --> 02:01:18.639 align:start position:0%
the last two paragraphs we are going to
 
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
act as a wall between anybody
 
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
wishing to do any kind of crazy thing
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
that they do these days with this stuff
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
and it's about A40 billion dollar since
 
02:01:34.149 --> 02:01:34.159 align:start position:0%
2022 blockchains for uh I mean not
 
02:01:35.709 --> 02:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
blockchains I'm sorry stable coins have
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
been used for $40 billion in illegal
 
02:01:40.109 --> 02:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
activities so it's not something that
 
02:01:42.310 --> 02:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
maybe it happens once in a while and
 
02:01:45.069 --> 02:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
these things include
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
ransomware and all kind if you disagree
 
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
please tell me because that's not what
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'm reading there yeah I mean I think
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
your inter your what you said could be
 
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
one interpretation of what it says um
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
but it's it's not explicitly exactly the
 
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
way you put it um but that's the point
 
02:02:04.069 --> 02:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
but so let me go let me just back up I
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
agree with you that this bill is not
 
02:02:07.629 --> 02:02:07.639 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time so I guess we're
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
discussing whether kill it 100% or
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
interim study or turn it into a study
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
commission I think those would be the
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
three there but there's one other aspect
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
we're setting this thing up as a
 
02:02:18.159 --> 02:02:19.790 align:start position:0%
we're setting this thing up as a
business

02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
have we done one bit of analysis that
 
02:02:24.310 --> 02:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
says this state has any hope of
 
02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
recuperating the money so make it a
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
business but those are the questions
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
you're posing yeah I got it those are
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
you'll add that to your ai ai list okay
 
02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:36.669 align:start position:0%
you'll add that to your ai ai list okay
representa

02:02:36.669 --> 02:02:36.679 align:start position:0%
representa
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
ton and and I have to ask this question
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
in honor of my late professor James
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
Buchanan who won a Nobel Prize for
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
this you're
 
02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
you're and clarify when you refer to
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
bullion and tokenization of real world
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
assets you're only referring to gold is
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
that correct you're not referring to
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
silver or or bricks as it's it's gold
 
02:03:02.669 --> 02:03:02.679 align:start position:0%
and silver you wouldn't do platinum and
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't I'm I'm asking the question
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
we could so so the the way I see this is
 
02:03:08.669 --> 02:03:08.679 align:start position:0%
sort of like an entryway into uh the
 
02:03:13.149 --> 02:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
state becoming uh you know Reserve
 
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
understanding understanding the
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
tokenization aspect so you can tokenize
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
lots of different things yeah professor
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
buan prize was re awarded for his work
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
on establishing
 
02:03:28.990 --> 02:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
bricks as clay bricks as a reserve so
 
02:03:30.270 --> 02:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
that would incentivize the production of
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
bricks which would or there was a finite
 
02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
number of bricks therefore you could
 
02:03:35.950 --> 02:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
limit the expansion or contraction of
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
currency based on the availability of
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
bricks because that because I could make
 
02:03:41.709 --> 02:03:41.719 align:start position:0%
bricks in the mud with my backyard right
 
02:03:43.109 --> 02:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
corre well you could go M gold in your
 
02:03:45.390 --> 02:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
backyard it's not scarce the way gold is
 
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
but everything is relatively scarce so I
 
02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
not to go down too far down that rabbit
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
hole and I I don't know that I think
 
02:03:54.149 --> 02:03:54.159 align:start position:0%
it's a bad Bill I just want to be clear
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
it's a specific we're talking about
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
bullion as simply gold and silver not
 
02:04:00.119 --> 02:04:01.629 align:start position:0%
bullion as simply gold and silver not
tokenization

02:04:01.629 --> 02:04:01.639 align:start position:0%
tokenization
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
of other assets not Platinum but maybe
 
02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
Platinum would make sense later on you
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
know I I don't know all right um if if
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
you want so there's a there's a a
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
discussion about the cost and I that's a
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
valid and the return to the investor
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
which in this case is the state of New
 
02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
that gets to where my issue is but let
 
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
me just talk about uh the fees that that
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
but let me mine's really easy I'm
 
02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
against the state state bank yeah this
 
02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
says State depository that sounds like a
 
02:04:35.229 --> 02:04:35.239 align:start position:0%
state bank to me and I'm against indate
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
bit I really think that there's no
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
there's no lending or financial services
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
out of the deposit it's just it's just a
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
a storage of the that's what my my B my
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
bank got out of the depository business
 
02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
and now just into private wealth let me
 
02:04:53.549 --> 02:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
just talk so I this should best be done
 
02:04:56.990 --> 02:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
by a private Enterprise all right so
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's my we can talk about that next
 
02:05:01.149 --> 02:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
week I I have an amendment that does
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
need some work but what it would do is
 
02:05:04.750 --> 02:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
create like a licensing scheme for the
 
02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
state if somebody wants to go and do
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
this as a private business I would be
 
02:05:10.549 --> 02:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
more I'd be more attractive to that
 
02:05:12.549 --> 02:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
concept than having the state involved
 
02:05:13.990 --> 02:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
if if I could if we're going to talk
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
about it um so in the digital asset
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
space there there's the idea of a
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
sovereign uh giving its uh stamp of
 
02:05:26.830 --> 02:05:26.840 align:start position:0%
approval its guarantee on a digital
 
02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
asset would give that uh would create a
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
a trust in that asset in the in the
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
digital economy right most likely yeah
 
02:05:39.069 --> 02:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
um but if you wanted to look at so
 
02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
tokenized gold is about it's about
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
there's about 10 million of tokenized
 
02:05:47.149 --> 02:05:47.159 align:start position:0%
gold it's not very big transferred every
 
02:05:51.069 --> 02:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
24 hours okay so if the state got 10% of
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
that that would be 1 million every 24
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
hours right potentially I'm just giving
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
you a rough estimate and that's
 
02:06:02.189 --> 02:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
$365 million a year if we if if the
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
token extracted a 1% fee from each of
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
those transactions that's about 3. and
 
02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
how many people do you need on that
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
chain to achieve that how many investors
 
02:06:12.669 --> 02:06:12.679 align:start position:0%
do you need in this thing have you done
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
that analysis has anyone done that
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
analysis I'm just saying like
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
potentially if those tokens were traded
 
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
it could be a source of revenue for the
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
state how do you start it up is a is a
 
02:06:23.069 --> 02:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
big question I don't have the answers
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
for that so but that's the thing without
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
doing that without doing that analysis
 
02:06:29.149 --> 02:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
don't pass that don't pass this every
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
time we see the state bank they always
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
say this will be a good economic thing
 
02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
for the state to getv but you can see
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
those metrics now like in the open
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
should should the state be in the
 
02:06:38.480 --> 02:06:40.109 align:start position:0%
should should the state be in the
Cannabis

02:06:40.109 --> 02:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
Cannabis
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
business have we moved
 
02:06:46.030 --> 02:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
on I think we're moved on yes can I ask
 
02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:47.589 align:start position:0%
on I think we're moved on yes can I ask
a

02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:49.390 align:start position:0%
a
question

02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.790 align:start position:0%
question
yes

02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
um representative Amon what what is the
 
02:06:56.109 --> 02:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
Practical purpose of all this I I it
 
02:06:59.229 --> 02:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
seems to me it's sort of an ideological
 
02:07:01.950 --> 02:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
type of thing as opposed to it should be
 
02:07:04.270 --> 02:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you how I I think about it
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
if you yeah let's let's do that next
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
week we can do it next week we'll do
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
that yeah put on your list of things to
 
02:07:12.390 --> 02:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
discuss I I'll talk about $34 trillion
 
02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
in debt and how the interest on the debt
 
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
is surpassing the military spending
 
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's my okay
 
02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
all right last but not least
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
establishing a condominium dispute
 
02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.350 align:start position:0%
establishing a condominium dispute
resolution

02:07:24.350 --> 02:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
board okay anybody want to weigh in on
 
02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:28.069 align:start position:0%
board okay anybody want to weigh in on
this

02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:30.549 --> 02:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
one we're not taking testimony but you
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
can certainly sit there if anybody has a
 
02:07:34.639 --> 02:07:36.270 align:start position:0%
can certainly sit there if anybody has a
question

02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:07:38.549 --> 02:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
what right so you have an amendment for
 
02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
is okay if you want to have that in
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
public record why don't you come up and
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
say it into the microphone so the public
 
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
knows where where
 
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment yeah but you you've been in
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
the legislature not long enough to know
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
that something's at the end of the list
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
that starts at 10 that that you would
 
02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:22.430 align:start position:0%
that starts at 10 that that you would
not

02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:27.549 --> 02:08:27.559 align:start position:0%
sorry this is off uh on that committees
 
02:08:30.750 --> 02:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
that have Mi decided to take we're
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
taking this one next and we're taking
 
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
that one after that and it's totally
 
02:08:38.549 --> 02:08:38.559 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the order oh no I we do buy
 
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
things by order but okay okay so um we
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to put this bill into the office
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
of profession professional uh licensure
 
02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:51.430 align:start position:0%
of profession professional uh licensure
and

02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:53.149 align:start position:0%
and
certification

02:08:53.149 --> 02:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
on we didn't I in particular uh did not
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
realize that that was no longer an
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
option in this state because they
 
02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
totally revised the offic of
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
professional licens certification last
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
year all I knew was that they had gotten
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
rid of the manufactured housing board
 
02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
which this is based on on
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
FR that was Friday that I had a nice
 
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
long conversation with the people behind
 
02:09:26.549 --> 02:09:26.559 align:start position:0%
you who've also been here the whole time
 
02:09:31.149 --> 02:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
on to discuss um whether the office of
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
professional lenser could take it or not
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
the only way they could take it would be
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
if they licensed people John Hunt's rule
 
02:09:38.639 --> 02:09:39.629 align:start position:0%
if they licensed people John Hunt's rule
of

02:09:39.629 --> 02:09:39.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
lure and they don't license people I
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
mean they couldn't license people in
 
02:09:47.709 --> 02:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
this case nothing that would make any
 
02:09:50.109 --> 02:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
sense what whatever it also would cost a
 
02:09:53.189 --> 02:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
lot more than it would cost if it was
 
02:09:56.430 --> 02:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
done in the model of the old
 
02:09:58.990 --> 02:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board which was
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
quite successful until it worked itself
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
out of a job which I would hope this one
 
02:10:06.669 --> 02:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
would do but it does take about 20 years
 
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
probably uh and all we
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
need is a uh Administrative Assistant
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
but we need place for them to sit
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
on the Deputy Commissioner of Das is
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
talking to the commissioner today about
 
02:10:28.589 --> 02:10:28.599 align:start position:0%
where that could possibly be I tried
 
02:10:31.149 --> 02:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
first to go to the governor's office and
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
before the primary nobody was in the
 
02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
governor's office they were just leave
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
telling you to leave messages and I
 
02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if today's any better uh and
 
02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:46.750 align:start position:0%
don't know if today's any better uh and
I

02:10:46.750 --> 02:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
on I left left a message also for Ben
 
02:10:51.709 --> 02:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
Frost of New Hampshire housing but I
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
don't think they're allowed to attach
 
02:10:59.149 --> 02:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
anything any what Ben I think he retired
 
02:11:03.069 --> 02:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
Ben Frost retired when did Ben reti last
 
02:11:05.229 --> 02:11:05.239 align:start position:0%
yeah no maybe not there's another person
 
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
that is that took his place so maybe he
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
still he just he got kicked
 
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
upstairs he K Ked upstairs again okay
 
02:11:17.310 --> 02:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
anyway so uh so therefore you're saying
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
at this point this
 
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
you're begging us to interim study the
 
02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:23.719 align:start position:0%
bill no I'm not I'm begging you to give
 
02:11:27.790 --> 02:11:27.800 align:start position:0%

03:32:42.429 --> 03:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
1198 and
 
03:32:46.990 --> 03:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.830 --> 03:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
1198 Mr chairman isn't this basically
 
03:32:52.990 --> 03:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
the same bill we had two years
 
03:32:56.550 --> 03:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
ago uh that we attempted to we attempted
 
03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
to do something and then the Senate
 
03:32:58.479 --> 03:33:00.750 align:start position:0%
to do something and then the Senate
killed

03:33:00.750 --> 03:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
killed
 
03:33:05.870 --> 03:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
it so yeah he evidently he he uh his
 
03:33:09.670 --> 03:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
mother died I just saw him oh he is here
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
for him I just saw him is Tim Tim are
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
you here not here he would have been
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
here because SCH
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:26.389 --> 03:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
then that was no well that was just the
 
03:33:33.070 --> 03:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
have nobody's here to present it so we
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
didn't present this is a well not
 
03:33:41.349 --> 03:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
present it sub committee
 
03:33:44.110 --> 03:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
to talk about so you don't care about no
 
03:33:48.110 --> 03:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
I think we're Easter Thanksgiving
 
03:33:51.030 --> 03:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
Day when never appointed and Christmas
 
03:33:56.070 --> 03:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
Comm all right nobody wants to speak for
 
03:33:59.600 --> 03:34:00.790 align:start position:0%
Comm all right nobody wants to speak for
this

03:34:00.790 --> 03:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:34:03.429 --> 03:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
bill I I wasn't here for the testimony
 
03:34:05.830 --> 03:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
so is this just like right now things
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
aren't open on certain holidays but
 
03:34:10.830 --> 03:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
Sundays are always open right we are
 
03:34:12.630 --> 03:34:12.640 align:start position:0%
open on Sundays yeah right so why does
 
03:34:15.670 --> 03:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:19.550 --> 03:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:22.110 --> 03:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
holiday not with any otheris law
 
03:34:24.510 --> 03:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
commission may in its
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
discretion open provision so so
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
theoretically if they can't find
 
03:34:31.349 --> 03:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
employees or there's going to be a
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
problem they might not be open on Sunday
 
03:34:35.550 --> 03:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
but as far as I
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
know so who's working Aiden are you
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
working this
 
03:34:39.680 --> 03:34:43.550 align:start position:0%
working this
bill

03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:44.950 --> 03:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
you could take your jacket off and stay
 
03:34:44.960 --> 03:34:52.030 align:start position:0%
you could take your jacket off and stay
a

03:34:52.030 --> 03:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.550 --> 03:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
while what you don't have a sports C oh
 
03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:01.920 --> 03:35:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
does

03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:35:06.309 --> 03:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
okay are there any liquor stores that
 
03:35:08.269 --> 03:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
are actually closed on
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
Sunday not that I'm aare of Mr chairman
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
Moore uh legal coordinator for the
 
03:35:14.670 --> 03:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission not that I'm aware of
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
I think uh of course on Sundays you have
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
Easter which is on a Sunday yeah that's
 
03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
the holidays but we just want to clear
 
03:35:25.110 --> 03:35:25.120 align:start position:0%
up Sunday is the question um I can't say
 
03:35:27.349 --> 03:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
with 100% certainty whether some of the
 
03:35:29.150 --> 03:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
stores are not closed especially if
 
03:35:31.790 --> 03:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
they're in locations where it doesn't
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
make sense to keep them open but I think
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
the commission will always try to get as
 
03:35:38.950 --> 03:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
much of uh sales receipts as they
 
03:35:42.150 --> 03:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
can right so that was that your only
 
03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
question yeah yeah I was just I thought
 
03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
they were open on Sunday so I was
 
03:35:46.590 --> 03:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
confused as to what the point of Sunday
 
03:35:48.790 --> 03:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
is that's why I was asking right but at
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
the end of the day is that the
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
commission could have a certain store
 
03:35:55.870 --> 03:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
not open on a Sunday based on the
 
03:35:58.510 --> 03:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
statute the current statute the current
 
03:36:00.630 --> 03:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
statute yeah the only the the bill is
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:05.760 --> 03:36:07.309 align:start position:0%
 
out

03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:36:11.469 --> 03:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
right Mr chairman question yes um so
 
03:36:13.150 --> 03:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
what this bill does basically it says
 
03:36:15.469 --> 03:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
that the the commission could could be
 
03:36:18.229 --> 03:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
opened on Easter or Thanksgiving that's
 
03:36:22.189 --> 03:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
correct or Christmas or Christmas no
 
03:36:24.670 --> 03:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
less I think it's because it's not a
 
03:36:27.550 --> 03:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
good idea because you sound like one of
 
03:36:31.389 --> 03:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:33.750 --> 03:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
vill no we don't want to micro ranage
 
03:36:34.910 --> 03:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
The Liquor
 
03:36:37.269 --> 03:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
Commission I mean giving them the
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
flexibility to do it but they don't have
 
03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
to do it right now was that was the
 
03:36:44.389 --> 03:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor's premise that I don't see
 
03:36:47.469 --> 03:36:47.479 align:start position:0%
anything offensive about that right Mr
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
chair no I'd like to move
 
03:36:55.750 --> 03:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
itl okay repres pusc moves inexp to
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:08.469 --> 03:37:08.479 align:start position:0%
purposes any discussion on the motion of
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.590 --> 03:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
I mean what is the logic behind it you
 
03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
just don't like the idea of them being
 
03:37:20.590 --> 03:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
open those days I think I think it's uh
 
03:37:24.030 --> 03:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
the Press is saying that yeah that that
 
03:37:26.269 --> 03:37:26.279 align:start position:0%
we're closed on Hol on the on these
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
holidays I mean I say let the I kind of
 
03:37:35.830 --> 03:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
like what Jane just said just why just
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
let them do it if it makes sense and if
 
03:37:39.349 --> 03:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't then don't do it they won't
 
03:37:42.269 --> 03:37:42.279 align:start position:0%
do it that's my logic that's my thinking
 
03:37:44.229 --> 03:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
right you're you're an
 
03:37:48.030 --> 03:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
enabler yes I enable all sorts of bad
 
03:37:52.670 --> 03:37:52.680 align:start position:0%

03:37:52.680 --> 03:37:54.229 align:start position:0%

enaer
 
03:37:56.870 --> 03:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you um am I right that
 
03:38:01.510 --> 03:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
employees willing to work on those
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
holidays would get time and a
 
03:38:06.510 --> 03:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
half uh
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
they what Aiden you were supposed to be
 
03:38:13.229 --> 03:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:13.239 --> 03:38:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
don't

03:38:14.550 --> 03:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
move I don't I want you to stay right
 
03:38:21.189 --> 03:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
there in the next bill
 
03:38:23.309 --> 03:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
too representative could you repeat your
 
03:38:23.319 --> 03:38:24.269 align:start position:0%
too representative could you repeat your
question

03:38:24.269 --> 03:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
please am I right that employees willing
 
03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
to work on those holidays would get time
 
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
and a half uh for the hours that they
 
03:38:35.189 --> 03:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
work on the holidays yes it it it's not
 
03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
currently in the state employees
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement as far
 
03:38:41.070 --> 03:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
as um those holidays is and whether or
 
03:38:43.309 --> 03:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
not I think those that agreement would
 
03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to go back and be negotiated to see
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not there were any additional
 
03:38:49.630 --> 03:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
terms that the that the union would like
 
03:38:53.150 --> 03:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
to have added if they were going to be
 
03:38:56.950 --> 03:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh told to work on Christmas or Easter
 
03:38:59.309 --> 03:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
um but under the current contract if
 
03:39:01.710 --> 03:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
they work on Sundays they do get time
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
and a
 
03:39:05.990 --> 03:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
half so the current contract doesn't
 
03:39:08.990 --> 03:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
provide for holidays one way or the
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
other if a full-time employee they would
 
03:39:13.630 --> 03:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
get the same holiday pay so for example
 
03:39:15.349 --> 03:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
if you're a state employee and you're
 
03:39:17.070 --> 03:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
working on a holiday you'll get paid for
 
03:39:19.150 --> 03:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
that day and paid for the holiday so
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
you'll pretty much get double pay that's
 
03:39:22.830 --> 03:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
what I was going to say I thought it was
 
03:39:25.990 --> 03:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
double pay and so that's can include
 
03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:27.630 align:start position:0%
double pay and so that's can include
Columbus

the other representative suan that this
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
is Commerce Let There Be Commerce if
 
03:39:54.750 --> 03:39:54.760 align:start position:0%

03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
not that's that's my well um I would say
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
is that uh we did pass this bill in its
 
03:40:08.429 --> 03:40:08.439 align:start position:0%
current form uh and the Senate killed
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
it that's not a reason to pass a good
 
03:40:10.880 --> 03:40:12.030 align:start position:0%
it that's not a reason to pass a good
bill

03:40:12.030 --> 03:40:12.040 align:start position:0%

03:40:42.269 --> 03:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
okay doesn't matter either way yeah
 
03:40:44.349 --> 03:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
exactly the Bill's going to die in the
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
Senate well unless the Senators feel I'm
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
sure representative selan when he goes
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
over and speak to it on this when the
 
03:40:51.790 --> 03:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
when the hearing on the Senate side
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
you'll have a compelling argument why I
 
03:40:55.510 --> 03:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
bet it'll be real
 
03:40:57.950 --> 03:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
exciting and say it's simply
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
enabling um I would say that just for
 
03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
the record is the S position is that uh
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
as much as it is enabling they really
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
didn't want the Liquor Commission to
 
03:41:13.630 --> 03:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
even contemplate the idea of these three
 
03:41:17.269 --> 03:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
holidays and and get into
 
03:41:22.110 --> 03:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
negotiation with the um Union the Union
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of doing it or how well would
 
03:41:27.790 --> 03:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
it take to get it done that uh that the
 
03:41:29.550 --> 03:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
better part of valor they just said it's
 
03:41:32.790 --> 03:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's fine let's leave these three days
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
as we're close those three days that was
 
03:41:37.950 --> 03:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate position
 
03:41:40.189 --> 03:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
gotcha you sure you still want to go go
 
03:41:43.790 --> 03:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
with this motion yeah why not I just
 
03:41:45.189 --> 03:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
it's not a huge deal one with the other
 
03:41:46.590 --> 03:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
but it just seems like let the let the
 
03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
liquor store the liquor be a business
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
and run the business you certainly like
 
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:01.149 --> 03:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
well putting words in his mouth I MTH he
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
agreed that he was an enabler so and I'm
 
03:42:06.429 --> 03:42:06.439 align:start position:0%
just saying and let and giving them
 
03:42:08.309 --> 03:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
enabling them
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
to make that to maximize their profits
 
03:42:13.950 --> 03:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
for our state let's give is their charge
 
03:42:13.960 --> 03:42:15.429 align:start position:0%
for our state let's give is their charge
you

03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:42:18.510 --> 03:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
correct okay so the motion is uh ought
 
03:42:21.070 --> 03:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
to pass any more discussion on the
 
03:42:21.080 --> 03:42:25.750 align:start position:0%
to pass any more discussion on the
motion

03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
so the I was withdrawn because you were
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%

of the old days before they had this
 
03:44:17.630 --> 03:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
replacement thing pairing always seem to
 
03:44:21.510 --> 03:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
work well it works well for the Senate
 
03:44:22.990 --> 03:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
this is not a political
 
03:44:25.110 --> 03:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill it's not a polit this is a
 
03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill it's a bipartisan it's a
 
03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan bill it's a nonpartisan bill
 
03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
so you people could vote any direction
 
03:44:34.750 --> 03:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
on it so you could go any way you want
 
03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's right so you should all the
 
03:44:38.110 --> 03:44:38.120 align:start position:0%

certain information in liquor stores
 
03:44:59.550 --> 03:44:59.560 align:start position:0%

amendment

03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:27.750 align:start position:0%

03:45:33.870 --> 03:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chairman members of the
 
03:45:36.030 --> 03:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
committee um for allowing me to speak to
 
03:45:39.030 --> 03:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um it gives me an opportunity
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
to fill in the gaps uh that were left
 
03:45:43.309 --> 03:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
when I missed the original hearing on
 
03:45:47.910 --> 03:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
this bill so um uh I I did watch the
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh my co-sponsor uh
 
03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative priest did a very good
 
03:45:55.469 --> 03:45:55.479 align:start position:0%
job without any warning that he was
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
going to be introducing the bill um but
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
there are some things I'd like to fill
 
03:46:01.750 --> 03:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
in and clarify and and um first the
 
03:46:03.790 --> 03:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
amendment um these were these were
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
issues really that came out of drafting
 
03:46:08.229 --> 03:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
um it was redrafted and it came out on
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
the last day and and they were they were
 
03:46:12.349 --> 03:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
things that I had discussed with uh
 
03:46:14.590 --> 03:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
folks that helped put this together
 
03:46:16.189 --> 03:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
along the way that just didn't make it
 
03:46:19.149 --> 03:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
in so hopefully this amendment addresses
 
03:46:20.990 --> 03:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
things um and I did see some of them
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
came up during your original hearing um
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
it it it is meant to focus on on both
 
03:46:28.990 --> 03:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
Wine and Liquor any products sold at the
 
03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
state liquor stores um it was meant to
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
include the option to distribute
 
03:46:37.870 --> 03:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
information in formats other other than
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
the um the than than a printed brochure
 
03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
But it includes a printed brochure um
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
and it also clarifies what the referral
 
03:46:49.070 --> 03:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
resource um that that the bill speaks to
 
03:46:51.229 --> 03:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
is so um I won't go through the details
 
03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
of it but certainly um glad to discuss
 
03:46:56.349 --> 03:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
those items um I'm just going to quickly
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
run through sort of a general
 
03:47:01.349 --> 03:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
presentation of the uh of the bill um I
 
03:47:02.830 --> 03:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
know there were some questions about
 
03:47:06.149 --> 03:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
need and um the costs associated with
 
03:47:08.790 --> 03:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
drinking so I'll just pull out a couple
 
03:47:10.750 --> 03:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
of statistics there's one that's about
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
10 years old it comes from What's called
 
03:47:16.110 --> 03:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
the CDC stat uh prevention status report
 
03:47:17.710 --> 03:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh specific to New
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it estimated the cost of
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
excessive drinking in the state to be
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
$852 million um per year and it went on
 
03:47:29.070 --> 03:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
to say that it estimates
 
03:47:32.750 --> 03:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
341 deaths and nearly 9,000 years of
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
potential life lost due to um uh
 
03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
excessive drinking that comes from an
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
alcohol related uh disease impact
 
03:47:44.309 --> 03:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
database that they maintain
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
um uh I think you have a piece of
 
03:47:49.590 --> 03:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
testimony from new Futures that also
 
03:47:51.309 --> 03:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
cites that if you factor in loss
 
03:47:53.469 --> 03:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
productivity the costs associated with
 
03:47:55.149 --> 03:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
excessive drinking seed a billion
 
03:47:58.830 --> 03:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in our state um and again
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
that was 2013 that was before the
 
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic by all estimates um alcohol use
 
03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
has risen pretty much everywhere since
 
03:48:10.229 --> 03:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
um since the pandemic um and Sam say uh
 
03:48:11.550 --> 03:48:11.560 align:start position:0%
substance abuse in Mental Health
 
03:48:13.429 --> 03:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
Services Administration
 
03:48:17.229 --> 03:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
Federal uh estimates that one in 10 um
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
roughly one in 10 people as many as one
 
03:48:21.870 --> 03:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
in 10 people uh have alcohol use
 
03:48:25.149 --> 03:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
disorder um it's also true that the top
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
10% of drinkers or it's been cited that
 
03:48:31.030 --> 03:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
the uh top 10% of drinkers consume 60%
 
03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
of the alcohol sold um so basically
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
there's a very relatively small group of
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
the population that um um that we're
 
03:48:43.550 --> 03:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
targeting or or attempting to reach with
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
this with this legislation um that
 
03:48:48.710 --> 03:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
accounts for a lot of what might look
 
03:48:51.070 --> 03:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
like the um you know the people coming
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
through the liquor stores and that's
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
really the the purpose behind this bill
 
03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
um I like to think of it as sort of a
 
03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
lwh hanging fruit kind of bill um
 
03:49:05.429 --> 03:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
because it's based on a lot of things
 
03:49:07.790 --> 03:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
that are already in place the systems uh
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
to identify refer and treat um alcohol
 
03:49:14.670 --> 03:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
use disorder are already in place in the
 
03:49:18.429 --> 03:49:18.439 align:start position:0%
state um and because the state runs the
 
03:49:20.189 --> 03:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
liquor stores there's already routine
 
03:49:23.429 --> 03:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
contact with those most in need you know
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh depending on how often they come in
 
03:49:27.149 --> 03:49:27.159 align:start position:0%
you know possibly multiple times per
 
03:49:29.870 --> 03:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
week of the precise people that this
 
03:49:33.389 --> 03:49:33.399 align:start position:0%
would address um and the systems that
 
03:49:35.950 --> 03:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
the that are the referral base and I I I
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
I cite in here the the 988 system in
 
03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:40.550 align:start position:0%
I cite in here the the 988 system in
particular

03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
um you know are are already the the
 
03:49:44.630 --> 03:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
focus of sort of broad-based marketing
 
03:49:46.389 --> 03:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
efforts to make people aware of them so
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
this would be an opportunity to put that
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:58.630 --> 03:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
um I also sort of look at the the um
 
03:50:00.630 --> 03:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
liquor commission's uh duties I was just
 
03:50:03.229 --> 03:50:03.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned in in the last bill um you
 
03:50:04.750 --> 03:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
know the duty of the Liquor Commission
 
03:50:06.910 --> 03:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
shall be to optim optimize um
 
03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
profitability of the commission and I
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
think this is in keeping with that um if
 
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
you look at the um concept of revenues
 
03:50:15.389 --> 03:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
and excessive
 
03:50:18.990 --> 03:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
expenses um narrowly perhaps not but
 
03:50:20.590 --> 03:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
broadly what are called the
 
03:50:23.469 --> 03:50:23.479 align:start position:0%
externalities of the transactions um are
 
03:50:27.309 --> 03:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
are those costs that I just mentioned um
 
03:50:29.349 --> 03:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
and they shouldn't be treated as zero in
 
03:50:31.269 --> 03:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
that equation in my mind of of
 
03:50:32.910 --> 03:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
profitability it really gets at the
 
03:50:35.670 --> 03:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
state's overall Revenue stream and so if
 
03:50:38.710 --> 03:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
alcohol is uh profitable in one sector
 
03:50:40.590 --> 03:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
but causing a lot of external costs in
 
03:50:43.229 --> 03:50:43.239 align:start position:0%
another sector that I think worth
 
03:50:45.710 --> 03:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
mentioning um and the costs of alcohol
 
03:50:48.990 --> 03:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
use disorder um have been stated mostly
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
born by local municipalities so um all
 
03:50:55.750 --> 03:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
those cost sort of circle back around um
 
03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
I wanted to mention sort of the approach
 
03:51:01.229 --> 03:51:01.239 align:start position:0%
that this takes briefly um it is focused
 
03:51:03.030 --> 03:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
just on the state liquor stores not the
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
licens vendors um for several reasons
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's a single system so everything can
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
happen uniformly
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
um it's not intrusive into uh Private
 
03:51:12.640 --> 03:51:13.630 align:start position:0%
um it's not intrusive into uh Private
Business

03:51:13.630 --> 03:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
Business
 
03:51:17.110 --> 03:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
operations um and it's a uh controlled
 
03:51:19.269 --> 03:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
environment where where it's very clear
 
03:51:22.870 --> 03:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
sort of how transactions take place um I
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
know there was also some concern in the
 
03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
L in the original hearing about this
 
03:51:29.550 --> 03:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
being sort of an uh for lack of a better
 
03:51:32.349 --> 03:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
term Nanny State sort of solution um
 
03:51:33.750 --> 03:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually I want to point out not
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
about warning about the dangers of
 
03:51:37.710 --> 03:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
alcohol or or any of the things that are
 
03:51:39.710 --> 03:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
sort of typically on warning labels and
 
03:51:43.070 --> 03:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
other type of thing this is um this is
 
03:51:45.790 --> 03:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
purely a
 
03:51:50.149 --> 03:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
um uh an effort to basically raise
 
03:51:52.389 --> 03:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
awareness so I lost my place on my page
 
03:51:54.870 --> 03:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
but U
 
03:51:58.030 --> 03:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
um to make existing resources available
 
03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
to help those that that need it um
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
essentially um and then in terms of the
 
03:52:06.110 --> 03:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
the mechanism for distribution as I
 
03:52:07.550 --> 03:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned it wasn't meant to be just a
 
03:52:10.030 --> 03:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
brochure it could be a brochure um but
 
03:52:12.429 --> 03:52:12.439 align:start position:0%
there are other options including uh the
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
idea of printing on receipts printing on
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
packaging bags Etc um and I think the
 
03:52:21.670 --> 03:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
the poster is good but the real value is
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
in that point of sale distribution
 
03:52:27.630 --> 03:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
system um because those that have this
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
issue of alcohol use disorder will sort
 
03:52:32.269 --> 03:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
of naturally receive this order Mo this
 
03:52:34.950 --> 03:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
information most frequently um and that
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
sort of is the point of it uh with any
 
03:52:40.510 --> 03:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
of these campaigns it takes repetition
 
03:52:43.269 --> 03:52:43.279 align:start position:0%
and many touch points in order for um
 
03:52:45.630 --> 03:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
that awareness to sort of uh reach the
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
point of action um it also might be seen
 
03:52:50.670 --> 03:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
you know if these receipts or or other
 
03:52:52.630 --> 03:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
materials are going home with people it
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
could be seen by their family members it
 
03:52:56.710 --> 03:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
could be an opportunity to start a
 
03:52:58.830 --> 03:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
discussion that that they probably
 
03:53:02.110 --> 03:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
already know might need to happen um and
 
03:53:04.149 --> 03:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
yeah there are there are um it does mean
 
03:53:06.670 --> 03:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
some of this might go to uh you know
 
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
commercial buyers or outof state buyers
 
03:53:10.389 --> 03:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
but I think the impact of that would be
 
03:53:12.830 --> 03:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
relatively small and and you know not
 
03:53:15.750 --> 03:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
wasted in that regard either so um just
 
03:53:19.389 --> 03:53:19.399 align:start position:0%
wrap up um I I I did talk to a number of
 
03:53:22.469 --> 03:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
groups within the state um in putting
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
this together um so this was developed
 
03:53:26.469 --> 03:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the Department of
 
03:53:28.110 --> 03:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
Services um I did speak to Patrick tuus
 
03:53:32.149 --> 03:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
at the governor's Commission in
 
03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
developing it I spoke with him this
 
03:53:35.070 --> 03:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
morning and he said that it's okay to
 
03:53:37.510 --> 03:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
mention that he's in support of this um
 
03:53:41.149 --> 03:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
new Futures uh sub a testimony before um
 
03:53:43.269 --> 03:53:43.279 align:start position:0%
or in support of it and again I did
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
speak with um a Moore from The Liquor
 
03:53:48.149 --> 03:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
Commission um initially in putting this
 
03:53:52.110 --> 03:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
together but I won't speak for him um uh
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
and it was noted that the Liquor
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
Commission does need legislative
 
03:53:58.110 --> 03:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
Authority in my understanding to to do
 
03:54:00.349 --> 03:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
things like this it's not naturally in
 
03:54:01.870 --> 03:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
their scope that they can just take it
 
03:54:04.750 --> 03:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
upon themselves uh to do this no matter
 
03:54:07.710 --> 03:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
whether they want to or not um it can be
 
03:54:10.750 --> 03:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
done uh at little cost um little
 
03:54:13.469 --> 03:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
intrusion to the existing process uh you
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
know and I tried to make it as flexible
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
as possible the resources already exist
 
03:54:19.630 --> 03:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
and since the state is the vendor I feel
 
03:54:22.349 --> 03:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
like it has both an opportunity and also
 
03:54:24.630 --> 03:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
a responsibility to to do things to
 
03:54:27.710 --> 03:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
limit the um Associated harm and
 
03:54:30.110 --> 03:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
Associated cost of of the liquor
 
03:54:32.469 --> 03:54:32.479 align:start position:0%
industry so that's my testimony be happy
 
03:54:33.630 --> 03:54:33.640 align:start position:0%
to take
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
questions okay well this is a
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we don't oh okay sorry
 
03:54:42.269 --> 03:54:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.429 --> 03:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
so when I look at it I there's some shs
 
03:54:50.229 --> 03:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
and Mays in here okay and and the sh
 
03:54:53.309 --> 03:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
looks like to me is that
 
03:54:56.550 --> 03:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
um it has to be on the electronic
 
03:55:01.110 --> 03:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
receipt or in some format yes no no not
 
03:55:03.189 --> 03:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
it shall be there
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
and it must be on the bags now there's
 
03:55:09.149 --> 03:55:09.159 align:start position:0%
no it's not it's not you know pick or
 
03:55:12.269 --> 03:55:12.279 align:start position:0%
choose what your it it I just shall be
 
03:55:13.429 --> 03:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
distributed to the community with each
 
03:55:15.630 --> 03:55:15.640 align:start position:0%
person made at the state as part of the
 
03:55:18.670 --> 03:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
printed electronic receipt for purchase
 
03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
comma on the
 
03:55:23.990 --> 03:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
bags or other packaging
 
03:55:27.950 --> 03:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
materials so when I maybe I buy too much
 
03:55:31.750 --> 03:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
but when I walk out I usually have a box
 
03:55:34.030 --> 03:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
a case so are they supposed to put that
 
03:55:36.990 --> 03:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
sticker on that case yeah sorry just to
 
03:55:39.070 --> 03:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
clarify the way this was sent in this
 
03:55:42.110 --> 03:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
this also just got drafted um it did say
 
03:55:44.229 --> 03:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
Andor between those Clauses that looks
 
03:55:46.110 --> 03:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
like that's not that's and or as a
 
03:55:48.149 --> 03:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
separate printed item yeah so it should
 
03:55:50.750 --> 03:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
have said printed in electronic uh or
 
03:55:53.349 --> 03:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
printed or electronic receipt Andor bags
 
03:55:55.469 --> 03:55:55.479 align:start position:0%
and other packaging Andor sep so you
 
03:55:57.550 --> 03:55:57.560 align:start position:0%
would be happy that if it just was on
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
the receipt
 
03:56:01.110 --> 03:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
correct okay that's that's something
 
03:56:06.189 --> 03:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
different here okay and then um um and
 
03:56:07.990 --> 03:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
on that receipt we're going to educate
 
03:56:10.510 --> 03:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
them about 9
 
03:56:13.830 --> 03:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
so it's two things uh first ideally
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
would be some prompts to make people
 
03:56:18.750 --> 03:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
think about whether they themselves have
 
03:56:20.670 --> 03:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol use disorder that's usually the
 
03:56:23.070 --> 03:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
first threshold to someone seeking
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
treatment is understanding or believing
 
03:56:27.070 --> 03:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
they have a problem and that's actually
 
03:56:28.910 --> 03:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
some of the value of this being
 
03:56:31.269 --> 03:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
repetitive um they're they
 
03:56:33.710 --> 03:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
standardized uh simple sets of questions
 
03:56:35.870 --> 03:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
or there's also materials I think
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps even that DHHS already has that
 
03:56:41.590 --> 03:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
that that served that function and and
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
then secondly if you think you have a
 
03:56:45.469 --> 03:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
problem here's the number to call right
 
03:56:47.030 --> 03:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
but this is all going to be on that
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
printed receipt yeah I've been to CVS
 
03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
yes I I know I understand the problem
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
with with it being on the receipt and
 
03:56:56.110 --> 03:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
and I agree people or or shouldn't say
 
03:56:57.830 --> 03:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
agree but I understand that people may
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
not read their receipts but I am
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
thinking if someone you know gets this
 
03:57:05.389 --> 03:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
repeatedly with each of their stops uh
 
03:57:07.710 --> 03:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
you know if they have a a a problem with
 
03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol they these would these would
 
03:57:12.030 --> 03:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
accumulate and hopefully at some point
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the information would sink in
 
03:57:15.950 --> 03:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is kind of how sort
 
03:57:17.189 --> 03:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
of I guess what it's called social
 
03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
marketing often often has to operate
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
okay and then the last thing is that
 
03:57:24.110 --> 03:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
they need to print posters have posters
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the stores yeah how many posters it
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
looks like it only has to be one it just
 
03:57:30.309 --> 03:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
says yeah as many as you'd like but one
 
03:57:33.550 --> 03:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
for sure one for sure okay questions
 
03:57:35.429 --> 03:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative wal
 
03:57:42.710 --> 03:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
may I ask a couple questions absolutely
 
03:57:45.389 --> 03:57:45.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you uh representative
 
03:57:48.030 --> 03:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
do you know uh if this has been done in
 
03:57:50.429 --> 03:57:50.439 align:start position:0%
any other
 
03:57:54.030 --> 03:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
state I well we are I don't know about
 
03:57:57.070 --> 03:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
other states that own their their liquor
 
03:57:58.710 --> 03:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
so I do not know of other states that
 
03:58:01.950 --> 03:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
own their liquor I know that the idea of
 
03:58:04.510 --> 03:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
promoting identification of alcohol use
 
03:58:07.870 --> 03:58:07.880 align:start position:0%
disorder and referral to uh treatment is
 
03:58:09.630 --> 03:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
is something that's being done in a lot
 
03:58:11.469 --> 03:58:11.479 align:start position:0%
of different ways but I I do not know if
 
03:58:13.550 --> 03:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
any other state is doing this or or has
 
03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
the mechanism for the
 
03:58:19.149 --> 03:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
question so do you know is there any
 
03:58:22.149 --> 03:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
data that has been collected by any of
 
03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
these groups whether it's new futures or
 
03:58:28.830 --> 03:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else that can
 
03:58:31.110 --> 03:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
substantiate people that have said oh
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
you know what I saw this on my receipt
 
03:58:39.389 --> 03:58:39.399 align:start position:0%
or I saw a poster and so it changed my
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
habits of buying alcohol I mean is there
 
03:58:44.590 --> 03:58:44.600 align:start position:0%
any kind of data that substantiates that
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
because there is still a cost to this to
 
03:58:49.349 --> 03:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
doing this and it seems that the cost
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
might be somewhat
 
03:58:51.000 --> 03:58:52.750 align:start position:0%
might be somewhat
nebulous

03:58:52.750 --> 03:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
nebulous
 
03:58:55.070 --> 03:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't seem like their firm
 
03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
cost and then and then if there's no
 
03:59:00.830 --> 03:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
advantage to doing this then we're going
 
03:59:03.070 --> 03:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
to keep spending money year after year
 
03:59:04.990 --> 03:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
after year I mean I I think I would like
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
to see something some type of
 
03:59:10.750 --> 03:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
measurement going on to see if some of
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
these whether they're automobile
 
03:59:15.750 --> 03:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
accidents or whatever goes down because
 
03:59:18.110 --> 03:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
this was instituted otherwise we're just
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
spending this year after year after year
 
03:59:23.070 --> 03:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
and it's like a feel-good thing but is
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
it actually doing any anything for
 
03:59:25.800 --> 03:59:28.349 align:start position:0%
it actually doing any anything for
anyone

03:59:28.349 --> 03:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
so you can ask you can ask a question so
 
03:59:32.790 --> 03:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
so let me answer that question then I
 
03:59:36.149 --> 03:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
I'll take the other one um so the there
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
are there are sets of um
 
03:59:42.670 --> 03:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
scientifically validated questions that
 
03:59:45.349 --> 03:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
um have been tested to help people get
 
03:59:47.630 --> 03:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
to the point that they recognize that
 
03:59:50.110 --> 03:59:50.120 align:start position:0%
they have alcohol use disorder I didn't
 
03:59:53.790 --> 03:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
specify you know that it has to be um a
 
03:59:55.590 --> 03:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
scientifically backed set of questions
 
03:59:57.550 --> 03:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
or anything in here but I would assume
 
03:59:59.389 --> 03:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
working with Health and Human Services
 
04:00:01.269 --> 04:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
they're they're well aware of that but
 
04:00:03.110 --> 04:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I can provide if you'd like some of
 
04:00:06.030 --> 04:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
the information that shows that these
 
04:00:08.550 --> 04:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
questions exist and have been scientific
 
04:00:11.149 --> 04:00:11.159 align:start position:0%
Al developed in order to help people get
 
04:00:13.469 --> 04:00:13.479 align:start position:0%
to a place where they would consider
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
using treatment so um whether or not and
 
04:00:18.990 --> 04:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
the thought of an evaluation did cross
 
04:00:21.389 --> 04:00:21.399 align:start position:0%
my mind when I was putting this together
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
um I decided it didn't really belong in
 
04:00:25.950 --> 04:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
here probably the best place to do that
 
04:00:29.189 --> 04:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
evaluation would be through the 988
 
04:00:31.469 --> 04:00:31.479 align:start position:0%
system or through the referral system to
 
04:00:33.510 --> 04:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
basically perhaps add a question have
 
04:00:35.070 --> 04:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
you seen that material did that have
 
04:00:37.469 --> 04:00:37.479 align:start position:0%
anything to do with your um but that I
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't think is in the purview of of this
 
04:00:41.229 --> 04:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
bill because it deals specifically with
 
04:00:43.469 --> 04:00:43.479 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission not with the not
 
04:00:45.070 --> 04:00:45.080 align:start position:0%
with the referral resource but I do
 
04:00:46.950 --> 04:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
agree to your point you know we don't
 
04:00:50.229 --> 04:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
effective okay
 
04:00:55.469 --> 04:00:55.479 align:start position:0%
repres thank you Mr
 
04:00:58.510 --> 04:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
chairman is it is it safe to
 
04:00:58.520 --> 04:01:00.550 align:start position:0%
chairman is it is it safe to
say

04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
that it'll cost a dollar per transaction
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
if you averaged it out because some will
 
04:01:11.229 --> 04:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
call the 988 line and take you know use
 
04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
some Services some will just throw the
 
04:01:15.630 --> 04:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
paper away a lot of people in between I
 
04:01:16.870 --> 04:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
mean is it safe to say that you think
 
04:01:20.309 --> 04:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
it's about a buck each time I I I just
 
04:01:22.149 --> 04:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not in a position to answer that I
 
04:01:24.349 --> 04:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
know if it's done through the receipts
 
04:01:26.070 --> 04:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
you know the cost to The Liquor
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
Commission hopefully would be fairly
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
minimal um the cost of the entire
 
04:01:34.110 --> 04:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
transaction if someone has a problem you
 
04:01:36.070 --> 04:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
know goes through because the 988 system
 
04:01:38.030 --> 04:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
already exists it's not being set up you
 
04:01:40.429 --> 04:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
know I mean the cost to actually get
 
04:01:42.910 --> 04:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
someone into treatment for alcohol is is
 
04:01:45.750 --> 04:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
is high but it it has you know those are
 
04:01:48.910 --> 04:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
also proven treatment modalities for for
 
04:01:52.149 --> 04:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
alcohol uh so you know this is a very
 
04:01:55.349 --> 04:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
small cost upfront to sort of hopefully
 
04:01:57.030 --> 04:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
make use of systems that have already
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
been developed that have larger costs
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
associated but are basically goals of
 
04:02:05.349 --> 04:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
the state in my understanding so 10 or I
 
04:02:08.670 --> 04:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
mean 10 or 12 million doar in
 
04:02:10.790 --> 04:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
referrals and expenses and printing I
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
mean as written it's multiple things but
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
you you'd be fine I think you mentioned
 
04:02:19.149 --> 04:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
changing it to only printing a alcohol
 
04:02:21.630 --> 04:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
is bad I mean sorry to over simplify but
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
on on the receipt a small message on the
 
04:02:26.149 --> 04:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
receipt yeah so the the amendment
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
basically says it's at the liquor
 
04:02:30.429 --> 04:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
commission's option how they distribute
 
04:02:33.550 --> 04:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
that information either printed or
 
04:02:36.750 --> 04:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
electronic um receipt or on packaging
 
04:02:41.550 --> 04:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
materials or on um or on uh a separate a
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
separate item but yeah I I have no
 
04:02:46.149 --> 04:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
ability to to comment on the associate
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
question would be is U would you be
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
happy if all they did other than the
 
04:02:55.830 --> 04:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
posters if all they did is printed on
 
04:02:58.229 --> 04:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
the receipt yeah that was specific
 
04:03:00.389 --> 04:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with the groups I
 
04:03:02.710 --> 04:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned devel the least least
 
04:03:04.910 --> 04:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
expensive least because to print out
 
04:03:06.790 --> 04:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
little cards because like you say the
 
04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
the going on the packages and bags and
 
04:03:11.950 --> 04:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
that would be that would open up a whole
 
04:03:14.189 --> 04:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
can of worms you know in terms of you
 
04:03:17.070 --> 04:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
know some people buy uh especially at
 
04:03:19.630 --> 04:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
holiday they have things come in a box
 
04:03:21.910 --> 04:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
is that is going to be on that box so
 
04:03:24.670 --> 04:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
that would mean they would E A have the
 
04:03:26.309 --> 04:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
pre have a sticker on there which of
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
course they won't want to do that
 
04:03:29.309 --> 04:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
because that would kind of ruin the box
 
04:03:31.349 --> 04:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
for Christmas but but the more
 
04:03:33.149 --> 04:03:33.159 align:start position:0%
importantly is is to have that piece of
 
04:03:36.189 --> 04:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
paper if they can avoid having to worry
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
about giving any piece of paper that the
 
04:03:40.830 --> 04:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
computer would automatically generate
 
04:03:40.840 --> 04:03:41.950 align:start position:0%
computer would automatically generate
this

04:03:41.950 --> 04:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:03:44.590 --> 04:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
message then you would be happy yeah and
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
and I will reiterate that what I said
 
04:03:47.910 --> 04:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
during the testimony that that the
 
04:03:50.309 --> 04:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
estimates of the direct cost to this the
 
04:03:53.790 --> 04:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
state through all of the um I'm not
 
04:03:55.830 --> 04:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
worried about that 988 is exists you
 
04:03:58.269 --> 04:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
know we we if anything you can do to
 
04:04:00.750 --> 04:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
drive more people to 988 that would be a
 
04:04:02.309 --> 04:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
good thing right right and I was just
 
04:04:04.110 --> 04:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
weighing it against the sort of estimate
 
04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
of $832 million a year in other costs um
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
that that are associated which is in
 
04:04:12.349 --> 04:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
excessive I think the total liquor sales
 
04:04:14.670 --> 04:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
if we just cut this thing down to a very
 
04:04:18.389 --> 04:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
simple thing printed on the receipt yep
 
04:04:20.189 --> 04:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
I I would be very happy we are not doing
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
that today you're not worrying about all
 
04:04:26.189 --> 04:04:26.199 align:start position:0%
the other all the other places okay now
 
04:04:27.710 --> 04:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
representative wals you have a response
 
04:04:27.720 --> 04:04:28.630 align:start position:0%
representative wals you have a response
to

04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:04:32.469 --> 04:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
that somewhat I just wanted to add that
 
04:04:35.189 --> 04:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
my quick lookup shows there are seven
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
states that own uh all the liquor stores
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
so it may behoove you to find out if any
 
04:04:45.309 --> 04:04:45.319 align:start position:0%
of the others do anything like this so
 
04:04:48.870 --> 04:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's Alabama Idaho New Hampshire North
 
04:04:52.910 --> 04:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
Carolina Pennsylvania Utah and Virginia
 
04:04:55.110 --> 04:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I did not I did not do that that
 
04:04:56.710 --> 04:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
inquiry as I thought there was I thought
 
04:04:59.870 --> 04:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
there was more like 16 or 17 states
 
04:05:02.189 --> 04:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
there are there are follow there are
 
04:05:04.510 --> 04:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
other more that states control
 
04:05:07.630 --> 04:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
distribution same thing yeah okay yeah
 
04:05:08.910 --> 04:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't saying that I know that
 
04:05:10.590 --> 04:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
they don't I'm just saying I didn't look
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
that they did yeah representative pusc
 
04:05:16.830 --> 04:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um let me
 
04:05:18.030 --> 04:05:18.040 align:start position:0%
preface my
 
04:05:20.910 --> 04:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
remarks uh by saying that I agree with
 
04:05:20.920 --> 04:05:21.990 align:start position:0%
remarks uh by saying that I agree with
new

04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
Futures that is a practical
 
04:05:26.229 --> 04:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
compassionate perspective and the bill
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
is good
 
04:05:27.720 --> 04:05:29.469 align:start position:0%
is good
policy

04:05:29.469 --> 04:05:29.479 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:05:34.630 --> 04:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
but I see this as the nose Under the
 
04:05:39.070 --> 04:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
Tent that this will become a State
 
04:05:42.670 --> 04:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
program and the quarter to half million
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
dollars will rise
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
commensurately uh there I know new
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
Futures has programs where they have
 
04:05:55.469 --> 04:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
these types of things and I'm quite sure
 
04:05:56.950 --> 04:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission would make
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
room in the facilities for any any
 
04:06:04.349 --> 04:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
entity that would want
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
to uh agree with new Futures and put in
 
04:06:10.199 --> 04:06:12.510 align:start position:0%
to uh agree with new Futures and put in
anti-alcohol

04:06:12.510 --> 04:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
anti-alcohol
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
information so uh although I love it I
 
04:06:19.870 --> 04:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
have to vote against
 
04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
it okay uh was that a question or just a
 
04:06:26.229 --> 04:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
this is a subcommittee so you're he's
 
04:06:27.670 --> 04:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
entitled to his
 
04:06:31.030 --> 04:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
opinion was not a question I I will say
 
04:06:33.550 --> 04:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's not about alcohol or discouraging
 
04:06:35.229 --> 04:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
alcohol use it's really about treatment
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
and referral okay represent Ammon and
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
then repres I'm not on the subcommittee
 
04:06:42.910 --> 04:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
but I did have a thought to throw out um
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
we've seen bills in the past that want
 
04:06:48.590 --> 04:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
to ban the printing of receipts
 
04:06:51.110 --> 04:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
altogether unless you ask for it so
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
we'll just have to keep in mind if those
 
04:06:54.670 --> 04:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
bills come back that I think that would
 
04:06:57.910 --> 04:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
impact the this uh this idea okay and it
 
04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
does specify it can be printed or
 
04:06:59.600 --> 04:07:01.389 align:start position:0%
does specify it can be printed or
electronic

04:07:01.389 --> 04:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
receipt that's great but we don't have
 
04:07:09.070 --> 04:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
that yet okay represent yeah you take it
 
04:07:10.870 --> 04:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
I think if they if it's printed on the
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
receipt I think that's fair because I
 
04:07:14.429 --> 04:07:14.439 align:start position:0%
think they can add you know probably I'm
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
not sure but with very little money they
 
04:07:19.710 --> 04:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
can add another line item or another you
 
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
know phrase or a couple words on the
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
receipt and the posters um um can be
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
probably produced by new Futures so that
 
04:07:31.790 --> 04:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you know that wouldn't uh cost
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission you know any money
 
04:07:37.109 --> 04:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
but if you have it on the receipts you
 
04:07:41.070 --> 04:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
can't have have the um um person running
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
the cash register um asking if you want
 
04:07:45.750 --> 04:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
the receipt or not they should just give
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
them the receipt anyway instead of
 
04:07:50.670 --> 04:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
asking because the the receipt is
 
04:07:53.030 --> 04:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
printed anyway so put it in the bag
 
04:07:55.229 --> 04:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
don't even ask do you want the receipt
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
or not because every time I go do you
 
04:07:59.950 --> 04:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
want the receipt or most of the time I
 
04:08:01.590 --> 04:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
just say no I don't need the receipt so
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
I think on the receipt I think that
 
04:08:06.030 --> 04:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
might be doable uh and maybe new Futures
 
04:08:08.469 --> 04:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
can you know produce a poster in
 
04:08:10.149 --> 04:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the liquid commission
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
to make that work one per store would
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
you believe yes okay representative Sol
 
04:08:20.229 --> 04:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just curious if it's where this
 
04:08:22.750 --> 04:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
um these expenditures from the fiscal no
 
04:08:25.429 --> 04:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
come from just because if it's going to
 
04:08:28.510 --> 04:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
be on a receipt it's hard to IM
 
04:08:31.389 --> 04:08:31.399 align:start position:0%
imagine maybe a quarter of an inch more
 
04:08:32.990 --> 04:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
paper half inch more paper is going to
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
add up to a half million dollars um do
 
04:08:37.830 --> 04:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
we know where that came from or yeah
 
04:08:40.590 --> 04:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
well Aiden's here and it's his fault
 
04:08:43.830 --> 04:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
anden and I believe he was looking at
 
04:08:45.389 --> 04:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
the brochures he was looking at the
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
original Bill the brochures and the
 
04:08:50.510 --> 04:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
handouts and all the printing of all the
 
04:08:51.990 --> 04:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
and then he was looking at the amount of
 
04:08:54.670 --> 04:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
transactions and numerically came up
 
04:08:56.910 --> 04:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
with this outrageous number due to there
 
04:08:59.710 --> 04:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
are so many transactions that look store
 
04:09:02.149 --> 04:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
which we would be handing them that
 
04:09:04.070 --> 04:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
brochure that piece of paper that makes
 
04:09:06.109 --> 04:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
sense so yeah I think if if we're
 
04:09:07.870 --> 04:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
talking about just the receipt thing
 
04:09:10.389 --> 04:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
this isn't particularly concerning from
 
04:09:12.510 --> 04:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
a cost perspective is my guess correct
 
04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong or a different opinion
 
04:09:17.229 --> 04:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
and I mean do I think this is going to
 
04:09:20.149 --> 04:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
have a huge impact my gut says no but I
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
can't imagine it's going to be a
 
04:09:25.229 --> 04:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
particularly like negative impact or big
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
cost so I mean I don't I don't see a
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
particularly offensive thing about this
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
idea just sort of my
 
04:09:36.149 --> 04:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
take yes represent pelli just a comment
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
well I think this is well-intentioned
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
there's alcohol there's gambling there's
 
04:09:45.670 --> 04:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
drug abuse these are all very worthwhile
 
04:09:47.429 --> 04:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
areas where we want to get the message
 
04:09:49.630 --> 04:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
out but I'm going to ask you I'm going
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
to charge you with thinking differently
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
about how we communicate to probably the
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
target audience that you're looking to
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh make sure they understand this
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
information is available and a receipt
 
04:10:03.790 --> 04:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
is not going to do it the Liquor
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
Commission does a phenomenal job in
 
04:10:06.439 --> 04:10:08.109 align:start position:0%
Commission does a phenomenal job in
marketing

04:10:08.109 --> 04:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh please ask them how they think they
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
would be able to better communicate
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
through public service announcements
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
social media different methods of
 
04:10:19.550 --> 04:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
communication that would really get the
 
04:10:22.389 --> 04:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
message out would probably be negligible
 
04:10:25.109 --> 04:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
in cost and might be more effective than
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
a receipt that probably no one would
 
04:10:30.389 --> 04:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
look at so I'm going to ask you to
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
please work with the marketing
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
department of the uh State Liquor Store
 
04:10:37.870 --> 04:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
that does a very good job in uh getting
 
04:10:40.389 --> 04:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
their message out and see what other
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
types of communication that would be
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
zero cost and be more effective okay
 
04:10:48.389 --> 04:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
yeah just just to Circle back on on that
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the the state already puts
 
04:10:53.109 --> 04:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
resources into promoting 988 through
 
04:10:55.510 --> 04:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
other mechanisms you know and as I said
 
04:10:57.309 --> 04:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
those are not targeted as this would be
 
04:11:00.189 --> 04:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
those are broad-based um you know and
 
04:11:02.830 --> 04:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
and uh there are there are resources put
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
behind that um I you know I would love
 
04:11:07.670 --> 04:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
to work with them on this but that's
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be my role my role
 
04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
is to sort of introduce the legislation
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
um and I did sort of explicitly leave it
 
04:11:16.389 --> 04:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the Liquor Commission it
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
says working with the Department of
 
04:11:19.870 --> 04:11:19.880 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to figure out
 
04:11:22.750 --> 04:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
how best to communicate that but um I
 
04:11:25.830 --> 04:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
think the the the key was some way that
 
04:11:27.550 --> 04:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
each time someone comes in because the
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
people who come in the most are the
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
people with the most need for this
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
information um this would almost
 
04:11:38.189 --> 04:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
naturally target the population yeah
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to move this along a
 
04:11:41.950 --> 04:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
little bit um because we've kind of
 
04:11:43.790 --> 04:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
narrow it
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
down and uh as much as I think new
 
04:11:49.109 --> 04:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
Futures would love to to distribute
 
04:11:52.830 --> 04:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
posters but we were not that's that's no
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:00.990 --> 04:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
there already has posters
 
04:12:04.349 --> 04:12:04.359 align:start position:0%
thereon there are posters Flyers free of
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
charge to the commission or anyone else
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
until they have them now and they have
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
them now they have them now okay so so
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
that is only as good as that anybody
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
reads those posters having said that um
 
04:12:22.030 --> 04:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
I I would say if we were to narrow this
 
04:12:27.469 --> 04:12:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:30.189 --> 04:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
receipts because no human has to be
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
worried about it right Aiden
 
04:12:36.910 --> 04:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
would good come would excuse me let
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
Aiden L thank you very much for your
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
speaking L thank thank you for allowing
 
04:12:50.830 --> 04:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:54.149 --> 04:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chairman I think it it might be
 
04:12:55.550 --> 04:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate where there are so many
 
04:12:59.710 --> 04:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
different moving Parts in this bill that
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
um maybe if you if the committee were to
 
04:13:04.349 --> 04:13:04.359 align:start position:0%
give us time to go back to the
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
commission talk to the chairman uh about
 
04:13:10.710 --> 04:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
what the capacity is I I I don't know
 
04:13:13.550 --> 04:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what it would take no I I'm not
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
asking you to commit for the yeah the
 
04:13:19.149 --> 04:13:19.159 align:start position:0%
commission I'm just I'm proposing now a
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
concept that we narrow this bill to
 
04:13:25.109 --> 04:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
just the
 
04:13:28.109 --> 04:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
receipts and just that we really want to
 
04:13:30.670 --> 04:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
do is educate people about
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
988 I am always amazed I mean we had a
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
member of the committee she didn't even
 
04:13:37.870 --> 04:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
know 98
 
04:13:40.510 --> 04:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
existed I think that if we narrowed it
 
04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
to just 988 I think this would be a
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
perfect amendment to add to our
 
04:13:48.030 --> 04:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill that cannabis bill which
 
04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
also has could have
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
state stores and we wouldn't want it to
 
04:13:56.830 --> 04:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
be printed on their receipts too that
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
988 is nothing else if we educate people
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
that 988 exists that could be a good
 
04:14:07.830 --> 04:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
thing I'm now so I'm gonna thank you
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
Aiden so I'm now going to bring it to
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee how do people feel
 
04:14:14.040 --> 04:14:15.109 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee how do people feel
about

04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:14:17.870 --> 04:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
that compromise a simple amendment to
 
04:14:21.510 --> 04:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it's good just like
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
one you're in well just one line or
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
something it'll be a minimum line it
 
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
just you know but it'll be you know
 
04:14:29.309 --> 04:14:29.319 align:start position:0%
something to say that you know that that
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know about 988 and that it exists
 
04:14:35.910 --> 04:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
and and feel free to call it when you're
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
maybe think thinking that maybe you
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
really should have it if you are
 
04:14:40.239 --> 04:14:42.070 align:start position:0%
really should have it if you are
drinking

04:14:42.070 --> 04:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
drinking
 
04:14:42.080 --> 04:14:43.790 align:start position:0%
drinking
or

04:14:43.790 --> 04:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:14:46.469 --> 04:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
smoking we can't go there yet or buying
 
04:14:49.590 --> 04:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
lottery tickets or Lottery T lottery
 
04:14:50.830 --> 04:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
tickets we
 
04:14:52.750 --> 04:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
can I don't think you get a receipt with
 
04:14:56.189 --> 04:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
a lottery it's free of charge uh
 
04:14:59.109 --> 04:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
what that they're already posters now
 
04:15:00.670 --> 04:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
that are already being distributed
 
04:15:02.349 --> 04:15:02.359 align:start position:0%
they're already there in the store
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're in the liquor stores no oh you
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
said there was no they're available
 
04:15:10.950 --> 04:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay sure come on so what you're looking
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
at Mr chairman is taking the amendment
 
04:15:13.590 --> 04:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
that you have and taking everything
 
04:15:15.550 --> 04:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
after electronic receipt for the
 
04:15:17.149 --> 04:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
purchase period and everything else is
 
04:15:20.830 --> 04:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
struck yeah pretty much
 
04:15:23.750 --> 04:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
y good afternoon Kei FR from um new
 
04:15:26.189 --> 04:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
Futures this was in my testimony so I
 
04:15:28.229 --> 04:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify it and um Jenny O
 
04:15:29.389 --> 04:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
Higgins from the Department of Health
 
04:15:31.510 --> 04:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
and Human Services was going to so oh
 
04:15:33.030 --> 04:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry was going to be here today
 
04:15:34.389 --> 04:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
Jenny O Higgins from the Department of
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Service is going to be
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
here today there is a campaign out that
 
04:15:41.429 --> 04:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
has been um Department of Health and
 
04:15:43.269 --> 04:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
Human Services has spent a lot of money
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
on strong as Granite campaign that the
 
04:15:48.469 --> 04:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
idea is a full immersion of information
 
04:15:51.429 --> 04:15:51.439 align:start position:0%
about 988 and that information through
 
04:15:54.670 --> 04:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
posters social media so the what I was
 
04:15:57.389 --> 04:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
trying to say and had in my um testimony
 
04:16:00.109 --> 04:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
is you could get multiple posters to
 
04:16:02.349 --> 04:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
distribute to The Liquor Commission free
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
of charge um they are available
 
04:16:07.710 --> 04:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
completely already
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
think from the discussion if if they
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
were mandated to do it be a lot easier I
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
was just talking to Aiden if it's
 
04:16:15.790 --> 04:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
something that they'd be willing to do
 
04:16:18.349 --> 04:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
that's even easier I'm telling you they
 
04:16:20.670 --> 04:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
are free of charge there is no cost
 
04:16:22.349 --> 04:16:22.359 align:start position:0%
anybody can order
 
04:16:26.349 --> 04:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
Flyers uh wallet things anything so the
 
04:16:28.510 --> 04:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
information is there and it is exactly
 
04:16:30.550 --> 04:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
as you said chairman it's information
 
04:16:33.750 --> 04:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
how to contact it's 988 very simple very
 
04:16:37.950 --> 04:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
simple okay so but I I'm sure
 
04:16:39.469 --> 04:16:39.479 align:start position:0%
and now I'm gonna now I'm going to look
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
mark that that the Liquor Commission be
 
04:16:50.030 --> 04:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
more than welcome to accept these signs
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
and get them but I know you're
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement so there's no one here
 
04:16:56.590 --> 04:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
actually from the retail side of the
 
04:16:58.990 --> 04:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
division to carry on this uh that we'd
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.800 --> 04:17:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
poster

04:17:10.830 --> 04:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
yeah make that happen Okay I hate to
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
clutter the statute with that but any
 
04:17:20.189 --> 04:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
okay repesent pus thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
I would you believe um would you believe
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
that print stock roles can come
 
04:17:30.429 --> 04:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
pre-printed on the back in red with all
 
04:17:32.510 --> 04:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
these messages and we don't have to
 
04:17:35.790 --> 04:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
print them on our uh
 
04:17:38.189 --> 04:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
terminals unfortunately that that is
 
04:17:39.710 --> 04:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
true they could get those pre-printed
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
rules but yes thank you I'm sure but
 
04:17:45.149 --> 04:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
right now we're just trying to get the
 
04:17:48.109 --> 04:17:48.119 align:start position:0%
computer to operate on the front side
 
04:17:49.229 --> 04:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
get that
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
right okay so that would be Amendment
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
and we'll take up this uh Bill have this
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
in a week we'll have an amendment drawn
 
04:17:57.760 --> 04:17:59.070 align:start position:0%
in a week we'll have an amendment drawn
up

04:17:59.070 --> 04:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:18:03.870 --> 04:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
and all right all right that's good yep
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right last but not least
 
04:18:13.990 --> 04:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:14.000 --> 04:18:15.870 align:start position:0%
 
everyone

04:18:15.870 --> 04:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:18:20.149 --> 04:18:20.159 align:start position:0%

04:18:22.910 --> 04:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
Knowle the amendment but I got it
 
04:18:22.920 --> 04:18:24.510 align:start position:0%
Knowle the amendment but I got it
yesterday

04:18:24.510 --> 04:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
two yeah it's a different yeah okay be
 
04:18:30.389 --> 04:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
two but technically it's the latest one
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
what you want me to do oh I won't worry
 
04:18:35.349 --> 04:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
about it okay okay thank you you have
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody cop okay go ahead
 
04:18:40.269 --> 04:18:40.279 align:start position:0%
and just trip just Tri it I I hate to
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
Hate to kill all those trees and not use
 
04:18:45.550 --> 04:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
it okay all right so what's happening
 
04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
right now is um in front of everybody is
 
04:18:51.429 --> 04:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
an amendment um that
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
theoretically uh was drawn from the
 
04:18:58.950 --> 04:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
notes of the Cannabis
 
04:19:02.950 --> 04:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
commission all right now I assume that
 
04:19:05.070 --> 04:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
very few of us in this room who actually
 
04:19:07.710 --> 04:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
read this cover to cover and absorbed
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
all when did it come out five minutes
 
04:19:13.229 --> 04:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
ago exactly exactly exactly all right so
 
04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think we should discuss it
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't that's can I finish my
 
04:19:20.429 --> 04:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
sentence thank
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
you so what I would like to have a
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on now is in terms of what we
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
do for next
 
04:19:32.030 --> 04:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
week okay okay and the question is is
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
the committee um willing to look at an
 
04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:39.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that is
 
04:19:41.870 --> 04:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically um what the Senate has
 
04:19:44.269 --> 04:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
verbally said to me that they are
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
interested in in passing
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
or deep sck it don't care pass the bill
 
04:19:54.030 --> 04:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
in its current
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
form and see what happens when it gets
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
to the Senate so that's what we're going
 
04:20:01.590 --> 04:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
to discuss right
 
04:20:07.309 --> 04:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
now so evidently uh representative buo
 
04:20:09.830 --> 04:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
you have strong opinions about what you
 
04:20:11.070 --> 04:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
think we should do can we have the
 
04:20:12.269 --> 04:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor come
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
up the chair and talk about what we're
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
talking about right now well this is
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
really a subcommittee decision about
 
04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
whether we want whether I mean I think
 
04:20:22.389 --> 04:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
we all know what the sponsor wants she
 
04:20:25.269 --> 04:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
wants her bill right but everybody else
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
oh oh oh you might want to speak towards
 
04:20:28.750 --> 04:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment I'm hijacking her bill so
 
04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
she needs to speak on the bill that's a
 
04:20:34.990 --> 04:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
way to look at it hijacking
 
04:20:37.950 --> 04:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
okay she asked me to do a non- gerain
 
04:20:40.109 --> 04:20:40.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment hearing which I'm agreeing to
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
do so I guess what would you rather us
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
do would you rather us not have that
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
non-domain hearing and just go ahead and
 
04:20:52.710 --> 04:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
discuss your bill or are you interested
 
04:20:55.950 --> 04:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
in passing or just uh in really passing
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
the ultimately we don't want to waste
 
04:21:00.550 --> 04:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
our time uh passing this amendment which
 
04:21:02.429 --> 04:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
is based on upon the
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
commission's uh report or actually not a
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
report because didn't put I guess they
 
04:21:09.469 --> 04:21:09.479 align:start position:0%
did a report but what the commission's
 
04:21:12.349 --> 04:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
work was um so the reason why we put
 
04:21:13.990 --> 04:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
this bill together in the first place is
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
because we weren't sure what was going
 
04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
to happen in the commission we knew that
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
legalization is a topic that's very
 
04:21:21.269 --> 04:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
important to the people of New Hampshire
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to make sure that we had a
 
04:21:24.910 --> 04:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
path forward that had already reached
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
some agreement where we could look and
 
04:21:28.870 --> 04:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
see what the possibilities would be um
 
04:21:30.149 --> 04:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
listening to the commission and
 
04:21:32.229 --> 04:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
everything that happened there's I know
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of interest in having a
 
04:21:35.950 --> 04:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
state-run model but there are multiple
 
04:21:37.870 --> 04:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
ways to have have a state run model and
 
04:21:39.229 --> 04:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
I think that we can come to something
 
04:21:42.070 --> 04:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
that meets most people's needs while
 
04:21:43.630 --> 04:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're minimizing risk
 
04:21:45.910 --> 04:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
to the state so one of the big issues we
 
04:21:48.790 --> 04:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
have to face is the fact that uh you
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
know you probably remember McDonald's
 
04:21:54.030 --> 04:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
and the hot coffee so McDonald's had
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
their franchisee who served coffee that
 
04:21:58.229 --> 04:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
was very hot it spilled on somebody's
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
lap it burned them and they sued not
 
04:22:03.109 --> 04:22:03.119 align:start position:0%
just that franchisee but the franchisor
 
04:22:06.030 --> 04:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
McDonald's corporate so we should really
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
be careful as we draft our state run
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
model to make sure that we don't turn
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a state into McDonald's
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
corporate and make us liable not for any
 
04:22:18.269 --> 04:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
just problems with the Cannabis but if
 
04:22:20.309 --> 04:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
somebody slips on ice on their way in I
 
04:22:22.149 --> 04:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
know that there's different limitations
 
04:22:24.269 --> 04:22:24.279 align:start position:0%
and especially if it is a state store
 
04:22:26.349 --> 04:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
there may be a little bit of wiggle room
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
but we want to make sure that we're not
 
04:22:29.469 --> 04:22:29.479 align:start position:0%
creating a franchise underneath the
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
state so there's three tests that are
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
used in law to determine if it's a
 
04:22:36.389 --> 04:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
franchise the first is using a trademark
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
I think just about every process that
 
04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
we've had has some State recognizable
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
symbol for cannabis the fact that this
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
is not federally allowed and that each
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
state has their own market and it makes
 
04:22:49.469 --> 04:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
sense that each state sort of has some
 
04:22:51.109 --> 04:22:51.119 align:start position:0%
marking to that it's New Hampshire
 
04:22:52.990 --> 04:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis or California Cannabis or
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts cannabis makes sense and
 
04:22:57.830 --> 04:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
Most states follow that so anything that
 
04:22:58.990 --> 04:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
would be sold in the state of New
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would essentially be under New
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire trademark so we're already
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
meeting step number one step number
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
three is is that the franchisee pays the
 
04:23:09.870 --> 04:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
franchise or a certain amount of money
 
04:23:12.309 --> 04:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
to do that that can either be in a fixed
 
04:23:13.790 --> 04:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
amount that they're paying to the state
 
04:23:16.389 --> 04:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
or a certain amount on sales so the fact
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to look at either
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
rooms meals cannabis going to look at an
 
04:23:21.910 --> 04:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
excise going to just look at at
 
04:23:23.830 --> 04:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
licensing fees based on the volume that
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
come through the door anything we do
 
04:23:27.469 --> 04:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
that makes it so the state of New
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can benefit from the money
 
04:23:30.429 --> 04:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
that's already being spent out of state
 
04:23:33.630 --> 04:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
on this product is going to meet section
 
04:23:36.349 --> 04:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
number three so we're already going to
 
04:23:38.070 --> 04:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
meet one and three we need to look at
 
04:23:40.950 --> 04:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
section two section two talks about how
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
much operational control the franchisor
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
has over the
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
franchise so if you're going to have
 
04:23:47.550 --> 04:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
something where everybody's driving up
 
04:23:49.950 --> 04:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
to a McDonald's or a Chick-fil-A or
 
04:23:52.109 --> 04:23:52.119 align:start position:0%
whatever the standard look is that's
 
04:23:53.910 --> 04:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
giving a lot of operational control to
 
04:23:56.429 --> 04:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
the state um even if you talk about the
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
way that they do marketing and have the
 
04:24:00.510 --> 04:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
marketing done by the fr the state that
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
is a franchise or
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
relationship but if it's only limited to
 
04:24:07.070 --> 04:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
the health and safety then that that
 
04:24:09.469 --> 04:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't create that substantial control
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's clearly the role of the state and
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
that would not make us a
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
franchisor my Big Goal here is to make
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
sure that we meet the people's needs
 
04:24:21.149 --> 04:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
which is to legalize cannabis but also
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that we aren't potentially
 
04:24:24.469 --> 04:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
putting you know State records State
 
04:24:27.429 --> 04:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
funds state assets at risk because we
 
04:24:29.950 --> 04:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
inadvertently set up a system where the
 
04:24:31.469 --> 04:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
state's going to be on the hook so I
 
04:24:33.109 --> 04:24:33.119 align:start position:0%
would like to work with you to find a
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
way to to sort of weave that that weave
 
04:24:39.389 --> 04:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
that path square that Circle and find a
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
way where we can have a state-run model
 
04:24:43.149 --> 04:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
that meets all of our needs while
 
04:24:45.790 --> 04:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
drisking this by taking away this risk
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
that the state is going to be sued so I
 
04:24:49.990 --> 04:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
want to work towards it it's not going
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
to be my bill it's not going to be your
 
04:24:54.070 --> 04:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill but let's work towards towards
 
04:24:56.309 --> 04:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
figuring out where the appropriate line
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
is because quite frankly if my name is
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
on a bill where we're talking about
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
being a franchisor and the state's going
 
04:25:04.429 --> 04:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
to be going to be sued I'm going to have
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
to speak against that because
 
04:25:08.429 --> 04:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
how do I know that I'm not going to be
 
04:25:09.750 --> 04:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
one of the first people named in the
 
04:25:12.070 --> 04:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuit when I P if I brought this bill
 
04:25:14.910 --> 04:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
forward that makes the state liable you
 
04:25:16.750 --> 04:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
know and and I see I see that you're
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
looking that I might be searching for
 
04:25:20.229 --> 04:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
problems and my job on Wall Street was
 
04:25:22.590 --> 04:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
to look at risks for companies for
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
Industries for devices and surgeries and
 
04:25:27.149 --> 04:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
see how companies could mitigate those
 
04:25:29.830 --> 04:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
risks to be a good investment so my job
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
was to be paranoid and they paid me
 
04:25:33.710 --> 04:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
really well for it and also not to be
 
04:25:35.790 --> 04:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
overly paranoid because I'd lose money
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
and then people would punish me so to
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
walk that line of appropriate paranoia
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
and I think that we need to make sure
 
04:25:43.790 --> 04:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
that we do not check box number two and
 
04:25:45.790 --> 04:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
we limit it to just health and safety
 
04:25:48.950 --> 04:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
aspects which really are substantial so
 
04:25:51.750 --> 04:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be true of our liquor stores
 
04:25:54.269 --> 04:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
so with our Liquor Stores um there
 
04:25:56.349 --> 04:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
you're you have the stores that are
 
04:25:58.189 --> 04:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
there you have that branding on the
 
04:26:01.349 --> 04:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
outside right um but it is but it's not
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
a separate organization so if you had a
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
statun cannabis store where the run
 
04:26:09.469 --> 04:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
store was plant touching then it would
 
04:26:11.389 --> 04:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
all be within that but I know that
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's other risks that's why 1598
 
04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
didn't move forward because there was
 
04:26:17.910 --> 04:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
the concern about having actual state
 
04:26:20.109 --> 04:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
employees growing the cand no State
 
04:26:22.269 --> 04:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
employ no state employees involved here
 
04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
but there are at the liquor store that's
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
why it's not a franchise or and
 
04:26:28.750 --> 04:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
franchisee it's all just one Corporation
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay so let me just walk you through
 
04:26:33.149 --> 04:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
this so you understand how we got here
 
04:26:38.550 --> 04:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
okay and that was the Governor said that
 
04:26:42.269 --> 04:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
um he felt more comfortable if we did
 
04:26:44.469 --> 04:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
something modeled off of our state
 
04:26:44.479 --> 04:26:45.349 align:start position:0%
something modeled off of our state
lurker

04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
lurker
 
04:26:47.910 --> 04:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
stores and why did he say that well
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
because there are less stores we control
 
04:26:53.469 --> 04:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
the marketing control the
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
advertising we don't have which I have
 
04:26:58.990 --> 04:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
in my neighborhood of Massachusetts the
 
04:27:03.269 --> 04:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
bud Barn that have a uniform name on the
 
04:27:07.389 --> 04:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
outside that's where the where he he was
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
going with
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
it the problem with us with our state
 
04:27:14.750 --> 04:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
liquor stores is that we built those
 
04:27:18.830 --> 04:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
stores we paid for them millions and
 
04:27:21.510 --> 04:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to build that
 
04:27:21.520 --> 04:27:24.469 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to build that
out

04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
so thinking Minds put their heads
 
04:27:29.550 --> 04:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
together and say how do we avoid that
 
04:27:32.910 --> 04:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
problem how do we get these things
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
created still be State managed State
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
marketing state so that all the receipts
 
04:27:41.309 --> 04:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
are going to look the same and maybe
 
04:27:44.229 --> 04:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
have 988 written on the bottom of them
 
04:27:47.229 --> 04:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
okay how are we going to do that without
 
04:27:48.950 --> 04:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
having to pay millions and millions of
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
dollars to build out and that's how the
 
04:27:54.990 --> 04:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
franchise model was invented franchise
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
model I and I have to said I'm not an
 
04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
expert I'm not a lawyer even though I've
 
04:28:01.349 --> 04:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
been accused of that many times being on
 
04:28:04.030 --> 04:28:04.040 align:start position:0%
this committee but I want to assure you
 
04:28:06.990 --> 04:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
that franchise liability an extent of
 
04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
liability in terms of whether it was the
 
04:28:12.870 --> 04:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
franchise or the mother entity that owns
 
04:28:15.309 --> 04:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
the franchise in terms of liabilities
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
are well sorted out huge amount of case
 
04:28:21.389 --> 04:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
law and sving that issue so it's really
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
not a problem the point being is do you
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
want the marijuana legislation to pass
 
04:28:32.990 --> 04:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
this year I want to have agency stores
 
04:28:35.070 --> 04:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
by having an agency store model instead
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
of a state-run store model we have a
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
framework that already exists within the
 
04:28:41.229 --> 04:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
statutes that is within our Liquor
 
04:28:43.229 --> 04:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
Commission that is within the process I
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
recognize that currently those are only
 
04:28:47.510 --> 04:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
in rural areas but by doing that it
 
04:28:51.510 --> 04:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
would allow us to have a path to have a
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
guiding hand without controlling the
 
04:28:56.670 --> 04:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
day-to-day operations because within the
 
04:28:58.469 --> 04:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
health and safety that is that is the
 
04:29:00.389 --> 04:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
role of government to be involved in the
 
04:29:02.469 --> 04:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
health and safety but the marketing is
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
where you start Crossing into that line
 
04:29:06.309 --> 04:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
there's you know there's also an issue
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
too that are we building something that
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually will have the consumers stay in
 
04:29:14.870 --> 04:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
state or on their vacation shop in state
 
04:29:16.269 --> 04:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
while they're here and consuming in
 
04:29:18.830 --> 04:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
state or are people going to continue to
 
04:29:21.790 --> 04:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
cross the border to um to show to like
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
qu frankly is the builtup demand in New
 
04:29:25.710 --> 04:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the only reason marijuana
 
04:29:27.670 --> 04:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
miles exist is because we're an island
 
04:29:29.790 --> 04:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
of prohibition surrounded on all borders
 
04:29:32.349 --> 04:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
including Canada of uh of adult use
 
04:29:34.790 --> 04:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
stores so the marijuana mile issue is
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
less of an issue once we actually
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
finally enter that market because we
 
04:29:40.750 --> 04:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't see grocery stores well we see a
 
04:29:42.590 --> 04:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
couple because of our lower tax rate but
 
04:29:44.349 --> 04:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
there's not a huge concentration of a
 
04:29:45.870 --> 04:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of stores right over the border
 
04:29:47.710 --> 04:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
from other states when we have similar
 
04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
products available in both um but
 
04:29:52.269 --> 04:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
getting back to the idea of having a
 
04:29:55.030 --> 04:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
model that's state run we can't do the
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
liquor stores as the state stores
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
because you're right the construction
 
04:29:59.910 --> 04:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
costs are high you're going to need to
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get the location I
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
know how hard it's been to get a really
 
04:30:05.870 --> 04:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
really nice liquor store in Dairy
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
there's quite a few people who are very
 
04:30:09.389 --> 04:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
happy they don't have to drive to
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
londonairy unless they want the greater
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
selection so thank you for helping with
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
that but it's a whole process too that
 
04:30:18.269 --> 04:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that if we do this
 
04:30:20.309 --> 04:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
it solves the issues of it not being
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
legal in the state right now and doesn't
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
create new issues and um I think that
 
04:30:27.269 --> 04:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
the state agency store and pursuing it
 
04:30:29.550 --> 04:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
along that having a small number that
 
04:30:31.389 --> 04:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
initially roll out and then sort of a
 
04:30:33.349 --> 04:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
phased roll out program so that there be
 
04:30:35.710 --> 04:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
can be some visibility and some
 
04:30:39.910 --> 04:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
expectation slow steady and one that if
 
04:30:41.790 --> 04:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
we start to see problems with it we can
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
hit the brakes I think would be the best
 
04:30:45.389 --> 04:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
path forward that would meet the
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
governor's interest in having a
 
04:30:49.990 --> 04:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
state-run model while also drisking for
 
04:30:52.870 --> 04:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
us and making it palatable for investors
 
04:30:54.109 --> 04:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
because just because you build it
 
04:30:55.790 --> 04:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they'll come and it
 
04:30:57.710 --> 04:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be a low enough risk
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them okay so you just
 
04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
introduced a concept here of agency
 
04:31:04.990 --> 04:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
stores and I'm not sure how many
 
04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
know what an agency store is or what's
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
it about or how it operates we have
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
three we have three um two of them
 
04:31:17.910 --> 04:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
actually get their product from a liquor
 
04:31:21.229 --> 04:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
store I don't know if you knew that one
 
04:31:24.269 --> 04:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
of them in Greenville does get its its
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh product directly from the Bonded
 
04:31:29.349 --> 04:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
Warehouse which there is no Bonded
 
04:31:31.550 --> 04:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
Warehouse in your
 
04:31:35.910 --> 04:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
bill so in NE cases you're trying to
 
04:31:39.070 --> 04:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
you're trying to take a model and say oh
 
04:31:42.070 --> 04:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
let's make this work here which is not
 
04:31:45.109 --> 04:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
what your bill is about at all but more
 
04:31:46.990 --> 04:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
importantly here's the most important
 
04:31:48.189 --> 04:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
thing that you need to understand about
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
an agency store not withstanding that
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
they're in located in places where the
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
liquor store said that we would never
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
put a liquor store because there's just
 
04:31:58.429 --> 04:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
not enough customers not enough
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
viability the most important thing is
 
04:32:06.109 --> 04:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
that they are in convenience stores they
 
04:32:08.469 --> 04:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
are in other people's stores that are
 
04:32:10.269 --> 04:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
selling other
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
products that is a violation number one
 
04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
violation of what the governor was
 
04:32:20.910 --> 04:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
looking for and that is is the idea that
 
04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
you are buying through a singular Market
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
entity state Marijuana store that is
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
marketed by the state a convenience
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
store is going to be uh I think it's
 
04:32:38.550 --> 04:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
Greenville Community or a market I
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
forget the name of the name of the
 
04:32:43.469 --> 04:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
market but that it is not that defeats
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose if you think you want
 
04:32:50.309 --> 04:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
to change the idea of this bill to the
 
04:32:53.870 --> 04:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
individual entities being free to
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
advertise on their own free to Market
 
04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
themselves free to have their own
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
name then that flies absolutely in the
 
04:33:05.830 --> 04:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
face of what the government govern was
 
04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
looking for now I realize that when I
 
04:33:10.390 --> 04:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
say that people say well you know who
 
04:33:12.789 --> 04:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
cares what the governor thinks but at
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
this point I do because I want to pass
 
04:33:19.750 --> 04:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
something okay and all I can say to the
 
04:33:22.709 --> 04:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
committee is that anybody is free to say
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
nope don't want to do this let's just
 
04:33:27.470 --> 04:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
can it all together and forget about
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
marijuana this
 
04:33:32.230 --> 04:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
year but I want to remind
 
04:33:34.109 --> 04:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
everybody that there are going to be
 
04:33:35.949 --> 04:33:35.959 align:start position:0%
some other Governors coming
 
04:33:39.230 --> 04:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
forward and I know one of the
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
candidates used to be attorney
 
04:33:46.470 --> 04:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
general probably opposed to it certainly
 
04:33:48.629 --> 04:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
the other Republican candidate is
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
animant opposed to it because he was one
 
04:33:52.990 --> 04:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
of the people who voted against it last
 
04:33:53.000 --> 04:33:53.910 align:start position:0%
of the people who voted against it last
three

04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:33:57.789 --> 04:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
times so if we really want to make
 
04:33:57.799 --> 04:34:00.150 align:start position:0%
times so if we really want to make
marijuana

04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
happen if we this bill needs to be
 
04:34:08.150 --> 04:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
amended to based upon the commission the
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
Senate asked for this commission the
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
Senate President this was under his this
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
was his idea that whatever comes out of
 
04:34:15.600 --> 04:34:16.709 align:start position:0%
was his idea that whatever comes out of
that

04:34:16.709 --> 04:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
commission he would be more
 
04:34:22.910 --> 04:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to passing to voting for it
 
04:34:25.590 --> 04:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
so if it's important to you that we get
 
04:34:25.600 --> 04:34:26.670 align:start position:0%
so if it's important to you that we get
something

04:34:26.670 --> 04:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
accomplished then I'm saying we need to
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
amend it if it's not un important if you
 
04:34:34.750 --> 04:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
think it's more important that we have
 
04:34:36.510 --> 04:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
individual ual
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
locations that market themselves do
 
04:34:41.310 --> 04:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
their thing the free enterprise much
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
like the our neighboring states have
 
04:34:46.429 --> 04:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
done okay and I would argue the reason
 
04:34:47.869 --> 04:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
why they have a marijuana miles is
 
04:34:51.429 --> 04:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
because those towns zoned it that way it
 
04:34:52.590 --> 04:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
was all about
 
04:34:55.830 --> 04:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
zoning if you want
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm just saying we're not going to
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
get it this year so that's the that's
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
the issue so I understand I really truly
 
04:35:06.510 --> 04:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate anyone who says is no no no
 
04:35:08.230 --> 04:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
no come on we're live fore or die let's
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
have his multiple stores all the way
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay the only other model when we take
 
04:35:15.310 --> 04:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
the liquor the only other model was the
 
04:35:18.670 --> 04:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of licenses you issue
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
okay because we're talking in this bill
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
we you know the on the amendment is you
 
04:35:24.551 --> 04:35:24.561 align:start position:0%
know limiting the amount of Licensing
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
the amount of locations you can have
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
okay those I call them the taxi
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
medallions all right and you limit the
 
04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
amount of lot of locations and I'm
 
04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
pretty sure there's nobody who thinks
 
04:35:37.551 --> 04:35:37.561 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea not even all those
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
other states that have hundreds and
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
hundreds of stores all across their
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
state okay there but I do know there are
 
04:35:46.390 --> 04:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
some some states that did pass The
 
04:35:48.910 --> 04:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
Medallion model okay we probably don't
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
want to do that it's an anathema to us
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not the way we did our
 
04:35:55.590 --> 04:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
licenses when it comes to to our on-
 
04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
premise and on off- premise licenses
 
04:35:59.910 --> 04:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm assuming that's off the
 
04:36:02.910 --> 04:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
table so if we really want to do this
 
04:36:06.990 --> 04:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
I'm arguing this is just for humor here
 
04:36:09.629 --> 04:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
I'm arguing that it's going to take
 
04:36:13.429 --> 04:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
multiple years for the producers for the
 
04:36:16.830 --> 04:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
cultivators to get their product growing
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
and make it
 
04:36:22.029 --> 04:36:22.039 align:start position:0%
happen and if we were just to go ahead
 
04:36:24.590 --> 04:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
and pass this limited
 
04:36:28.750 --> 04:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
model and if the legislature next year
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
thinks better of it and thinks that
 
04:36:33.470 --> 04:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we should do something
 
04:36:37.670 --> 04:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
different at least you've already begun
 
04:36:40.551 --> 04:36:40.561 align:start position:0%
the process to get marijuana grown in
 
04:36:43.189 --> 04:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
the state because you've created the
 
04:36:46.310 --> 04:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
cultivators cultivators is a free market
 
04:36:48.789 --> 04:36:48.799 align:start position:0%
we don't limit those we can have as many
 
04:36:51.230 --> 04:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
cultivators as you want it's all based
 
04:36:53.551 --> 04:36:53.561 align:start position:0%
upon Town zoning the cultivators can
 
04:36:53.561 --> 04:36:54.910 align:start position:0%
upon Town zoning the cultivators can
sell

04:36:54.910 --> 04:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
sell
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana will that stay in through the
 
04:37:00.189 --> 04:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely in the bill will it
 
04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
stay in all the way through or will that
 
04:37:04.349 --> 04:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
be removed in the other chamber I that
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
was agreed to by the
 
04:37:09.869 --> 04:37:09.879 align:start position:0%
commission commissioner didn't come out
 
04:37:13.029 --> 04:37:13.039 align:start position:0%
with report no I let me put it this way
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
the commission if you if you were in the
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
room or watch the tape the reason why
 
04:37:19.949 --> 04:37:19.959 align:start position:0%
the commission did not give its seal
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
approval or final approval for and
 
04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
against it was that more than half of
 
04:37:26.709 --> 04:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
the members refused to vote because they
 
04:37:28.510 --> 04:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
thought it was a conflict they shouldn't
 
04:37:30.789 --> 04:37:30.799 align:start position:0%
be evolved the the bankers I ask the
 
04:37:32.349 --> 04:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
bankers well you had a seat at the table
 
04:37:34.349 --> 04:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
why didn't you vote well they didn't
 
04:37:36.189 --> 04:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
think it was appropri
 
04:37:38.429 --> 04:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
okay so it was not to ask the commission
 
04:37:41.390 --> 04:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
to take a vote was not the issue here
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
the issue is this is what was agreed
 
04:37:46.830 --> 04:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
upon so this goes back in part to
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
structuring of that commission um I
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
think you recall that I was involved in
 
04:37:51.789 --> 04:37:51.799 align:start position:0%
that Committee of conference I was
 
04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
chairing it and then let you run that
 
04:37:55.709 --> 04:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
process of find choosing the people that
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
would be part of that commission um I do
 
04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
know that those who are in favor of
 
04:38:02.990 --> 04:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
legalization but were more skeptical of
 
04:38:04.470 --> 04:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
the state model were removed at your
 
04:38:04.480 --> 04:38:05.670 align:start position:0%
the state model were removed at your
request

04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:38:07.830 --> 04:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
um so that they were not members of the
 
04:38:09.949 --> 04:38:09.959 align:start position:0%
commission but we still left some of the
 
04:38:11.670 --> 04:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
groups that were fundamentally um
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to any legalization on the
 
04:38:17.109 --> 04:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
commission and they voted which led to
 
04:38:19.349 --> 04:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
they voted no which led to the challenge
 
04:38:21.310 --> 04:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
of trying to have a commission that
 
04:38:24.070 --> 04:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
entire entire point was charged around
 
04:38:26.510 --> 04:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
drafting legislation for introduction
 
04:38:28.029 --> 04:38:28.039 align:start position:0%
that was the charge of the committee and
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate that it did not did was
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
not able to proceed through um but as
 
04:38:34.750 --> 04:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
you look towards these different issues
 
04:38:37.109 --> 04:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
it it's a matter of making sure that no
 
04:38:38.590 --> 04:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have a convenience
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
store that is also selling it if we do
 
04:38:42.590 --> 04:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
the agency mod agency model is that's
 
04:38:44.551 --> 04:38:44.561 align:start position:0%
what the current Liquor Agency model is
 
04:38:46.629 --> 04:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that we couldn't
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
also have an amendment for next week
 
04:38:50.910 --> 04:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
that would have another amendment
 
04:38:53.670 --> 04:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
building off of 1633 including those
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
sections that are so important to people
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
like the ACLU about the annulments of
 
04:38:59.709 --> 04:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
previous convictions because I saw that
 
04:39:01.949 --> 04:39:01.959 align:start position:0%
those came out of this of the amended
 
04:39:03.869 --> 04:39:03.879 align:start position:0%
version to be able to have ones that
 
04:39:05.109 --> 04:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
some of the stakeholders that are
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
willing to do a lot of compromise to
 
04:39:09.670 --> 04:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
finally reach the finish line here have
 
04:39:12.029 --> 04:39:12.039 align:start position:0%
actually had their key issues removed
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
from the amendment um I haven't been
 
04:39:15.390 --> 04:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
able to look at the entire one but I did
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
look at a few different key sections to
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
try and see what was and what was not
 
04:39:23.269 --> 04:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
there uh so the idea of recognizing that
 
04:39:25.150 --> 04:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
the bill that we introduced so that we
 
04:39:26.670 --> 04:39:26.680 align:start position:0%
would have an option should the
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
commission not not come to fruition is
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
not going to be is not necessarily the
 
04:39:34.230 --> 04:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
final path but we would need to have
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
something where we work and we create a
 
04:39:38.430 --> 04:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
new agency model that is under that
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
umbrella of lior liquor but is not so
 
04:39:44.670 --> 04:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
directly overseen that we are inter we
 
04:39:46.830 --> 04:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
are very very closely intertwined with
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
the operation of what is still federally
 
04:39:50.708 --> 04:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
in illegal process in an illegal
 
04:39:52.030 --> 04:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
business because the Department of
 
04:39:54.750 --> 04:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
Justice has stated that they they have a
 
04:39:56.430 --> 04:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
law saying that they will not act on
 
04:39:57.788 --> 04:39:57.798 align:start position:0%
this but that's only the Department of
 
04:39:59.470 --> 04:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
Justice it's not the Department of
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
Commerce we had the Department of
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
Justice going toes licensed by the state
 
04:40:05.110 --> 04:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
of Georgia and telling them to decent
 
04:40:07.868 --> 04:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
assist from selling cannabis so this is
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
an area that's in play and we need to
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that even though it's state
 
04:40:13.868 --> 04:40:13.878 align:start position:0%
run it's state run at an arms length so
 
04:40:16.190 --> 04:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
that we have some protection um I I do
 
04:40:17.868 --> 04:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
want to say that actually the city of
 
04:40:21.270 --> 04:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
Rochester Maine did a fantastic job with
 
04:40:23.190 --> 04:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
their marijuana mile because I used to
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
drive on that road to go skydiving and
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
it has improved so much now it is a much
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
nicer road to drive on it's not full of
 
04:40:32.550 --> 04:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
rundown Shacks those have been replaced
 
04:40:34.830 --> 04:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
with uh pretty non-descript buildings
 
04:40:37.030 --> 04:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
but um when it comes back to this issue
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
we want to have a way where we can get a
 
04:40:41.830 --> 04:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
state run we have good State control but
 
04:40:44.510 --> 04:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
the state's not at risk and where it's
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
phased in offerings because then it's
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
not a taxi Medallion when there's simply
 
04:40:51.190 --> 04:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
openings I mean we have this our schools
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
are obviously subsidiaries of the state
 
04:40:55.868 --> 04:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
because they are they're they're the the
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
local board covering the school
 
04:40:59.430 --> 04:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
districts but we still have a way that
 
04:41:01.150 --> 04:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
we slowly roll out those School B
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
building funds we have other areas where
 
04:41:06.030 --> 04:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
we roll things out on an as available
 
04:41:07.830 --> 04:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
basis to the public or to other
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
interested parties so by having a staged
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
slow rollout where we can start small
 
04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
with the number of stores figure it out
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
figure out the problems as we move
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
forward and then solve those in a slow
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
soft launch that'll provide a viable
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
Market while protecting the interest of
 
04:41:26.510 --> 04:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
the state I think that's something that
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
we could come to an agreement with not
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
just with those of us in this room and
 
04:41:32.390 --> 04:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
in this chamber but talk to talk to the
 
04:41:33.948 --> 04:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
other body and talk to the governor to
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
see if we can find something where we
 
04:41:38.390 --> 04:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
can recognize that perhaps we don't H
 
04:41:41.550 --> 04:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
really have much marketing at all if
 
04:41:42.948 --> 04:41:42.958 align:start position:0%
it's one of those things that people
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
have known how to seek out for a long
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
time I I have to say that most people
 
04:41:48.910 --> 04:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
will be able to Google search and see
 
04:41:50.670 --> 04:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
where there is a dispensary around them
 
04:41:51.868 --> 04:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
if that's something they're interested
 
04:41:54.830 --> 04:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
in and quite frankly I was offended by
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
some of the marketing that I saw at my
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
in-laws house in California talking
 
04:42:00.070 --> 04:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
about mail order cannabis coming to your
 
04:42:03.510 --> 04:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
house honestly I I'm a little I love the
 
04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
free market I'm a little sketched out
 
04:42:08.830 --> 04:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
about mailed advertisements for cannabis
 
04:42:10.990 --> 04:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
because kids are looking at that so we
 
04:42:12.750 --> 04:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
look at how we can structure this and
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's slow the Market's
 
04:42:16.670 --> 04:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
there we don't need a huge amount of
 
04:42:18.830 --> 04:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
advertising allowed to start why would
 
04:42:20.830 --> 04:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
the state be running a campaign for
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
something that um for cannabis why would
 
04:42:26.190 --> 04:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
the state advertise for a Fed federally
 
04:42:26.200 --> 04:42:28.270 align:start position:0%
the state advertise for a Fed federally
illegal

04:42:28.270 --> 04:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
04:42:31.110 --> 04:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
drug okay so if I understand you
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
correctly you have a vision if we were
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
to change it from franchisee to agency
 
04:42:42.350 --> 04:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
store and an agency store would then pay
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
at the retail other words we will their
 
04:42:47.788 --> 04:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
retail sales we would collect our 15%
 
04:42:50.830 --> 04:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
tax at that point are you talking about
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
the basically the excise tax that we had
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
discussed on the wholesale prices that
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
passed through ways and Mains last year
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
what we have in this
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
bill is no tax because that was somewhat
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
of a touchy issue we have a 15%
 
04:43:08.280 --> 04:43:09.670 align:start position:0%
of a touchy issue we have a 15%
franchise

04:43:09.670 --> 04:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
franchise
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
fee so what you're proposing is that uh
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
because uh you're looking at we're going
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
to change him being a franchise they're
 
04:43:19.310 --> 04:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
not a franchise they're going to be an
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
agency okay so an agency store is then
 
04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
collect I guess we'll have to call it a
 
04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
tax but they're going to collect
 
04:43:35.708 --> 04:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
15% on the sale right just like we
 
04:43:39.350 --> 04:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
collect 15% here from our
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
franchises all right they're going to
 
04:43:45.110 --> 04:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
collect that 15% tax the question is
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
when you say control of the store do the
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
do do each of their stores these
 
04:43:53.310 --> 04:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
agencies can they do whatever they want
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
with the store can they be a bud
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
barn or do they have to
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
be a model franchise location like
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
McDonald's has requirements of about
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
what the location looks like well if
 
04:44:09.788 --> 04:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
it's not a health and safety issue and
 
04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
if it's not a violation of local zoning
 
04:44:14.110 --> 04:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
and ordinances then that gets into the
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
substantial control of the business
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
which gets us back to number two of the
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
check Li check list because no matter
 
04:44:23.110 --> 04:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
what you call it you don't have to call
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
it a franchise for it to legally be
 
04:44:27.708 --> 04:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
considered a franchise under federal law
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
right so leaving that to the zoning of
 
04:44:33.628 --> 04:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
the towns is a local control in one
 
04:44:35.830 --> 04:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
where I I don't see many towns that want
 
04:44:39.230 --> 04:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
to have you know Uncle Mike's Bud Barn I
 
04:44:40.948 --> 04:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
don't think that we want to see
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts had no problem with that
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
but we're not we're not Massachusetts I
 
04:44:46.190 --> 04:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
don't really I'm not really sure that
 
04:44:47.470 --> 04:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to have towns they're going
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
clubhouse he has his own brand which I'm
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
not sure if we'd be able to include if
 
04:44:58.628 --> 04:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
it was all through the state there
 
04:45:00.750 --> 04:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
actually is an example of a franchise
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
within cannabis there's uh cookies that
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
is a franchise but all they sell are
 
04:45:07.110 --> 04:45:07.120 align:start position:0%
things that are not federally prohibited
 
04:45:08.550 --> 04:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
they have seeds and they have the
 
04:45:10.550 --> 04:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
strains that they license out so that's
 
04:45:12.910 --> 04:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
not an any violation of federal law so
 
04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
they have consistent products that are
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
available through their franchises in
 
04:45:20.110 --> 04:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
different states um but I I've as I've
 
04:45:21.628 --> 04:45:21.638 align:start position:0%
traveled i' gone and I've looked to see
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
what the retail environments look like
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
and it seems that people seem to
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate when there's a different
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
experience in different stores because
 
04:45:31.628 --> 04:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
just just like your our liquor stores
 
04:45:34.510 --> 04:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
have a large selection it's important to
 
04:45:36.270 --> 04:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
meet consumer need and so that they
 
04:45:38.110 --> 04:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
aren't going to the black market or to
 
04:45:41.110 --> 04:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
other states by allowing a large diverse
 
04:45:43.708 --> 04:45:43.718 align:start position:0%
product base to develop and not just one
 
04:45:46.510 --> 04:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
that's highly Limited wait a minut out
 
04:45:49.070 --> 04:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
we have all these manufacturers the
 
04:45:51.070 --> 04:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
cultivators and that's a free market
 
04:45:52.550 --> 04:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
there can be as many as they want and do
 
04:45:55.350 --> 04:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
whatever they want I I don't understand
 
04:45:58.390 --> 04:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
where you're thinking the states control
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
over the
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
retail has anything to do with what's
 
04:46:05.390 --> 04:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
the product that sold inside and what
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
the packaging well that's true we do
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
have some packaging requirements I'm not
 
04:46:11.788 --> 04:46:11.798 align:start position:0%
sure whether you're for or against that
 
04:46:14.070 --> 04:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
but that I guess what I'm having trouble
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
trying to draw my mind is what are you
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
looking for other than calling in an
 
04:46:23.430 --> 04:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
agency store rather than a franchisee
 
04:46:26.190 --> 04:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
that what is it you're looking for where
 
04:46:28.030 --> 04:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
the government you don't want you don't
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
want us to have uh the department rules
 
04:46:33.830 --> 04:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
on and then which You're Expecting The
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
Entity need to be have a freeold they
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
can do whatever they want and I guess
 
04:46:40.548 --> 04:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
that's I guess I would have to say I'd
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
have to see your Amendment you've got
 
04:46:46.390 --> 04:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
1633 I'll be interested to see what you
 
04:46:50.670 --> 04:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
bring us next week on what you think we
 
04:46:53.070 --> 04:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
need to fix now if you're willing to do
 
04:46:55.230 --> 04:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
it this way if you're saying no I want
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
to stick with my bill you know then then
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
you know we're all set okay we're you're
 
04:47:02.510 --> 04:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything but if you
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
think that you're I want saying to you
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
is if you can take this
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
amendment and show me you know lay out
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
something that you would say is going to
 
04:47:14.788 --> 04:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
make you feel better about it I am
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
certainly open to that suggestion I just
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
can't visualize what is it that you're
 
04:47:22.990 --> 04:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
thinking that you're freeing up or not
 
04:47:26.708 --> 04:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
uh the question does each location have
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
to look the same or is your idea with
 
04:47:32.230 --> 04:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
the agency store it can be look like a
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
barn so my goal with this is so that if
 
04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
somebody is injured or if one of the
 
04:47:42.868 --> 04:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
franchises believes that they are they
 
04:47:44.548 --> 04:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
have some reason to bring suit against
 
04:47:46.110 --> 04:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
the franchise or which would be the
 
04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I want to make
 
04:47:50.350 --> 04:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
sure that the entire State of New
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all of our assets and all of
 
04:47:57.390 --> 04:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
our funds are not partic not potentially
 
04:47:59.708 --> 04:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
on the hook and not potentially
 
04:48:02.190 --> 04:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
investigated by New Hampshire law
 
04:48:04.628 --> 04:48:04.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement because I'm not not sure if
 
04:48:07.150 --> 04:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
that this this amendment strips it out
 
04:48:11.190 --> 04:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
but in 1633 and in 6 639 that passed the
 
04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
house last year it did not allow New
 
04:48:16.430 --> 04:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police or New Hampshire
 
04:48:18.590 --> 04:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to investigate the
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
violation of federal law if we don't
 
04:48:22.948 --> 04:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
have that prohibition we might have our
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
state investigating our state and
 
04:48:28.548 --> 04:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
freezing our own funds I I obviously I
 
04:48:30.868 --> 04:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
hear you you've said that that now
 
04:48:33.788 --> 04:48:33.798 align:start position:0%
multiple times I don't believe it I have
 
04:48:36.110 --> 04:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
no no I have no reason why to think that
 
04:48:38.788 --> 04:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
McDonald's or Subway or anybody has
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
these issues that you're describing but
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
if you are you are you interested in
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
working with this amendment and changing
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
something in this changing wherever you
 
04:48:52.230 --> 04:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
think it's offensive and that you want
 
04:48:54.270 --> 04:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
to change it
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
from being called a franchise and I
 
04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
don't even know if we use that word in
 
04:49:00.868 --> 04:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
here you do okay that if you want to
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
change it to an
 
04:49:02.920 --> 04:49:04.628 align:start position:0%
change it to an
agency

04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
please feel are you willing to do that
 
04:49:08.830 --> 04:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
is that what you want to do what I want
 
04:49:10.590 --> 04:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
to do is start with the framewor workk
 
04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
of 1633 and draw in as many of the
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
changes from your amendment that I
 
04:49:18.270 --> 04:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
believe are the ones that we can have in
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
order to meet the needs of um all the
 
04:49:23.430 --> 04:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and to be able to move
 
04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
forward with that because my concern I
 
04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
know that you don't share my concern no
 
04:49:28.958 --> 04:49:29.708 align:start position:0%
know that you don't share my concern no
I

04:49:29.708 --> 04:49:29.718 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:49:32.230 --> 04:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
don't I think that I don't I think I
 
04:49:33.910 --> 04:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a red herring I like to play
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
poker I'm not gambling that much we to
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
up to hear what other people have to say
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah sure you're really demeaning her I
 
04:49:43.070 --> 04:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
mean I'm demeaning her yes she has a
 
04:49:45.310 --> 04:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
great background you don't know
 
04:49:47.390 --> 04:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
everything you're treating her like she
 
04:49:49.670 --> 04:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
knows nothing I know I'm just say she
 
04:49:52.270 --> 04:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
just said I don't you agree that I think
 
04:49:55.548 --> 04:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
that that we are exposing these dist the
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
franchise by using this franchise model
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
we're exposing us to all these legal
 
04:50:02.548 --> 04:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
case lawsuits no I I'm being honest I
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
don't agree can that is that
 
04:50:05.948 --> 04:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
illegitimate for me to be saying that no
 
04:50:08.110 --> 04:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
you can say whatever you want okay so
 
04:50:09.670 --> 04:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
you have something well I wanted to know
 
04:50:11.990 --> 04:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
if other people on in in in the room
 
04:50:15.070 --> 04:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
have anything to say um actually can can
 
04:50:16.708 --> 04:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
Matt Simon come up he looks like he
 
04:50:18.350 --> 04:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
wants to say
 
04:50:20.830 --> 04:50:20.840 align:start position:0%
something uh okay thank you
 
04:50:23.430 --> 04:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs has her hand up uh
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:28.270 --> 04:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
um okay the word text gets people upset
 
04:50:31.350 --> 04:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
we all know that um you were discussing
 
04:50:34.590 --> 04:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
this before uh but this may be a
 
04:50:36.868 --> 04:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
simple-minded question but if we can
 
04:50:39.948 --> 04:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
have a 15% franchise fee couldn't we
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
have a 15% agency fee rather than a 15%
 
04:50:47.110 --> 04:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
excise tax exactly you call it whatever
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
you want to call it that's not a problem
 
04:50:51.510 --> 04:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
I think what the issue that she was
 
04:50:54.750 --> 04:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
describing is the amount of
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
control and amount of requirements that
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
is in this in these this amendment that
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
came out of the commission's
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
amendment as compared to a much more
 
04:51:07.670 --> 04:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
Freer model like we have with our agency
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
stores which they are a free to
 
04:51:13.548 --> 04:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
advertise price do whatever they want
 
04:51:15.150 --> 04:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
that that other words they'll have the
 
04:51:16.548 --> 04:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
they don't have to we wouldn't be
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
mandating that they would write 988
 
04:51:20.990 --> 04:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
there would be parameters I mean there
 
04:51:22.430 --> 04:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
would be parameters which I think is
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
what we have to delineate exactly it's
 
04:51:26.190 --> 04:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
not go do whatever the heck you want
 
04:51:27.788 --> 04:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
well sounds it frankly it sounds like
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
sem anics to me but let's find out right
 
04:51:32.310 --> 04:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
well I I'd like to hear what the free
 
04:51:33.868 --> 04:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
market folks in this committee have have
 
04:51:35.948 --> 04:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
to say yeah what are they looking for
 
04:51:37.510 --> 04:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
04:51:40.670 --> 04:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
okay so who who do you want to hear from
 
04:51:44.390 --> 04:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'd love to hear from representative
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
Ammon not to put him on the spot I'm not
 
04:51:49.788 --> 04:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
on this subcommittee
 
04:51:52.708 --> 04:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
um we just got the amendment I I need to
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
understand what's in the amendment and
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh whether we start with the original
 
04:51:58.030 --> 04:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
Bill and fold in the amendment or vice
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
versa like I'm open to seeing that Pro
 
04:52:01.750 --> 04:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'm skeptical it's going to get done by
 
04:52:05.628 --> 04:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
next week but
 
04:52:09.610 --> 04:52:09.620 align:start position:0%
okay represent spe you mentioned that
 
04:52:09.620 --> 04:52:11.510 align:start position:0%
okay represent spe you mentioned that
[Music]

04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:52:15.310 --> 04:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
um that uh people that have are now uh
 
04:52:17.708 --> 04:52:17.718 align:start position:0%
you know the problems that the ACLU has
 
04:52:19.150 --> 04:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
that is that people who have been
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
accused Forman yeah we we took that out
 
04:52:24.590 --> 04:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
my understanding is nman is supposed to
 
04:52:26.350 --> 04:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
be in this bill but I I don't I don't
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
know what ever happened if you're saying
 
04:52:30.750 --> 04:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
nment has been removed out of this bill
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
that's what it looked like when I was
 
04:52:33.390 --> 04:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
doing the comparison I absolutely agree
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
that analment needs to be in this bill
 
04:52:36.868 --> 04:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
that was uh something that uh
 
04:52:39.310 --> 04:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan asked for and I
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
have have no problems putting analment
 
04:52:44.310 --> 04:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
back in so we could put that back in yes
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
can you just describe that inment
 
04:52:49.310 --> 04:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
piece I believe it's that you if you've
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
had a pass possession obviously not ret
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
you not didn't sell it but if you had a
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
pass possession requirement you could
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
olded you could be a or just yeah
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.230 --> 04:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
youve we're we're not asking why you
 
04:53:13.310 --> 04:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
want Anan but yeah if you if if you had
 
04:53:16.430 --> 04:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
any prior possession it would be aned
 
04:53:18.788 --> 04:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
and be sponged from the
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
records what does that have to do with
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
establishing a cannabis industry in New
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a separate criminal
 
04:53:29.470 --> 04:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
justice issue uh it has to do related it
 
04:53:31.190 --> 04:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
has to do with people feeling
 
04:53:32.670 --> 04:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable with passing a marijuana
 
04:53:35.670 --> 04:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
bill cannabis bill so it's an ornament
 
04:53:37.150 --> 04:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
which some like you who are opposed to
 
04:53:39.190 --> 04:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
it you probably it's an ornament yeah
 
04:53:40.350 --> 04:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
you probably think well I mean I might
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
be opposed to that part maybe I mean but
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
it also might be an issue that should be
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
in criminal justice but you're saying
 
04:53:47.830 --> 04:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's an ornament on the Cannabis uh
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
the history of this of the Cannabis
 
04:53:50.910 --> 04:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
legislation it always went through
 
04:53:54.270 --> 04:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
criminal justice because of that reason
 
04:53:55.990 --> 04:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a drafting error you
 
04:53:58.190 --> 04:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
said that the Cannabis cultivations
 
04:54:00.430 --> 04:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to sell to Consumers but
 
04:54:03.070 --> 04:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
on page three line 22 it actually says
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to sell to uh cannabis
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
to an outlet cannabis product
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities to alternative
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
treatment centers and to other cannabis
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities but not to
 
04:54:15.470 --> 04:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
Consumers um you were saying that they
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
would be able to sell to the consumers
 
04:54:18.628 --> 04:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case I think that
 
04:54:19.990 --> 04:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's probably a drafting error and
 
04:54:22.350 --> 04:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
that would need to be corrected yes okay
 
04:54:23.788 --> 04:54:23.798 align:start position:0%
so we'll correct that in anything that
 
04:54:26.670 --> 04:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
moves forward yes thank you so where
 
04:54:28.708 --> 04:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
where did you see that that is Page
 
04:54:31.350 --> 04:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
Three line 22 it says but not to
 
04:54:33.510 --> 04:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
Consumers so that language should say
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
say and to Consumers instead of but not
 
04:54:41.708 --> 04:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
to so replace the but not with and to
 
04:54:46.110 --> 04:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
Consumers yeah okay thank you sorry
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
there'll probably be more because I just
 
04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
looked at it but I know that was one
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
that was very important no problem Mr
 
04:54:52.990 --> 04:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
chair yes can we have Matt Simon just
 
04:54:54.510 --> 04:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
wants to come up for a minute sure of
 
04:54:54.520 --> 04:55:02.390 align:start position:0%
wants to come up for a minute sure of
course

04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.400 --> 04:55:07.548 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:07.548 --> 04:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.310 --> 04:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman honorable
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee good to see you all again A
 
04:55:13.708 --> 04:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
lot's happened since we spent so much
 
04:55:16.470 --> 04:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
time together last year working on HB
 
04:55:19.990 --> 04:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
639 um I thought I actually have mixed
 
04:55:22.470 --> 04:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
feelings about a lot of this so I can't
 
04:55:24.190 --> 04:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to tell you what to do but
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
I think I can share a few comments that
 
04:55:31.948 --> 04:55:31.958 align:start position:0%
will be helpful in some way so uh uh
 
04:55:33.390 --> 04:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
only one member of this committee was
 
04:55:34.390 --> 04:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
was actually part of the study
 
04:55:36.670 --> 04:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
commission so or actually two I'm sorry
 
04:55:38.070 --> 04:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
but uh I think it would be helpful for
 
04:55:40.230 --> 04:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
others to hear a little bit about what
 
04:55:43.230 --> 04:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
the study commission didn't didn't do um
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
so we all went into the study commission
 
04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
process expecting to talk about state
 
04:55:51.150 --> 04:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
run stores and that changed uh I believe
 
04:55:53.150 --> 04:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
in September when the Liquor Commission
 
04:55:55.590 --> 04:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
made a presentation and introduced this
 
04:55:58.110 --> 04:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
franchise model that was the first I'd
 
04:55:59.948 --> 04:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
heard of it and I know this committee
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't discussed that at all um so in in
 
04:56:05.910 --> 04:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
in brief the idea is to maintain the
 
04:56:08.430 --> 04:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
control aspects of the state control
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
model but to have private actors uh
 
04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
actually doing running the the
 
04:56:16.670 --> 04:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
businesses that would be selling so I'm
 
04:56:19.470 --> 04:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
not an attorney uh but I the attorneys
 
04:56:22.110 --> 04:56:22.120 align:start position:0%
that I listened to and Trust said that
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
this model is is less likely to be
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
preempted than the state run stores
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
model and for that reason we were
 
04:56:33.350 --> 04:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
willing to engage uh the atcs were asked
 
04:56:36.350 --> 04:56:36.360 align:start position:0%
present unified testimony which we did
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
we indicated to the study commission
 
04:56:40.628 --> 04:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
that we would be willing to work within
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
the franchise model if the bill
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
reflected the priorities that we've
 
04:56:48.230 --> 04:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
discussed previously the main one for
 
04:56:50.830 --> 04:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
the atc's was integrating the
 
04:56:53.390 --> 04:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program with this
 
04:56:56.030 --> 04:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
new program so the study commission
 
04:56:58.670 --> 04:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
talked about that quite a bit and the
 
04:57:00.990 --> 04:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
key Senators on that study commission
 
04:57:04.910 --> 04:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
did agree uh on a few things um and and
 
04:57:08.070 --> 04:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
to be just clarify I prefer the approach
 
04:57:13.830 --> 04:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
in HB 639 and and in hb1 1633 as policy
 
04:57:16.230 --> 04:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
I also want to get something passed so
 
04:57:17.948 --> 04:57:17.958 align:start position:0%
I'm open to the idea that if there's
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
only one way to pass something we really
 
04:57:22.548 --> 04:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
need to look at that uh but what the
 
04:57:26.430 --> 04:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
study commission did agree on was um the
 
04:57:28.190 --> 04:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
idea to the extent they agreed on
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
anything they ultimately didn't vote to
 
04:57:32.548 --> 04:57:32.558 align:start position:0%
agree on anything but they they agreed
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
that the the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:57:37.350 --> 04:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
program that the actual applying for a
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
card receiving a card the patient
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
registry those sorts of things uh would
 
04:57:43.230 --> 04:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
remain with the Department of Health and
 
04:57:43.240 --> 04:57:44.150 align:start position:0%
remain with the Department of Health and
Human

04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
Human
 
04:57:47.310 --> 04:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
Services and that the ATC is all of the
 
04:57:49.030 --> 04:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
actual business
 
04:57:50.990 --> 04:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
regulation uh because we were talking
 
04:57:52.030 --> 04:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
about the same issue we were talking
 
04:57:54.070 --> 04:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
about last year dual use the idea of
 
04:57:56.310 --> 04:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
having one store where patients can go
 
04:58:00.510 --> 04:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
and adults can go and uh the uh the
 
04:58:02.750 --> 04:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
commission wanted to enable that the
 
04:58:04.030 --> 04:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
issue was having two different
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
Regulators for those stores was viewed
 
04:58:07.990 --> 04:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
as problematic by many people including
 
04:58:11.548 --> 04:58:11.558 align:start position:0%
the chairman so we agreed uh that
 
04:58:13.270 --> 04:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
business regulation could all be under
 
04:58:15.548 --> 04:58:15.558 align:start position:0%
liquor if we were going to go down this
 
04:58:18.430 --> 04:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
this path and uh that they would assume
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility for regulating the
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
business practices of the atcs so
 
04:58:26.590 --> 04:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the study commission did
 
04:58:29.350 --> 04:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
not finish its work I agree with the
 
04:58:31.910 --> 04:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
reasons that were stated why they didn't
 
04:58:33.350 --> 04:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
have a successful vote but I think
 
04:58:35.670 --> 04:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
there's another big reason uh the study
 
04:58:37.990 --> 04:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
commission spent two months going
 
04:58:40.948 --> 04:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
through a draft of of the franchise
 
04:58:43.990 --> 04:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
model and we didn't see a second draft
 
04:58:46.030 --> 04:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
until the very last meeting of the study
 
04:58:48.110 --> 04:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
commission the very last meeting of the
 
04:58:49.548 --> 04:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
study commission we were presented with
 
04:58:52.390 --> 04:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
a second draft that didn't have half of
 
04:58:54.110 --> 04:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
the things that the study commission had
 
04:58:56.430 --> 04:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
agreed on for the last two months so
 
04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
that was very frustrating there this is
 
04:59:02.150 --> 04:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
that bill with a few additions and the
 
04:59:04.270 --> 04:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
additions are POS positive but the
 
04:59:06.190 --> 04:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
additions are very incomplete from my
 
04:59:08.190 --> 04:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
perspective if we're going to pass the
 
04:59:09.788 --> 04:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
franchise model I think we at least need
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
to do the things that the Commissioners
 
04:59:13.910 --> 04:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
agreed on integrating the therapeutic
 
04:59:17.190 --> 04:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
canvas program so if you do want to purs
 
04:59:19.470 --> 04:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
pursue the franchise model approach I
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to work on it as we
 
04:59:26.670 --> 04:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
did HB 639 last year we emerged you know
 
04:59:29.430 --> 04:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
we had 639 we had the the language of
 
04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
1598 and after a few weeks we had
 
04:59:33.548 --> 04:59:33.558 align:start position:0%
smashed them together into one bill bill
 
04:59:35.230 --> 04:59:35.240 align:start position:0%
that everybody was actually pretty happy
 
04:59:38.070 --> 04:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
with it sailed through the house and uh
 
04:59:40.270 --> 04:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
most Advocates were okay with it so that
 
04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
would be approach if the committee wants
 
04:59:43.788 --> 04:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
to work on that I think there are a lot
 
04:59:45.230 --> 04:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders that would be more than
 
04:59:47.390 --> 04:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
happy to go through that process again
 
04:59:48.510 --> 04:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
in this
 
04:59:50.548 --> 04:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
committee another option would be to
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
just pass the bill as is and let the
 
04:59:55.110 --> 04:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
Senate deal with it if you do that I'm
 
04:59:57.270 --> 04:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
100% sure that the Senate will either
 
04:59:59.310 --> 04:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
kill it or do exactly what we're talking
 
05:00:03.070 --> 05:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
about uh work on making the amendment
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
actually something that that people can
 
05:00:08.110 --> 05:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
support so I think this needs a lot of
 
05:00:10.510 --> 05:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
work and whether it happens in this
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
committee or somewhere else um but
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
without getting into the weeds you know
 
05:00:19.590 --> 05:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
as as we've expressed sorry previously
 
05:00:22.350 --> 05:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
we want to build this matters I think
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
for two main reasons one is that the
 
05:00:27.830 --> 05:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
atcs already have infrastructure teams
 
05:00:29.830 --> 05:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
we're we want to help be part of a
 
05:00:31.270 --> 05:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
successful roll out we've heard
 
05:00:32.910 --> 05:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
testimony about New York and other St
 
05:00:35.708 --> 05:00:35.718 align:start position:0%
states that decided to exclude medical
 
05:00:38.310 --> 05:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis businesses and had very bad
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
rollouts as a result they wanted to
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
build everything from scratch and they
 
05:00:45.030 --> 05:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
regretted it big time so for that reason
 
05:00:47.230 --> 05:00:47.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's important you include us I
 
05:00:49.708 --> 05:00:49.718 align:start position:0%
think it's important for the 14,000
 
05:00:51.270 --> 05:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
patients who are registered for our
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
program because the future of the
 
05:00:55.990 --> 05:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program depends on
 
05:00:58.590 --> 05:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
us being successfully integrated into
 
05:01:00.868 --> 05:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
this if we don't do that we're just
 
05:01:02.510 --> 05:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
going to wipe away the therapeutic
 
05:01:02.520 --> 05:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
going to wipe away the therapeutic
canvas

05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
canvas
 
05:01:06.110 --> 05:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
program move aside atcs and we'll
 
05:01:09.628 --> 05:01:09.638 align:start position:0%
replace you with something else so I
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
think we're happy to work with the
 
05:01:12.788 --> 05:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
committee uh whichever direction you
 
05:01:14.430 --> 05:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
want to go and so where where are we
 
05:01:17.150 --> 05:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
looking at that where the problems are
 
05:01:20.310 --> 05:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
well the problems are so I do
 
05:01:24.390 --> 05:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
have a handout but I mean this there's
 
05:01:28.110 --> 05:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
nothing in here about the transition and
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
the integration of the therapeutic
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
canvas program it's just not there the
 
05:01:36.430 --> 05:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
language that was in HB 639 and 1633
 
05:01:39.230 --> 05:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
regarding uh dual use certificates
 
05:01:41.310 --> 05:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
remember all that language that actually
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
imposes obligations on the atcs to cons
 
05:01:46.310 --> 05:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
continue serving patients to not Jack up
 
05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
prices all of that uh that was all in
 
05:01:53.548 --> 05:01:53.558 align:start position:0%
it's just ripped out of this final bill
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
that was presented on the last day of
 
05:01:56.868 --> 05:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
the study commission so it's it's not
 
05:01:58.190 --> 05:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
what they discussed it's not what
 
05:02:00.628 --> 05:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
anybody agreed on but I'm confused
 
05:02:02.788 --> 05:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
because the the two you know I was
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
yesterday one meeting and then of course
 
05:02:07.750 --> 05:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
I had Co and the second meeting so but
 
05:02:10.110 --> 05:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
when I got back you said ATC everything
 
05:02:12.190 --> 05:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
was all
 
05:02:15.390 --> 05:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
solved until we we it was solved in
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
terms of people who had agreed to things
 
05:02:21.190 --> 05:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
that made sense and then when we saw the
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
draft on the last day of the study
 
05:02:24.830 --> 05:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
commission that morning have do you have
 
05:02:27.910 --> 05:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
the language that was agreed
 
05:02:32.230 --> 05:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
to it was not drafted it has never been
 
05:02:34.270 --> 05:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
drafted this was something that you had
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
just a verbal discussion and CU When I
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
every meeting I went to everything was
 
05:02:41.548 --> 05:02:41.558 align:start position:0%
word going through and words smithing
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
every paragraph and everything but
 
05:02:45.628 --> 05:02:45.638 align:start position:0%
you're saying you had agreements I guess
 
05:02:48.150 --> 05:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
I have to go back and watch the tape I
 
05:02:50.390 --> 05:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
or talk to the three Senators whose
 
05:02:52.708 --> 05:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
votes are needed to support this from
 
05:02:55.110 --> 05:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
two different parties and this was what
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
they agreed to
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
verbally everybody was waiting to see a
 
05:03:01.150 --> 05:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
draft the draft never had tell me what
 
05:03:02.990 --> 05:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
it is so I can ask him what are we
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
missing here what were the what were the
 
05:03:07.948 --> 05:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
things that would agreed to you say you
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
have it written
 
05:03:12.190 --> 05:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
down I mean I have it it was a concept
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
that was never drafted into legislative
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
language I believe I offered to try
 
05:03:18.708 --> 05:03:18.718 align:start position:0%
drafting it at some point but I wasn't
 
05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
on the study commission yeah but what I
 
05:03:21.990 --> 05:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
remember when I had this conversation
 
05:03:23.868 --> 05:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
with you my memory was you said yeah
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
this is what was agreed
 
05:03:27.750 --> 05:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
to there are some things that were
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
agreed to and some things that weren't
 
05:03:31.110 --> 05:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
so there a couple POS can you have that
 
05:03:32.948 --> 05:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
drawn up can you write up what was
 
05:03:36.230 --> 05:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
agreed to and and and make it so it fits
 
05:03:40.070 --> 05:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
into to this amendment I'll just can I
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
inter it's obviously was agreed to
 
05:03:44.788 --> 05:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
because was ex out in
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
the get in there wasn't agreed to struck
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
through in the amendment so it it had to
 
05:03:55.270 --> 05:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:57.830 --> 05:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere uh just that was what was came
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
from the notes from the committee Mr
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
chairman can this gentleman introduce
 
05:04:02.270 --> 05:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
himself and speak to the microphone for
 
05:04:04.708 --> 05:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
everyone okay would you mind I mean are
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
we have we having a public hearing
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
or so all I'm asking for is myself
 
05:04:12.750 --> 05:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
attorney Mike Mofford represents
 
05:04:15.310 --> 05:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary ATC been working with Matt on
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
this for the last several months and if
 
05:04:19.390 --> 05:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
I've got a document last night from your
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
courtesy that you write it to us right
 
05:04:24.270 --> 05:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
which has words in it concerning the
 
05:04:26.270 --> 05:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
atcs and their dual license and their
 
05:04:28.590 --> 05:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
ability to participate with now which is
 
05:04:30.750 --> 05:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
the integrated license which is struck
 
05:04:33.590 --> 05:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
through so logically thinking somebody
 
05:04:36.470 --> 05:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
wrote that down and that was the basis
 
05:04:38.750 --> 05:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
of the agreement was that we worked on
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
the issue we came up with words the
 
05:04:42.670 --> 05:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
words are here and the words are struck
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
through so you cannot pretend that they
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
didn't exist I I'm not as saying they
 
05:04:50.750 --> 05:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
didn't exist I'm just shocked that that
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
it didn't make it to this document okay
 
05:04:55.310 --> 05:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't there those days and I
 
05:04:57.390 --> 05:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
have to admit no what I sent you I did
 
05:05:00.430 --> 05:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
not read that was what I was given from
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
from the senators from what was agreed
 
05:05:05.390 --> 05:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
so can you tell me what the RSA what was
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
the references so I can go back and look
 
05:05:10.190 --> 05:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
at it and so we can make sure we get it
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
in to the bill if that's what was agreed
 
05:05:14.868 --> 05:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
to we we would want to put it back in
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
the bill if it was agreed to well if you
 
05:05:19.590 --> 05:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
look on page actually last night's
 
05:05:22.390 --> 05:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
document page 13 okay so all right I
 
05:05:23.830 --> 05:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have I don't have that
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
with me but okay so what is what what am
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
I being handed here what what did I just
 
05:05:31.070 --> 05:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
get here it would be 318
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
F7 say it again regulation of candid Mr
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
chairman if I may uh the language that
 
05:05:42.510 --> 05:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
we suggested which it's the deleted
 
05:05:44.910 --> 05:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
language with a few tweaks is what's
 
05:05:48.150 --> 05:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
printed in Blue on page two and three
 
05:05:50.270 --> 05:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay of this handout I prepared this
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
handout this morning very rapidly the
 
05:05:57.150 --> 05:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
first point is the lack of any
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
integration uh between the TCP and the
 
05:06:01.990 --> 05:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
pro proposed franchise model that's just
 
05:06:04.510 --> 05:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
it was never written it was agreed upon
 
05:06:07.590 --> 05:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
Orly and never written so that that's
 
05:06:09.788 --> 05:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
work that still needs to be done that's
 
05:06:12.470 --> 05:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
on page on your page one that's on my
 
05:06:15.030 --> 05:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
page one was never drafted into the
 
05:06:17.310 --> 05:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
legislation okay I wanted to praise a
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
couple of things that did happen since
 
05:06:22.030 --> 05:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
the study commission ended so
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
the Not only was this language not
 
05:06:26.590 --> 05:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
present but that draft that we got on
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
the last day of the commission actually
 
05:06:29.788 --> 05:06:29.798 align:start position:0%
included this line that you can see
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
crossed out in blue that says
 
05:06:34.190 --> 05:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers cannot be
 
05:06:36.270 --> 05:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
licensed at the same location as
 
05:06:38.910 --> 05:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
franchise cannabis retail outlets that
 
05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
was the opposite of what the study
 
05:06:42.070 --> 05:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
commission had agreed on well that's why
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's crossed out and that's why it's
 
05:06:46.750 --> 05:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
crossed out now it was not crossed out
 
05:06:48.270 --> 05:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
on the last day of the study commission
 
05:06:50.270 --> 05:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
when this language was presented what's
 
05:06:53.910 --> 05:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
it in this bill uh this bill I was going
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
to praise the deletion of that line uh
 
05:07:00.350 --> 05:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
it no longer says we can't be collocated
 
05:07:02.628 --> 05:07:02.638 align:start position:0%
okay it is completely silent on the
 
05:07:05.070 --> 05:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
subject of location collocation there's
 
05:07:08.230 --> 05:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
no path forward there's no Ru making
 
05:07:10.628 --> 05:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
there's nothing for DHHS there are no
 
05:07:13.150 --> 05:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
changes to the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:07:15.510 --> 05:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
law the work that would need to happen
 
05:07:17.390 --> 05:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
to make these things integrate has not
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
been done the study commission did not
 
05:07:22.110 --> 05:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
do it uh the other thing I was going to
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
praise simply because I mentioned in
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
testimony last week was the new in the
 
05:07:28.548 --> 05:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
bill is specific language regarding hemp
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
derived canabo so I think we''ve made
 
05:07:33.708 --> 05:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
two steps forward since the study
 
05:07:37.830 --> 05:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
commission finished its efforts uh but I
 
05:07:40.510 --> 05:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
think we're a long way to go as far as
 
05:07:43.150 --> 05:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
specific changes to integrate the
 
05:07:45.350 --> 05:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
program we can go into that if we're
 
05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
going to have a a non-gain public
 
05:07:49.470 --> 05:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on this uh otherwise I don't
 
05:07:53.150 --> 05:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
want to get too far into details it
 
05:07:57.750 --> 05:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:00.510 --> 05:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
Concepts yes I I just C could you
 
05:08:02.230 --> 05:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
clarify with the um the gentleman next
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't know your name Mike
 
05:08:07.190 --> 05:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay I was wonder what document did you
 
05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
get that you document we received a
 
05:08:11.868 --> 05:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
document last night called draft working
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
with edits and that was from the
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
courtesy of of chairman hunt right I'm
 
05:08:16.788 --> 05:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
just curious why the committee didn't
 
05:08:19.948 --> 05:08:19.958 align:start position:0%
get that uh I it was what was sent to me
 
05:08:23.350 --> 05:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
for the commission and I I I sorry I
 
05:08:25.750 --> 05:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
didn't send it out to the committee I I
 
05:08:28.270 --> 05:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
thought I sent it out to everybody but
 
05:08:30.430 --> 05:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
but this document shows the items were
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
remove I can send it to you right now I
 
05:08:34.030 --> 05:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
don't we have it now we got something
 
05:08:37.150 --> 05:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
from you didn't we you don't have it
 
05:08:39.230 --> 05:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
okay well that's another
 
05:08:41.628 --> 05:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
problem and there's somewhat of a a myth
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the commission there
 
05:08:45.390 --> 05:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
was some form of agreement uh during the
 
05:08:46.750 --> 05:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
whole course of the commission the
 
05:08:49.510 --> 05:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
discussion of dual use certificates
 
05:08:51.548 --> 05:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
participation of the atc's it was going
 
05:08:53.110 --> 05:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
beautifully smoothly until all of a
 
05:08:56.708 --> 05:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
sudden pop at the end day it was a
 
05:08:58.270 --> 05:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
complete disaster because you had no
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
idea we were Sid swiped by suddenly
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
being swept away and and to elude that
 
05:09:05.910 --> 05:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
the commission had any type of agreement
 
05:09:07.590 --> 05:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
is really a far
 
05:09:12.030 --> 05:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
reach Mr chairman okay so uh go ahead I
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
do have a question do you think it was
 
05:09:14.830 --> 05:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
problem I mean I know that the
 
05:09:17.070 --> 05:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
commission was open anybody could attend
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
do you think it was problematic that
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
there were not industry experts on the
 
05:09:24.230 --> 05:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
Commission in retrospect this there were
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues with the commission and
 
05:09:27.948 --> 05:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
that certainly was one of them okay we
 
05:09:29.070 --> 05:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
had competing interests on the
 
05:09:30.548 --> 05:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
commission people working desperately
 
05:09:32.830 --> 05:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
hard to trip us up up at every
 
05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
particular juncture and they waited till
 
05:09:37.510 --> 05:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
the last day to pull the rug out from
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
one be everybody all I remember was when
 
05:09:42.070 --> 05:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
I came back and I was starting about
 
05:09:43.390 --> 05:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
what I thought where we were and you
 
05:09:46.510 --> 05:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
said no no John you were gone every this
 
05:09:50.070 --> 05:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
was all solved that's all I remember but
 
05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
you can't blame me must have been but I
 
05:09:54.750 --> 05:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
do see something Municipal zoning and or
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
local regulation cannot prohibit the
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
licensing of an integrated Canabis
 
05:10:01.040 --> 05:10:03.548 align:start position:0%
licensing of an integrated Canabis
establishment

05:10:03.548 --> 05:10:03.558 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
05:10:05.110 --> 05:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know how I just popped and fall
 
05:10:06.750 --> 05:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
into that but how are we going to tell
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
the municipal what they can or can't
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
do well that's wonderful except no way
 
05:10:15.150 --> 05:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
does it say we can have a dual use
 
05:10:18.430 --> 05:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
license okay so to get down to the
 
05:10:21.270 --> 05:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
bottom line is is the Dual use license
 
05:10:22.750 --> 05:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
issue is that what the problem is here
 
05:10:24.350 --> 05:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
or we can call it the integrated license
 
05:10:25.830 --> 05:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
or the Dual
 
05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
use yes that that's I guess I the way I
 
05:10:32.230 --> 05:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
remembered it was that is that you would
 
05:10:34.548 --> 05:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
get the regular franchise you g to take
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
your locations you already
 
05:10:41.310 --> 05:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
had and you would then be uh submit them
 
05:10:43.830 --> 05:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
to the state as and make them a
 
05:10:46.510 --> 05:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
fullblown location but knowing that you
 
05:10:48.430 --> 05:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
would then have to collect the tax or
 
05:10:51.470 --> 05:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
the franchise fee is that did I am I
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding Mr chairman
 
05:10:56.670 --> 05:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
that is not what this bill says Okay so
 
05:10:58.910 --> 05:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does not say anything
 
05:11:04.590 --> 05:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:07.190 --> 05:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
the way I understand it atc's could
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
theoretically apply for these licenses
 
05:11:11.628 --> 05:11:11.638 align:start position:0%
and cor we would be expected to wait in
 
05:11:15.150 --> 05:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
line with everybody else and there is no
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
Ru making to explain how this integrates
 
05:11:21.230 --> 05:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
with the program that we already have if
 
05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
we want to have a single regulator for
 
05:11:25.750 --> 05:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
adult use cannabis this bill doesn't do
 
05:11:25.760 --> 05:11:26.990 align:start position:0%
adult use cannabis this bill doesn't do
it

05:11:26.990 --> 05:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:11:29.788 --> 05:11:29.798 align:start position:0%
okay it creates a new system to compete
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
with the existing system
 
05:11:33.120 --> 05:11:35.310 align:start position:0%
with the existing system
okay

05:11:35.310 --> 05:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:37.788 --> 05:11:37.798 align:start position:0%
question yes representing you so I've
 
05:11:40.150 --> 05:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
heard you both say that the commission
 
05:11:43.030 --> 05:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
let you down stuff came in at the last
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
minute I heard you also say that we're
 
05:11:48.030 --> 05:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
the committee's largely uninformed
 
05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
because we weren't on the commission
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
you're terribly wrong there because
 
05:11:52.628 --> 05:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
we're incredibly informed right it's our
 
05:11:54.230 --> 05:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
job to be informed here and we are just
 
05:11:55.230 --> 05:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
because we weren't on the commission
 
05:11:56.270 --> 05:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we didn't watch them and
 
05:11:58.548 --> 05:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
read all the materials so thanks for the
 
05:12:00.070 --> 05:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
joke about getting into the weeds but
 
05:12:01.910 --> 05:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
let's not get into the weeds would you
 
05:12:03.390 --> 05:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
age that there's a long ways to go and
 
05:12:05.470 --> 05:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to make changes to this come
 
05:12:07.070 --> 05:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
with the draft to the bill we're working
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
with now or let's send it to interim
 
05:12:10.910 --> 05:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
study and get it right the the next time
 
05:12:13.750 --> 05:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
during that study period so which is it
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
do you want to complain about the
 
05:12:16.230 --> 05:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
commission not getting it right or do
 
05:12:17.310 --> 05:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
you want to change this one or do you
 
05:12:18.868 --> 05:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
want to send it interim study
 
05:12:20.910 --> 05:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
representative I am not here to complain
 
05:12:22.948 --> 05:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
we've been participating in good faith
 
05:12:26.190 --> 05:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
in this process for years and we will
 
05:12:28.590 --> 05:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
continue to participate in good faith
 
05:12:30.750 --> 05:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
trying to create good cannabis policy
 
05:12:32.910 --> 05:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
for the people of New Hampshire
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
if it's the will of this committee to
 
05:12:36.628 --> 05:12:36.638 align:start position:0%
work on the details of this bill we'll
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
be here to work on the details of this
 
05:12:40.548 --> 05:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
bill if you want to pass it as is we'll
 
05:12:41.910 --> 05:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
work on it somewhere
 
05:12:44.708 --> 05:12:44.718 align:start position:0%
else it's I don't even know how I would
 
05:12:46.270 --> 05:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
vote if I were sitting in your shoes
 
05:12:48.830 --> 05:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
frankly because I see both sides I see
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
the desire to get something done no
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
matter what it says I also believe
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
having worked in cannabis policy for 17
 
05:12:57.310 --> 05:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
years that there are a lot of very
 
05:13:00.390 --> 05:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
important policy choices here that I
 
05:13:03.110 --> 05:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't feel legislature generally has a
 
05:13:06.070 --> 05:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
great understanding of and uh I don't
 
05:13:07.628 --> 05:13:07.638 align:start position:0%
think they're addressed in this this
 
05:13:09.070 --> 05:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
bill in front of
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
us and I'd like to correct the record
 
05:13:12.670 --> 05:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
because I don't recall ever saying you
 
05:13:15.270 --> 05:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
were uninformed the issue here is again
 
05:13:16.948 --> 05:13:16.958 align:start position:0%
what we had the last day of the uh
 
05:13:19.628 --> 05:13:19.638 align:start position:0%
commission was we have a brand new 40
 
05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
page Bill the needs analysis you didn't
 
05:13:24.230 --> 05:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
it was your your colleague it was just
 
05:13:25.830 --> 05:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
before you uh stood up and interrupted
 
05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:30.760 --> 05:13:32.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:13:32.910 --> 05:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:13:35.150 --> 05:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
ially we're talking about when the bill
 
05:13:38.190 --> 05:13:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:41.830 --> 05:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:58.430 --> 05:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.270 --> 05:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
the should
 
05:14:08.990 --> 05:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:13.150 --> 05:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:17.070 --> 05:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
have that's your your The $64,000
 
05:14:18.628 --> 05:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
Question is what which one are we what
 
05:14:20.230 --> 05:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
are we going to work from we're not
 
05:14:21.470 --> 05:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
going to work from the amendment Mr
 
05:14:25.230 --> 05:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
chairman should we just pass H hb1 1633
 
05:14:27.670 --> 05:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
and then the Senate can go through this
 
05:14:30.150 --> 05:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
amendment process if they want I mean I
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
assured with un no questions whatsoever
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
if you send over that bill if it doesn't
 
05:14:37.868 --> 05:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
have anything that look like the
 
05:14:40.990 --> 05:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
commission it's Dead on
 
05:14:43.708 --> 05:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
Arrival that's what the Senators tell
 
05:14:47.948 --> 05:14:47.958 align:start position:0%
me I mean that maybe I they what they
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
say and what they do who knows but I
 
05:14:51.310 --> 05:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
mean maybe they will I I think great
 
05:14:52.708 --> 05:14:52.718 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead just send it up it makes
 
05:14:54.948 --> 05:14:54.958 align:start position:0%
my life easier just send it all over
 
05:14:57.868 --> 05:14:57.878 align:start position:0%
this is send it over there lot of time
 
05:15:00.150 --> 05:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's not getting anywhere and I think
 
05:15:02.830 --> 05:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that the house overall
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly just like the last one is
 
05:15:06.670 --> 05:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
pretty comfortable with so I mean it is
 
05:15:09.788 --> 05:15:09.798 align:start position:0%
a good message to send
 
05:15:11.670 --> 05:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't know it seems like we're
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
just like spinning our wheels and not
 
05:15:14.670 --> 05:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
making a lot of progress with this
 
05:15:18.310 --> 05:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
discussion and I think if the Senate
 
05:15:21.390 --> 05:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
realizes that this is actually a a
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
process that we or a model that we're
 
05:15:25.230 --> 05:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable with in the house pretty
 
05:15:26.948 --> 05:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
strongly comfortable in the house then
 
05:15:30.190 --> 05:15:30.200 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe they might be willing to I
 
05:15:31.390 --> 05:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
mean what they're saying now but maybe
 
05:15:32.990 --> 05:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
they maybe they will change like when
 
05:15:35.830 --> 05:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
they see a strong bipartisan vote again
 
05:15:38.230 --> 05:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
I mean at the end of the day it was
 
05:15:39.750 --> 05:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
driven by the
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
governor's concept of the of the
 
05:15:46.110 --> 05:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
franchise so if fundamentally if you
 
05:15:47.788 --> 05:15:47.798 align:start position:0%
don't send them
 
05:15:51.070 --> 05:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
that then it's Dead on Arrival yeah then
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
he own here why why why do we even exist
 
05:15:59.470 --> 05:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
but no not no come well he does he does
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
anyway why don't you ask the con
 
05:16:03.390 --> 05:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
why how did they why did they create the
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
Constitution the way they did I don't
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
know that you can't start out saying the
 
05:16:08.788 --> 05:16:08.798 align:start position:0%
governor's not going to sign it so we're
 
05:16:11.150 --> 05:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
not going to pass it so that's what what
 
05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
we do here I
 
05:16:16.510 --> 05:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
thought I thought the Senate the
 
05:16:19.110 --> 05:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
senators were going to put the franchise
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
model they were going to introduce that
 
05:16:24.030 --> 05:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
bill then they
 
05:16:28.868 --> 05:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
didn't okay so I I guess the best I can
 
05:16:32.470 --> 05:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
say to them is um uh we you know that if
 
05:16:34.430 --> 05:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
they if that's what they want if they
 
05:16:36.868 --> 05:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
need to send us what they want is what
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying okay and all we can do is
 
05:16:41.070 --> 05:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
send them send them whatever you want to
 
05:16:43.628 --> 05:16:43.638 align:start position:0%
send them and don't be surprised that it
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
won't look like anything that they sent
 
05:16:46.750 --> 05:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
and then we can review it at that time
 
05:16:48.830 --> 05:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
when exactly right we would then when
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
the bill comes
 
05:16:53.430 --> 05:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
back I will I will but it evidently is
 
05:16:55.470 --> 05:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
in hopelessly flawed when I've just
 
05:16:57.548 --> 05:16:57.558 align:start position:0%
heard is that it's got lots of stuff
 
05:17:00.190 --> 05:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
like the nment wasn't in it was he I
 
05:17:02.750 --> 05:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
mean it was close from the aflc mean
 
05:17:02.760 --> 05:17:04.670 align:start position:0%
mean it was close from the aflc mean
excuse

05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
05:17:07.310 --> 05:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
me what yes what were you going to say
 
05:17:09.190 --> 05:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
sorry you were you were standing up to
 
05:17:12.310 --> 05:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
say something Y come on up come on up to
 
05:17:14.470 --> 05:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
the mic introduce
 
05:17:17.910 --> 05:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
yourself at least it would have no I was
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
Tim Egan um Tim Egan had asked to come
 
05:17:26.190 --> 05:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:28.750 --> 05:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
word thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record New
 
05:17:33.590 --> 05:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can chair Timothy Ean Mr chair
 
05:17:35.590 --> 05:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
I think we've actually made tremendous
 
05:17:38.548 --> 05:17:38.558 align:start position:0%
progress today we actually see this
 
05:17:41.070 --> 05:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment I think we've heard
 
05:17:43.990 --> 05:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
from an array of the folks that have an
 
05:17:46.350 --> 05:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
expressed interest in trying to legalize
 
05:17:48.430 --> 05:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
regulate and create revenue from
 
05:17:52.190 --> 05:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
Cannabis I think this bill shows
 
05:17:52.200 --> 05:17:53.830 align:start position:0%
Cannabis I think this bill shows
some

05:17:53.830 --> 05:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:17:56.310 --> 05:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
possibilities um I think I'm very
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
respective and and happy that the
 
05:18:00.910 --> 05:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
portion of the proceeds that re would
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
come from cannabis to our state would
 
05:18:04.670 --> 05:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
help things like pension fund liability
 
05:18:07.190 --> 05:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
and education and with all due respect
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
to the Cannabis uh to The Liquor
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
Commission I'm surprised that uh a
 
05:18:13.628 --> 05:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
listing of the Cannabis Advisory Board
 
05:18:15.390 --> 05:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
does not have any professionals from the
 
05:18:17.590 --> 05:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry listed in it so I
 
05:18:18.590 --> 05:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
think that's something that could be
 
05:18:20.910 --> 05:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
worked on there are anman submission
 
05:18:22.590 --> 05:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
there's dual licensure missing I'm not
 
05:18:23.750 --> 05:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to repeat everything that all the
 
05:18:25.948 --> 05:18:25.958 align:start position:0%
other my colleagues have said and the
 
05:18:27.670 --> 05:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
reason I refer them as colleagues is for
 
05:18:30.310 --> 05:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
the last three years what I have
 
05:18:31.868 --> 05:18:31.878 align:start position:0%
lovingly called in my
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
my schedule the New Hampshire cannabis
 
05:18:37.750 --> 05:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
Coalition is an array of folks from all
 
05:18:39.628 --> 05:18:39.638 align:start position:0%
the organizations that have ADV invested
 
05:18:42.670 --> 05:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
interest in regulate legalizing
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
regulating making cannabis safety I
 
05:18:46.628 --> 05:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
think are very interested to try and
 
05:18:48.110 --> 05:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
work together I know there's a short
 
05:18:52.750 --> 05:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
window but I do know that both um folks
 
05:18:56.030 --> 05:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
from the industry and the legisl tours
 
05:18:58.070 --> 05:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
that have uh expressed interest who have
 
05:18:59.548 --> 05:18:59.558 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill and co-sponsored
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
this bill and as well as as you sir we
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
have an interest in making sure that
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
this is the best piece of legislation
 
05:19:09.510 --> 05:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
that we can collectively create to
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
benefit the people of New Hampshire so
 
05:19:14.190 --> 05:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
given some time I think we can do that I
 
05:19:16.150 --> 05:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
know there's a clock that is ticking so
 
05:19:17.788 --> 05:19:17.798 align:start position:0%
from which bill which which one do you
 
05:19:19.390 --> 05:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
want to work on I think it's a little
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
bit of mishing the clay together and
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
figuring out if we make a pot or a bowl
 
05:19:27.150 --> 05:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
or a this is going to have a lid but I
 
05:19:28.350 --> 05:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be a little of both
 
05:19:32.230 --> 05:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
so okay so representative
 
05:19:34.510 --> 05:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
Ball's going to be in your court you
 
05:19:38.430 --> 05:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
come up with an amendment for next week
 
05:19:42.788 --> 05:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:46.708 --> 05:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
happy cuz the Liquor's not
 
05:19:50.310 --> 05:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
here Liquor's not here so this is this
 
05:19:52.670 --> 05:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
is your room right here you bring us
 
05:19:54.510 --> 05:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
something on Wednesday they're here but
 
05:19:56.670 --> 05:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
they're here we know what they want
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
which which one are you this is your
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that you offered correct has
 
05:20:00.788 --> 05:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
your name at the top of it that's
 
05:20:02.390 --> 05:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
correct represents what Liquor
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
Commission what the governor and what
 
05:20:05.510 --> 05:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
potential Senators that would have
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
influence on this version then you know
 
05:20:10.708 --> 05:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
you're working from their from the
 
05:20:12.030 --> 05:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
beginning that they start this
 
05:20:14.310 --> 05:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
conversation from there all right are
 
05:20:17.070 --> 05:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
you willing to do that I I think that
 
05:20:18.750 --> 05:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
I'll look at the two find the different
 
05:20:20.190 --> 05:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
sections and figure out where those
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:28.830 --> 05:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
and sorry I live in dream and
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and crosswalks um I will
 
05:20:33.310 --> 05:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
look at both of them and understand the
 
05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
different sections figure out where they
 
05:20:36.910 --> 05:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
map together and then just figure out
 
05:20:39.310 --> 05:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
the most cohesive way to get the
 
05:20:41.910 --> 05:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
information presented in a way where we
 
05:20:44.070 --> 05:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
can understand what we're actually doing
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
and we understand what the choices are
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
right um I just want to make it so that
 
05:20:49.948 --> 05:20:49.958 align:start position:0%
it's all as clear and possible to see
 
05:20:52.110 --> 05:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
and um as we draft that and try and
 
05:20:54.070 --> 05:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
reflect all of the hard work that's
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
happened in this room over the summer
 
05:20:58.990 --> 05:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
among the Coalition over these years and
 
05:21:01.548 --> 05:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
to try and finally put this behind us in
 
05:21:03.948 --> 05:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
a way that makes us all happy I think is
 
05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
something that is absolutely worth doing
 
05:21:08.350 --> 05:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
sounds great so you'll have something
 
05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
for us for next Wednesday I will okay
 
05:21:13.548 --> 05:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'll then ask is there
 
05:21:16.070 --> 05:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
anybody else in the room other than
 
05:21:18.868 --> 05:21:18.878 align:start position:0%
atc's that has anything that needs to be
 
05:21:22.510 --> 05:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
changed in this bill other than agency
 
05:21:25.350 --> 05:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
you know franchise to agencies and this
 
05:21:28.830 --> 05:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and and making sure that
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
cultivators can sell and if I can just
 
05:21:32.788 --> 05:21:32.798 align:start position:0%
make a request if there was anything
 
05:21:34.590 --> 05:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
from the group or anybody if they can
 
05:21:36.670 --> 05:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
contact me within the next uh before the
 
05:21:38.470 --> 05:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
end of tomorrow with that so that I can
 
05:21:40.510 --> 05:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
be just have a starting work workplace
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
to work from my email is on the
 
05:21:45.190 --> 05:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
legislative site representative L on
 
05:21:47.150 --> 05:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative walls you have a
 
05:21:50.868 --> 05:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
question yes it goes thank you chairman
 
05:21:52.788 --> 05:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
we don't do questions
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
comment um well it goes back to what you
 
05:21:58.590 --> 05:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
saw stated it was the first thing I saw
 
05:22:02.070 --> 05:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
that g on uh I think it's a second or
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
third page it talks about Municipal
 
05:22:07.070 --> 05:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
zoning Andor local regulation cannot
 
05:22:09.788 --> 05:22:09.798 align:start position:0%
prohibit the licensing when did that
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
happen I thought that there was an opt
 
05:22:16.990 --> 05:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
out uh I all I know is uh theoretically
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill is that the
 
05:22:23.070 --> 05:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
municipality has a vote to decide what
 
05:22:25.470 --> 05:22:25.480 align:start position:0%
they can have or can't have right so
 
05:22:29.708 --> 05:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
this is false so uh that seems to fly my
 
05:22:33.230 --> 05:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
to my understanding correct right but so
 
05:22:36.310 --> 05:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
we'll take it as it is see what it is
 
05:22:38.708 --> 05:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
and send it on to the Senate and see
 
05:22:40.830 --> 05:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
what they do with
 
05:22:45.510 --> 05:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:48.030 --> 05:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
it at least if they left that in there
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
I'll bet you the Senate would kill it
 
05:22:50.910 --> 05:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
just on
 
05:22:52.948 --> 05:22:52.958 align:start position:0%
that just
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
saying excuse me I really would like to
 
05:22:57.990 --> 05:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
see that crossed out copy because I'd
 
05:23:01.230 --> 05:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
like to see what it was that was driving
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
the I will right now find that and send
 
05:23:09.510 --> 05:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:13.430 --> 05:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:16.150 --> 05:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
else no
 
05:23:21.190 --> 05:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
yes in the day yep I just I'm with
 
05:23:26.548 --> 05:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
the ex director um and I just want to
 
05:23:28.830 --> 05:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you all for all the time and the
 
05:23:30.350 --> 05:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
effort that you have put into this
 
05:23:30.360 --> 05:23:32.030 align:start position:0%
effort that you have put into this
conversation

05:23:32.030 --> 05:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
05:23:34.510 --> 05:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
I really want I think there has been a
 
05:23:37.270 --> 05:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
lot of progress made today I don't think
 
05:23:38.670 --> 05:23:38.680 align:start position:0%
it's likely that we're all going to be
 
05:23:40.230 --> 05:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
happy with anything that comes out of
 
05:23:42.150 --> 05:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
this this is what I said at at uh
 
05:23:44.590 --> 05:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
previously but I really do think it is
 
05:23:46.390 --> 05:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
worth the work of this committee to get
 
05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
as close something as good as can be
 
05:23:51.788 --> 05:23:51.798 align:start position:0%
that is as close to being able to pass
 
05:23:51.798 --> 05:23:52.628 align:start position:0%
that is as close to being able to pass
as

05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:23:55.350 --> 05:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
possible out of this committee I I think
 
05:23:57.390 --> 05:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
there is time to work on it I know we'll
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
be willing to work with the committee um
 
05:24:02.510 --> 05:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
to get as as at the bill to a place as
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
as good as it can be um there were many
 
05:24:06.750 --> 05:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
things that were in the version that
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
came out of the commission there were
 
05:24:09.390 --> 05:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
many issues we had with the commission
 
05:24:10.868 --> 05:24:10.878 align:start position:0%
process there were things that were left
 
05:24:13.628 --> 05:24:13.638 align:start position:0%
out that we were not happy with um and
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear that things like the
 
05:24:17.788 --> 05:24:17.798 align:start position:0%
annulment we can work on and we're happy
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
to provide our feedback um but would
 
05:24:23.470 --> 05:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
just really urge the committee to
 
05:24:26.590 --> 05:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
consider what is likely um to actually
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
get enacted into law because I I you
 
05:24:32.910 --> 05:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:35.708 --> 05:24:35.718 align:start position:0%
um the the way in which these the
 
05:24:38.390 --> 05:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
existing prohibitions affect real people
 
05:24:40.948 --> 05:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
in our community is serious and that's
 
05:24:43.510 --> 05:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
what I bring to work every day
 
05:24:46.350 --> 05:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
and it's it's just so important that we
 
05:24:48.110 --> 05:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
come together and work together to get
 
05:24:50.190 --> 05:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
something actually done this year um and
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
I look forward to to working with all
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
the folks in the room in the coming
 
05:24:56.150 --> 05:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
weeks I know that you're short on time
 
05:24:58.110 --> 05:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
um and and I really hope that we can get
 
05:25:00.470 --> 05:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
to a place where we have language that
 
05:25:02.510 --> 05:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
we can move forward with so I just thank
 
05:25:06.310 --> 05:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
you chairman so but annulment was not in
 
05:25:07.750 --> 05:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
here is that is that correct is not and
 
05:25:10.150 --> 05:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
I can provide language that I can take
 
05:25:11.788 --> 05:25:11.798 align:start position:0%
from previous versions and I will send
 
05:25:15.430 --> 05:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
them to representative Le yep yes uh uh
 
05:25:16.548 --> 05:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
we do have a question if you're willing
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
to it's just a comment a general comment
 
05:25:20.708 --> 05:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
comment to every um yeah so whatever we
 
05:25:23.548 --> 05:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
do in the house we we can only negotiate
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
with the senate in committee conference
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
on things that we put into the bill
 
05:25:29.708 --> 05:25:29.718 align:start position:0%
right so we want to be we want to put in
 
05:25:31.548 --> 05:25:31.558 align:start position:0%
everything that we we would like to
 
05:25:34.190 --> 05:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
negotiate with during committee
 
05:25:37.110 --> 05:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
conference um my other thought was when
 
05:25:38.670 --> 05:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment's done if there could be a
 
05:25:40.230 --> 05:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
onepage summary of the different
 
05:25:42.110 --> 05:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
sections or a walk through so where
 
05:25:44.070 --> 05:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
you'll understand what we're voting on
 
05:25:46.590 --> 05:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:48.910 --> 05:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
helpful okay so I've just sent it
 
05:25:53.708 --> 05:25:53.718 align:start position:0%
anybody here can did you get it
 
05:25:56.910 --> 05:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
Nita you got it
 
05:25:59.548 --> 05:25:59.558 align:start position:0%
okay all right represent can we make
 
05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
that can you make that available to all
 
05:26:03.470 --> 05:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
of us
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:10.788 --> 05:26:10.798 align:start position:0%
okay and just for everybody to
 
05:26:12.830 --> 05:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
understand why I didn't bother passing
 
05:26:14.910 --> 05:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
why I you know never thought to send
 
05:26:18.830 --> 05:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
this to everyone is what I got was an
 
05:26:23.510 --> 05:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to the original Bill and so
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:29.600 --> 05:26:32.670 align:start position:0%
 
gobbly

05:26:32.670 --> 05:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:32.680 --> 05:26:35.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:26:35.948 --> 05:26:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
scrolling the attachment didn't come
 
05:26:41.948 --> 05:26:41.958 align:start position:0%
through okay so I I I this is the
 
05:26:43.628 --> 05:26:43.638 align:start position:0%
problems of trying this is why I don't
 
05:26:46.230 --> 05:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
use my phone to do these things so when
 
05:26:48.150 --> 05:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
I get home I'll send it to you but I
 
05:26:50.030 --> 05:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
just want you to know it's going to be
 
05:26:50.040 --> 05:26:51.548 align:start position:0%
just want you to know it's going to be
goblook

05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
goblook
 
05:26:54.788 --> 05:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
because it's a an amendment that was
 
05:26:59.190 --> 05:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
based on another bill different bill
 
05:27:01.030 --> 05:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
number shows
 
05:27:03.310 --> 05:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
tendy so
 
05:27:07.150 --> 05:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
so over star it was the 639 so it was
 
05:27:08.830 --> 05:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment to
 
05:27:15.590 --> 05:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
639 so it was it's that's that's um so
 
05:27:18.150 --> 05:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
um like I would say is if you want to
 
05:27:19.510 --> 05:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
see what was in
 
05:27:22.670 --> 05:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
it then this amendment that I you have
 
05:27:26.708 --> 05:27:26.718 align:start position:0%
now in your hand is so but I want I what
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
I want to see is what did they
 
05:27:32.510 --> 05:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
specifically not like and that
 
05:27:35.590 --> 05:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
was didn't
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
correct didn't come that evidently the
 
05:27:41.350 --> 05:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
attachment didn't come through
 
05:27:44.110 --> 05:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
so it didn't didn't
 
05:27:47.910 --> 05:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
open okay so I I again I it's trying to
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
use your phone as a computer is hopeless
 
05:27:52.510 --> 05:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
um I actually do have a crosswalk
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
between 639 and 1633 that I can send to
 
05:27:57.350 --> 05:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
the committee I thought it was just too
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
much information but now I think that'll
 
05:28:01.070 --> 05:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
help merge theion out to everybody
 
05:28:04.110 --> 05:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
that'd be great thank you appreciate it
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
so okay so we'll wait till next Tuesday
 
05:28:10.948 --> 05:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
and see where we are Wednesday excuse me
 
05:28:12.948 --> 05:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
actually I haven't scheduled it at
 
05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
all what would you rather what would you
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
rather do Tuesday or
 
05:28:19.150 --> 05:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
Wednesday because we have a session on
 
05:28:20.868 --> 05:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
Thursday so we were just supposed to
 
05:28:24.190 --> 05:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
meet Wednesday I was basically I was I
 
05:28:26.548 --> 05:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
was planning on having a day for you
 
05:28:28.510 --> 05:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
know a subcommittee day and then
 
05:28:31.110 --> 05:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
executive in the afternoon thinking that
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
we we actually have some bills we're
 
05:28:35.590 --> 05:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
ready to exec now because we we did we
 
05:28:38.070 --> 05:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
did get some stuff so I was thinking
 
05:28:40.830 --> 05:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
wday that Tuesday we would do hearings
 
05:28:42.868 --> 05:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we would do subcommittees in
 
05:28:44.430 --> 05:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
the morning the ones the three that we
 
05:28:47.230 --> 05:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
have left over and then exec in the
 
05:28:50.350 --> 05:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon and then thir next Wednesday
 
05:28:53.070 --> 05:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
and then Thursday is I believe is a
 
05:28:56.310 --> 05:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
session day
 
05:29:00.990 --> 05:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
so but what Carrie sent out was
 
05:29:03.430 --> 05:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
hearings on Wednesday and nothing else
 
05:29:04.910 --> 05:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
oh okay well then the subcommittee will
 
05:29:05.868 --> 05:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
be on
 
05:29:07.990 --> 05:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday but there was nothing about
 
05:29:11.150 --> 05:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and what she I understand
 
05:29:14.990 --> 05:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
she sent out hearings for next Wednesday
 
05:29:18.150 --> 05:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
so therefore the subcommittees will be
 
05:29:20.548 --> 05:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday and you haven't got the
 
05:29:22.990 --> 05:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
notification yet because I haven't told
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
her thank you I we have a lot of stuff
 
05:29:29.628 --> 05:29:29.638 align:start position:0%
scheduled for we we' postponed a number
 
05:29:31.070 --> 05:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
of bills
 
05:29:33.270 --> 05:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
but we told some people specifically
 
05:29:34.430 --> 05:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
that they would be coming back on
 
05:29:37.110 --> 05:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I and I am surprised she sent
 
05:29:39.230 --> 05:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
that out Wednesday but I like you know
 
05:29:41.070 --> 05:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
but what am I going to tell someone like
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
I could well I could tell you what if
 
05:29:45.510 --> 05:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
you think that's a problem I will cancel
 
05:29:47.470 --> 05:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
all those bills on Wednesday and move
 
05:29:50.590 --> 05:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
them to Tuesday which one which is which
 
05:29:53.070 --> 05:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
is worse I think that might be better
 
05:29:56.628 --> 05:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
because look we told Karen uh uh
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative eel for instance to have
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
everything ready on Wednesday now we hav
 
05:30:02.868 --> 05:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
told her that it's going to be Tuesday I
 
05:30:04.628 --> 05:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
and this will be the second time I will
 
05:30:06.910 --> 05:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
cancel everything that's on Wednesday
 
05:30:08.670 --> 05:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
that you guys seem to have gotten yeah
 
05:30:10.548 --> 05:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
it's easy enough and then and have that
 
05:30:13.470 --> 05:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
scheduled for Tuesday so Wednesday
 
05:30:15.548 --> 05:30:15.558 align:start position:0%
morning we'll be doing the three bills
 
05:30:17.788 --> 05:30:17.798 align:start position:0%
that we have left over and then
 
05:30:19.830 --> 05:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
Wednesday afternoon we'll EXA what we
 
05:30:23.548 --> 05:30:23.558 align:start position:0%
have at that time that works and then um
 
05:30:25.670 --> 05:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
and then and then we'll I believe
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
Thursday is supposed to be a session
 
05:30:33.628 --> 05:30:33.638 align:start position:0%
day yeah I you know so okay so basically

with it no just like
 
05:32:16.958 --> 05:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
with it no just like
time

05:32:29.030 --> 05:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.040 --> 05:32:35.868 align:start position:0%
 
February

05:32:35.868 --> 05:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:38.150 --> 05:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
did did you did you say you have to
 
05:32:39.830 --> 05:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
chair your committee on Wednesday so
 
05:32:41.110 --> 05:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
having the subcommittee on Wednesday
 
05:32:42.590 --> 05:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
would be bad for
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
you yes I I will be my chairman um has a
 
05:32:48.548 --> 05:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
doctor's appointment and so I was going
 
05:32:50.830 --> 05:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
to be chairing some of Wednesday did we
 
05:32:52.350 --> 05:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
have the subcommittee on Tuesday that's
 
05:32:53.708 --> 05:32:53.718 align:start position:0%
what it sounded like or we switched it
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
to Wednesday think it just got that's
 
05:32:57.788 --> 05:32:57.798 align:start position:0%
why I called
 
05:33:04.510 --> 05:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:07.070 --> 05:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
if in in the afternoon after what you're
 
05:33:07.080 --> 05:33:09.948 align:start position:0%
if in in the afternoon after what you're
already

05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:11.750 --> 05:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
rescheduling okay if that works
 
05:33:13.510 --> 05:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise I can have somebody else step
 
05:33:15.070 --> 05:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
into the role we're not exec on
 
05:33:18.150 --> 05:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
Wednesday so I I was offering that I
 
05:33:20.750 --> 05:33:20.760 align:start position:0%

05:33:26.230 --> 05:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:26.240 --> 05:33:27.990 align:start position:0%
