election day uh I do not know whether
 
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 align:start position:0%

hearings here at the capital on that day
 
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have the schedule for next
 
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
week's schedule at this point in time so
 
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
that I will get that to you as soon as I
 
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 align:start position:0%

river in Vermont today so I got all the
 
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
grandkids at the house so I had my usual
 
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
three hours of sleep
 
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
and um the um elections coming up for us
 
00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday for mpal elections um so I'm
 
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and one other thing I
 
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
want to note I do have a copy of
 
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 and that's the policy uh statement
 
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
which supports hb1 it's not to finance
 
00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh I've been asked by finance division
 
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
two to look at the issue of mining
 
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.390 align:start position:0%
two to look at the issue of mining
postsecondary

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
postsecondary
 
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
institutions uh here in New Hampshire
 
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
Community College and the postsecondary
 
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
university system New Hampshire uh I'm
 
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
putting together a subcommittee I've
 
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
notified those subcommittee members that
 
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
are on that committee uh that we will be
 
00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
doing a r a rush in terms of looking
 
00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
This research and looking at um and
 
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
developing a brief not taking any kind
 
00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
of position but just identifying the
 
00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
facts that
 
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
exist and and trying to get that
 
00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
together by the close of this month
 
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
um that when they have to start taking
 
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
up hb2 in finance so it's a real tight
 
00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 align:start position:0%
schedule all the way around those folks
 
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
which will be on that myself
 
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
representative mopet and representative
 
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.550 align:start position:0%
representative mopet and representative
um

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 align:start position:0%
board on the on the Democratic side we
 
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
have representative Miler representative
 
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
luno and representative
 
00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
Ellison you know talked with all six
 
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
people that's including myself I talk
 
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
myself often um the um issue here is not
 
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
a partisan issue of any kind the issue
 
00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 align:start position:0%
is our postsecondary education so that's
 
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
why I have three members and three
 
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
members on there this is a a neutral
 
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 align:start position:0%
committee is trying to look at the
 
00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 align:start position:0%
issues associated with combining into
 
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
one set of Trustees for the entire
 
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
system getting away from the two
 
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
trustees system we have now and looking
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
at all those Associated issues that are
 
00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
related to combining they're huge it's a
 
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
huge issue
 
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we can help Finance out
 
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'll take some questions on that a
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
little later on uh today uh when we have
 
00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 align:start position:0%

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
session as House Bill
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
1127 this committee unanimously passed
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
it it went through the Full House on a
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
Voice vote and like so many of our
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
initiatives last year became a victim of
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
covid-19 there are two primary
 
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
components of House Bill
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
202 the first is a guarantee that any
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
student who is unable to pay for their
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
school lunch is not to be stigmatized by
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
being offered an alternative uh meal
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
selection that is unavailable on a daily
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
basis as part of the regular me meal
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
program the second component has to do
 
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
with communication between school and
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
Home in that um the bill spells out that
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
any communication about unpaid balances
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
needs to take place between school
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
personnel and the parents and not
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
involve the kids in the discussion about
 
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not they have a delinquent
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
account um the meal itself uh has to
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
follow the guidelines that are outlined
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
by school nutrition program
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
standards but uh at the moment those
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
meals are only offered to Elementary
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
students I believe that it's
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan's intent that this
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
also apply to middle school and high
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
school students as well last session uh
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
those of you that were on the Comm
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
committee remember my discussion about
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
the cheese sandwich it was a Hallmark
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
moment for House Education when we
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
talked about the fact that there are in
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
it places where kids who don't have
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
enough money in their account or who are
 
00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:32.839 align:start position:0%
in AAR are being offered food choices
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
that cause them either some source of
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
embarrassment or limit the quality of
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
the lunch that they're being given or uh
 
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
stigmatize them in that when you leave
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
the lunch line and you've got your
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
cheese sandwich on your tray and
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
everybody else is having lasagna with
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
garlic bread and salad then people know
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
that your lunch account is uh in the red
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
because you're leaving the lunch line
 
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
with the cheese
 
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
sandwich uh regarding the communication
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
between home and school the bill does
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
make a provision for kids to be able to
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
discreetly be given notices uh I.E if a
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
letter needs to go home then a student
 
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
can be asked to tuck the letter into
 
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
their backpack and take the letter home
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
to the parent but what we're trying to
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
avoid uh with this bill as I mentioned
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
earlier is the direct conversation you
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
know in the lunch line with 150 other
 
00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519 align:start position:0%
kids around about why you don't have
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
enough money in your lunch account to
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
pay for your meal that day um I know
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%

a quick question if I recall last year
 
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
under the parameters of the bill we
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
talked about the ID and the Stig stigma
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
that students um were uh not allowed in
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
the future although it had been
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
happening in the past to do any school
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
work help the custodian paint the wall
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
or is that is that the intent of that ID
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
sensation in this in this generic part
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
of you Bill yeah thank you so much
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock for bringing
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
that up um yes that that is still a
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
component of the bill what it basically
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
says is that schools are uh should not
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
put a student in the position of trying
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
to work off their debt however it does
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
not prevent students from doing work
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
around the school if that's part of the
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
ordinary everyday operational uh sure
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
way that the school does things so in
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
other words if in lunchrooms if kids
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
wipe down tables they can do that as
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%

RSA uh is to ensure that um any meal
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is offered to a child um can be
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
offered to every single child in the the
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
school so um for example uh there are
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
times when a child may actually want a
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
uh sun butter and jelly sandwich or a
 
00:16:11.319 --> 00:16:12.350 align:start position:0%
uh sun butter and jelly sandwich or a
cheese

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
cheese
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
sandwich and um they uh are now able to
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
because that has become an alternative
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
now within the school they are now able
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
to make that choice so all children can
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
make the choice to have um you know a
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
cheese sandwich or a sun butter and
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
jelly sandwich that was that was uh also
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
a component of of that particular bill
 
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
so I did want to point that out as far
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
as working off a debt um I'm a little
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
concerned by hearing that uh because I
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
do not know of any food service
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
operations that are requiring children
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
to work off a debt this is not something
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
that uh the federal uh component of this
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
through USD a allows either so I am
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
concerned about that um and if if that
 
00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
is happening uh we would need to know
 
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.829 align:start position:0%
is happening uh we would need to know
that

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
immediately um and then uh you know
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
again the
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
stigmatization um this is something that
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
we also uh always watch out for USDA
 
00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
does not um allow that they have manuals
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
that we uh train to and provide to the
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
field um and those manuals um uh do uh
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
talk about all of the particular things
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
that uh that were just discussed by the
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
representative um but I just wanted to
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
add those things in there because I just
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure that you knew that
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
there was already an RSA in place we
 
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
already do a lot of Education and
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
Training in this area um and you know uh
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
we are glad to do any more that's needed
 
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh there is that one particular
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
piece that I just heard that is
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
concerning to me um because I do not
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
know of any school that is making a
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
child work off a
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.310 align:start position:0%
 
for

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
repus represent Rec you have a
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
question yes I was wondering if then you
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary well I I
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
um to uh say that potentially yes um I
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
was just looking at it and and um I do
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
have to say too that uh representative
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
Horgan had called me
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
um before he uh wrote it um and before
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
he presented it to you all um and at
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
that time I did um tell him that I had
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
some concerns that it was redundant to
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh the existing um
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
RSA so um that that was something that I
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
did um speak with him
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
about so uh you know I I I think that
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's probably a um a fair question and
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes any further questions I don't see
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you Miss
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
White and
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
T I don't see anybody with their hand
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
raised looks like
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh we got to close the session on house
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
122 thank you and oh um You probably
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
wna no I don't know if anybody can hear

be testifying for the bill that is
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct representative bone
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead please okay thank you
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh good morning again and on behalf of
 
00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
Representative forgan I'm here to
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
introduce to you house bill
 
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.160 align:start position:0%
203 House Bill 203 also had a uh prior
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
life it was House Bill 1681 in our last
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
session and uh it had a bit of an
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
evolutionary arrival to the committee
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
the last time that representative Horgan
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh presented this bill it it started its
 
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
life as a bill to look at whether or not
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
breakfast should also be offered in
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
addition to lunch to free and reduced
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire but by the
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
time we got done discussing the issue we
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
had more questions than we had
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
answers uh we had questions about
 
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not all public schools were
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
utilizing similar resources we had
 
00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
questions about whether or not um
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
practices were consistent from school
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
district to school district we wondered
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not there were private
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
schools out there that had meals
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
programs that were doing things in a way
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
that we might learn something
 
00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
so the bill ultimately was amended to
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
move from being a breakfast for free and
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
reduced students to a study committee of
 
00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
Food Services practices in New Hampshire
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
so representative Horgan has resurrected
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
this bill once again W is requesting
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
that a study committee be put together
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
to uh look
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
at the array of practices that are
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
taking place in New Hampshire and uh
 
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
while he acknowledges that we may not be
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
able to do do you know a thorough and
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
comprehensive study in the time allotted
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
to the bill um the he's hoping that the
 
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee will prioritize its questions
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
and be productive
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
you representative boam are you out
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:35.109 align:start position:0%
you representative boam are you out
there

00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
I am not hearing
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
anything is anybody hearing
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%

program we would be more than happy to

any so I'll I'll have one there is do
 
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
you know of any problems across the
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
state with glaring differences between
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
school lunch programs one district and
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.470 align:start position:0%
school lunch programs one district and
another

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
so the way that a food service program
 
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.150 align:start position:0%
so the way that a food service program
is

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
implemented um can be can be
 
00:50:33.119 --> 00:50:34.710 align:start position:0%
implemented um can be can be
different

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
um as far as um the uh regulations and
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
speaking to the
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
regulations they all have to be in place
 
00:50:47.789 --> 00:50:47.799 align:start position:0%
um it's just how they Implement their
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
program in order to meet the uh
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
regulations so that's that's the biggest
 
00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.430 align:start position:0%
regulations so that's that's the biggest
um

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
difference uh but by and large we see
 
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
some consistent pieces as well to the
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
way that uh food service is implemented
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
um right now however of course during
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
covid I'm talking about normal times
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
during covid we're all over the place um
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
with implementation and strategies and
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
and really um uh it that is all based on
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
the resources that they have to be able
 
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:23.799 align:start position:0%
to feed uh the children in the different
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
ways that Co is requiring that they feed
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
children at this point in
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%

01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
minute John all Mr Janan our
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative Janan
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
your your you've been promoted please go
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
ahead gosh thank you um for the record
 
01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
I'm representative John janigian
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham District 8 which
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
is Salem New Hampshire um here to
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
introduce uh HB
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
422 and um has a um fairly small change
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
there's already a requirement to
 
01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
um have a half credit course in Civics
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's already a state requirement and one
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that um I've noticed and
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
in many of my constituents have noticed
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
and other people I've talked to around
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
the state is that for some reason a lot
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
of uh younger people however that may be
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
defined um uh you know up into maybe 30s
 
01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
and and so forth don't seem to have a
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
strong knowledge of um Civics and and
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
how our surprisingly how our federal
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
state or local governments work and we
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
already have this state requirement of a
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
half crit course um but what 422 does is
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
it says that half crit course must be a
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
distinct course because because right
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
now um it can be satisfied by taking
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
other courses and you know whether
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh that may be causing a problem
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
so so this bill proposes to make it a uh
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
Standalone course and for those towns
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
that I did get some feedback that some
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
smaller towns uh may be concerned with
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
having to create course material so
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph three starting at line 16 of
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
the bill um addresses that by saying
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
that uh the new Hampshire um um
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education will put
 
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
together a course outline um using a
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
committee of New Hampshire Educators to
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
create a sample curriculum so that
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much the bill and that's
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
the um the reason for it and um Mr
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
Campbell I think will be will be
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
speaking with some more information
 
01:15:46.159 --> 01:15:47.270 align:start position:0%
speaking with some more information
thank

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much are there any uh
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
questions for the sponsor of the bill
 
01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:54.950 align:start position:0%
questions for the sponsor of the bill
yes

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question is
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
there any reason why you uh require this
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
in grade 10 and 11 and 12
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
only um the issue was I think in talking
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
to people that when you get into that
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
11th and 12th grade area you are getting
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
you either are at voting age or you're
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
close to voting age and the issue is
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
making sure that you know students take
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
this um you know as something important
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
I think if you start possibly at too
 
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
young an age I mean this doesn't stop a
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
school district from teaching it at a
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
younger age
 
01:16:38.629 --> 01:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
um this this half credit course is a
 
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
high school course but you know if it
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
want if people in communities want to
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
teach it sooner that's that's fine but
 
01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
we just thought that uh I'm open to
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
suggestions on that but that was the the
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank thank you just one more question
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
if we already have um a one credit
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
course and you're going to add this
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
additional one credit course um to local
 
01:17:07.679 --> 01:17:08.990 align:start position:0%
additional one credit course um to local
graduation

01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
requirements uh does that mean you're
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to reduce the existing history
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
course from one to a half so we aren't
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
adding more
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
requirements um no this this isn't
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
adding any requirements it's it's
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
actually one half credit it's a half
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
credit course in Civics that is
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
currently required all we're saying is
 
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
that half credit course must be a
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
standalone course now and cannot be
 
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
satisfied by taking other courses and
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
saying okay you've satisfied so there's
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
no increase in in the number of credits
 
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
required only that that half credit
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
course in Civics be a standalone course
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
just just final question Mr L if I may
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
if if this if the requirement of the RSA
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
already requires one credit in US
 
01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
history and you're adding a half credit
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
even though you're D reducing some of
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
the curricular from the one credit
 
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
course that still means it's a one and a
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
half credits for graduation as I
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
understand it you not agree I'm not sure
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
I maybe I'm not explaining it correctly
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
there there's the requirement is a half
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
Credit cour in Civics uh must be taken
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
it can be satisfied by current law by
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
taking other courses to satisfy it um so
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is so that have Credit in Civics is
 
01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:25.870 align:start position:0%
this is so that have Credit in Civics is
still

01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
required um it's just that it's it's got
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
to be a standalone
 
01:18:33.629 --> 01:18:33.639 align:start position:0%
course thank you for members of the
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
committee we do have a technical support
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education in the
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum area Mr Green is here uh so
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
if you have some specific questions
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
regarding that maybe it's perhaps better
 
01:18:48.669 --> 01:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
that you address them to the department
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
they may be able to give you a straight
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
answer in terms of what is being done
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
done right
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
now represent Tanner do you have a a
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
question yes I do and I I don't know if
 
01:19:04.830 --> 01:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
it'd be better for Mr Green or uh the
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative um it's about the
 
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
performance-based assessments that we
 
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire whether um this
 
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum and and the fact that it's a
 
01:19:18.669 --> 01:19:18.679 align:start position:0%
course is just seat time with a test and
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
not uh precludes performance-based
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.870 align:start position:0%
not uh precludes performance-based
assessments

01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
is that towards the representative or
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
are you saying maybe we should be asking
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
the department I think may I think maybe
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
the department thank you
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh Ellison you have your hand up I do
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh and thank you
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
given the requirements in the in the
 
01:19:48.719 --> 01:19:49.870 align:start position:0%
given the requirements in the in the
actual

01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
actual
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
bill is there any difference between
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
the uh requirements in the bill and
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
what's already in the RSA which requires
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
a one credit course in US history in New
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
Ham us and New Hampshire history and a
 
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
half Credit in US New Hampshire
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.510 align:start position:0%
 
Civics

01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
Civics
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
um the I think the the the issue is the
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
the history courses I think the problem
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
is resulting and and you know I think
 
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
when Mr Campbell speaks he can speak
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
more um accurately about this but the
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
problem seems to be that that half
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
credit course is being sat in Civics is
 
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
being satisfied through the history
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
courses but perhaps not adequately
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
because we do see so many young people
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
who don't seem to have a strong
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
understanding in in federal state and
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
local government operations so that
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's the again that's the impetus to
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
this thank you thank you at this time
 
01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:55.639 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna uh look next to have Mr Green
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
come on and from the Department of
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
Education and I I believe many of your
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
questions can be directed to
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
him uh Mr Green are you there he's here
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I am good morning good morning how
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
can you help
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
us sure so just to provide a little bit
 
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
of clarification because it sounded like
 
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
there was a couple of questions around
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
the credit requirements So currently
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
there is a one full credit requirement
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the US American history
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
and a half credit requirement in Civics
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
those are both required for graduation
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
currently under New Hampshire state law
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
so the changes in this bill would not
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
change graduation requirements in any
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
way as a department sees it um because
 
01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
there's already a one and a half credit
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
requirement so the bill appears to be
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
just clarifying some of the language
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
around that um it's not adding any
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
additional graduation requirements onto
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
what we currently
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
require um the way that curriculum works
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
with with required graduation courses is
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
a school district generally determines
 
01:21:59.629 --> 01:21:59.639 align:start position:0%
what are the specific competencies based
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
on the content that has been required
 
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Education so in
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
this case the half credit course in
 
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
Civics has some pretty specific uh
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
components to the curriculum that are
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
already outlined in 18911 so school
 
01:22:15.149 --> 01:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
districts would be required to have that
 
01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
within their half credit course in
 
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
Civics um I think what the
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative is referring to is
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes school districts will take
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
that Civics course and they'll embed
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
that into a larger course that might be
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
a full credit and so the half credit
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
component of civics is being met by a
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
student who's taking a full credit
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
course that includes content going
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
Beyond just the minimum Civics
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
requirements so my understanding is that
 
01:22:44.189 --> 01:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
the new language in this bill would
 
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
require that half credit Civics course
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
to be its own Standalone course and not
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
to be embedded within a larger course is
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative Jen do you have a
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
response to that yes I I would agree
 
01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.110 align:start position:0%
response to that yes I I would agree
with

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
what Mr Green just
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
said then Mr Green can you please
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
explain to us what type of forces are
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
in um I think it would depend on the
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
school district itself I think it's a
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
small percentage of districts that are
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
embeding it in a larger course uh the
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
majority of school districts offer
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
Civics as a standalone half credit
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
course right now um I have seen some
 
01:23:33.149 --> 01:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
school districts embedded along with an
 
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
English course and so they include um a
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
broader look at Humanities as well so
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
the Civics might be embedded in there
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
along with English and Ela competencies
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
and again that takes a course from being
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
a half credit to a full credit course um
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
because they're not only just doing the
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
Civics pieces but they're also looking
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
at broader Humanities topics within the
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
course it's really District specific um
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
and to be honest I couldn't tell you off
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
the top of my head um a district that is
 
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
doing that currently but you know
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the rules right now
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
that precludes a district from doing
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
that represent Tanner did you have a
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
Department yeah my um thank you chairman
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
lad my question was about the
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
performance-based assessments where if
 
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
this if the state department writing uh
 
01:24:27.629 --> 01:24:27.639 align:start position:0%
curriculum um are they going to is there
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.669 align:start position:0%
going to be
some

01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
um at least some effort to include
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
performance-based assessments where
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
students actually use and apply the the
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh knowledge that they learn um rather
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
test yes so uh any kind of technical
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
assistance that we provide to districts
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
from a a curriculum and instruction
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
perspective um includes a focus on
 
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
Competency Based education and
 
01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
performance-based assessments um we've
 
01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
really moved in that direction as a
 
01:25:05.109 --> 01:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
state um and I think we've done so in a
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
really Innovative way over the last 10
 
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
years um our focus in the state really
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
is on encouraging students to attain
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
Mastery of the competencies in a course
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
through a variety of Assessments um that
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
includes paper and pencil based tests
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
but it also includes Hands-On learning
 
01:25:24.189 --> 01:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
it includes performance-based tasks and
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
assessments um because we've seen that
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's really the best way to get at
 
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:29.639 align:start position:0%
understanding the broad knowledge that
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
students possess within a particular
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
course I will say though anytime the
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
department engages in work that's
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
specific to curriculum and instruction
 
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
it's generally done as a way of
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
providing guidance towards districts
 
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
it's a way of providing assistance to
 
01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:47.719 align:start position:0%
districts but curriculum and instruction
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
really Falls within the realm and
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
purview of the local school board and so
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
we can Pro provide documents we can
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
provide guidance um but often times that
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
has to be adopted by the local school
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
board as well because curriculum
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
Authority Ellison is your hand up for
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
for yes it is yes it is uh thank you Mr
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and Nate thanks for taking my
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
question I just want to be be sure I'm
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
clear on the description that you gave
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
which I think was that all the elements
 
01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
of requirements of a Civics course even
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
if they're put into a larger course have
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
fulfilled yes that is correct so under
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
the current law that we have if you
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
embed a Civics course in a larger course
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
it still has to have all of the required
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
elements of a course even if it was
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
taught as a standalone course those
 
01:26:47.790 --> 01:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
competencies have to be the
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr Green I got a question sort of a
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
followup to represent woodcock's
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
question that was brought up earlier the
 
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
legislation says this one half credit
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
course shall be a distinct course
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
separate from other history courses and
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
required in the Junior and Senior year
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
so do we have schools out there right
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
now that are teaching Civics in the
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
ninth and the 10th grade and but this
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
says it's going to have to be down in
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
the 11th or 12th grade as it's
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
written yes we do have schools that
 
01:27:27.270 --> 01:27:27.280 align:start position:0%
teach Civics across 9 through 12 um so
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
there are some schools that are offering
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
it to freshmen um there's some students
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
who take it in their 10th grade year
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a student that might take it
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
in their senior year has done so because
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
there were issues in their schedule in
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
their n9th or 10th or 11th grade year
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
where they were trying to take other
 
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
courses and it just didn't fit within
 
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
their schedule and it gets pushed
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
towards their senior year um but right
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
now we don't have a requirement on the
 
01:27:51.550 --> 01:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
grade level and so it varies widely
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
across the St State thank you are there
 
01:27:56.189 --> 01:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
further questions of the department
 
01:27:56.199 --> 01:27:57.229 align:start position:0%
further questions of the department
Mullen

01:27:57.229 --> 01:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
Mullen
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
has thank you very much Mr chair um
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Green for taking my
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
question uh when you talk about these
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
courses that have Civics embedded within
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
them uh would an AP class or uh an IB
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
class be examples of a course that might
 
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
have the Civics competencies embedded in
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
existing one credit
 
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
courses they could but that's generally
 
01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
not the case because the Civics courses
 
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
are required to have a focus not just on
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
us Civics and um citizenship but as well
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire and AP and IB courses
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
tend not to have a New Hampshire
 
01:28:44.109 --> 01:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
specific Focus so if a teacher were to
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
embed Civics into a course like that
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
they would have to go beyond the
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
traditional AP curriculum to ensure that
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
there is a New Hampshire Focus as well
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
well being taught in that course right
 
01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:55.710 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:57.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
[Music]

01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much are there we
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
have some other folks that are waiting
 
01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:03.639 align:start position:0%
to testify are there any more questions
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
department Mr Green are you gonna hang
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
loose here throughout this
 
01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
discussion I will yeah
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay so we'd like to have next uh
 
01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.990 align:start position:0%
yes okay so we'd like to have next uh

Campbell okay I just promoted um Mr
 
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.350 --> 01:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
please thank you uh thank you very much
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman honorable members of the
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh education committee uh my name is
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
Bernie Campbell and I'm a social studies
 
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
teacher at Salem High School uh
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative jenan recently reached
 
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
out to one of my colleagues uh seeking
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
input on this proposed bill and she
 
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
graciously included me on that
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
conversation uh as this is something
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
that I have been very passionate about
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
over the last several years uh I believe
 
01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
that it's very important that Civics
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
education be given a separate emphasis
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
within the curriculum uh in many
 
01:30:08.189 --> 01:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
districts um Civics is included as a
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
component of an American history class
 
01:30:12.189 --> 01:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
well this might seem to be a natural fit
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
the reality is that combining these two
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
requirements is not as efficient as one
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
might think it what changes both
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
subjects Civics is only covered in the
 
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
most basic sense while history content
 
01:30:23.709 --> 01:30:23.719 align:start position:0%
is squeezed to make room for civics
 
01:30:25.390 --> 01:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
requiring Civics as a separate class
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
will free up space within history
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
classes as well as giving more space to
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
take a longer look at Civics instruction
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
to include time for more practical
 
01:30:34.510 --> 01:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
Hands-On activities like mock
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
legislatures mood courts and
 
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
participatory experiences like observing
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
local government in action while it's
 
01:30:41.950 --> 01:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
true that I would say that most New
 
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School students can
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
indeed name their governor and their
 
01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
full Congressional
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
delegations uh few could name more than
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
a handful of their own state
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
representatives or members of their
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
local city council or select boards few
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
would even be aware of the role of other
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
local boards such as budget committees
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
or land use boards which arguably have
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
an even greater direct impact on their
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
lives than their representatives in
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
Washington uh it was my hope that this
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill would explicitly require the class
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the senior year it's my belief that
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
this class is most impactful the closer
 
01:31:13.229 --> 01:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
students are to turning 18 and obtaining
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
their full rights I understand that uh
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
representative and his fellow sponsors
 
01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
felt that giving the flexibility to
 
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
offer in the junior year might Aid uh
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
school districts and I respect that
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
offering any earlier than that is not in
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
my experience as useful for sophomores
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
students who are mainly 15 and 16 years
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
old these concepts are still too
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
abstract too far away to concern them
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
it's a class that's more effective for
 
01:31:37.109 --> 01:31:37.119 align:start position:0%
the older grades who are about to take
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
their first steps into adulthood there's
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
no doubt in my mind that this bill would
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
improve the Civics education of all
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
students exiting New Hampshire's high
 
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
schools I believe very strongly that the
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
events of the last few years have proven
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
that more needs to be done to educate
 
01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
students on the functions of government
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
so they're better prepared to be
 
01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:53.719 align:start position:0%
responsible informed citizens when they
 
01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
turn 18 thank you for your time ladies
 
01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
and gentlemen and I hope you will
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
recommend passage of this Bill thank you
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions for Mr
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
Campbell yes represent Woodcock thank
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
you representative lad Mr Campbell just
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
a question I hear your your comments
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
about the the necessity of changing the
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
curricula have you brought that to your
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
local school board and asked them to do
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
it um we've had some conversations
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
around adjusting our uh curriculum uh
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
those conversations have not yet proven
 
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
fruitful thank you thank you Mr lad are
 
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
there further
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions oh yeah repr bone thank you Mr
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
question in small school
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
districts it's sometimes impossible
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
for students especially up at the top
 
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
level to fit in all the re the classes
 
01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
that they need and by requiring that
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
don't you think that requiring this in
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
just the last two years of high school
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
will put a problem on those students
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
coures thank you uh representative I to
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
your point I think that there's enough
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility in scheduling to allow this
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh even in within smaller school
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
districts uh half credit class is um you
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
know in a block schedule it's only 45
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
days in a uh in a regular schedule it's
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
only 9
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
so it's only a halfe course in a in a
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
regular schedule course or it's only a
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
45-day class in a block schedule I I
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily see that that's an
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
obstacle um even in a smaller School
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
District further questions thank you
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
very much Mr C thank you
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%

Carl lad speak I don't see him from the
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%

uh Dr Lad had registered to speak so I
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't prepared for an eloquent speech
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
as he might have been I believe he's
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
sitting in Senate Ed right now so but I
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%

01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
bom's uh concern about the impact on
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
smaller school districts uh we do feel
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
that this um does pose a a financial
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
obligation uh and also might impact
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
students ability to choose other courses
 
01:34:49.229 --> 01:34:49.239 align:start position:0%
because districts would be required to
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
have certain sections of specific
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
specifically Civics education uh which
 
01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
most do anyway um but also some of the
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
creative approaches to Humanities and uh
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
as uh Nate green pointed out those
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
components of civics education still
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
have to be included in the humanities
 
01:35:11.390 --> 01:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
course or in the United States history
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
version so we do feel that this um bill
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
is duplicative
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
and a financial obligation uh and is
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and as a result would
 
01:35:27.550 --> 01:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
request uh respectfully request in
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate for
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
this okay uh rep Tanner are there
 
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:36.189 align:start position:0%
this okay uh rep Tanner are there
further

01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
questions rep Tanner has hand rep Tanner
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
do you have your hand up yes I
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
do um and thank you Mr chair for
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
recognizing me uh and Mr Fu um would
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
having an extra requirement like this in
 
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
the Junior and Senior year interfere
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
with people uh students that are going
 
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:36:01.149 --> 01:36:01.159 align:start position:0%
CTE thank you for the thank you for the
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
question representative Tanner um and
 
01:36:05.550 --> 01:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
that is a great question because yes
 
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
every every restriction that you put on
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
um the schedule of a junior or senior um
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
in high school does impact other pieces
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
of their selection process and CTE could
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
certainly be impacted um for a halfe
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
course uh you know I look at the
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
experience with with kirar sending
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
students to conquered um for the CTE
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
programs in conquered when they do that
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
they miss travel time to get to and from
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
conquered and so the more restrictions
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
you put on the Junior and Senior year um
 
01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
the the more you impact a student
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
selection process so thank you for that
 
01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
for that great question and and just as
 
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
a former social studies teacher uh you
 
01:36:51.870 --> 01:36:51.880 align:start position:0%
must understand that I am all for Civics
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
education yay Bravo model un do it all
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
but we we have to be judicious in how we
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
invest our district resources and be
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
careful not to impose restrictions on
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
student selections thank you thank you
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
re L thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Fu for taking the question um I'm
 
01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
just it's just a followup here on what
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing from both yourself and
 
01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
I think from uh Mr Green from the
 
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed think you both confirm
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
for me did you both say that basically
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
most or the vast majority of school
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
districts are already offering this as a
 
01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:30.709 align:start position:0%
districts are already offering this as a
standalone

01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
course thank you for the question I
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
would defer to uh Nate green for the
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
specific of that answer it would be my
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
impression based on my knowledge of
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
being involved in um a number of school
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
districts throughout my 45y year career
 
01:37:48.910 --> 01:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
that the answer would be yes that um the
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
the course is already included in uh the
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
program of studies in in all high
 
01:37:55.589 --> 01:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
schools in the state in one fashion or
 
01:37:57.589 --> 01:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
another thank
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
you further questions I did promote Mr
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%

01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
there muted
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
yes morning here got a question for you
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
attorney Fon um where school districts
 
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
have Authority for instruction and
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum is this legislation going to
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
undermine local control or local school
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
board control their instruction and
 
01:38:49.119 --> 01:38:50.109 align:start position:0%
board control their instruction and
their

01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:38:50.119 --> 01:38:53.109 align:start position:0%
their
curriculum

01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
oh wow that's not a loaded question at
 
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:58.270 align:start position:0%
oh wow that's not a loaded question at
all

01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know if I can opine on
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would undermine it I I
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
think you have to look at it in totality
 
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
with the other requirements that are
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
imposed on a school district I don't
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
think I'm in a position to say whether
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
or not it would undermine local control
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
um I think you've heard from the
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
representative from doe to establish how
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
school districts are already structured
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
and how they're dealing with this
 
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
requirement already um and and I I don't
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
think I can go much further than than
 
01:39:30.669 --> 01:39:30.679 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion okay thank you are
 
01:39:33.870 --> 01:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
there other questions of attorney
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
F right thank you um who's next uh I
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%

ending this but it looks like we're
finished

with that uh we're going to conclude uh
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
this bill uh which is 422 deals with the
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
requirement of United States and and man
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government and
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
Civics uh how many people do we have
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
that signed up we have um 13 in support
 
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
13 in support four opposed four opposed
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%

testify along with support from the
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%

for you at the at the top of when we got
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.950 --> 01:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
19 um let me get my paper I think that's
 
01:41:49.589 --> 01:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
what I said yeah I think that's what
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
said I'm I'm showing that too so um so I
 
01:41:55.350 --> 01:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that and it looks
 
01:41:59.950 --> 01:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
like we've got one two after this week I
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
think I'm showing one two three four
 
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
eight bills still for or no seven bills
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
still for hearings see I came down with
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
six so
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
okay and what I also called arette
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
following when I went out there's a
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
possibility you may see that dat of the
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:25.639 align:start position:0%
right that won't be confirmed till late
 
01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:29.350 align:start position:0%
right that won't be confirmed till late
this

01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%

welcome those anyone who might be

watching from home to education
 
01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
committee to this hearing on a bill that
 
01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
actually focuses on education and
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge and
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh HB 319 simply asked that
 
01:45:11.629 --> 01:45:11.639 align:start position:0%
our Granite State college and university
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
public college and university graduates
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrated a basic Proficiency in
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
Civics fundamentals uh by simply passing
 
01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
the natural ation exam that we require
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
new citizens to study uh it's simple
 
01:45:29.629 --> 01:45:29.639 align:start position:0%
it's short and it's I think it is sweet
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh of course this proposed measure
 
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
raises questions as any bill should it's
 
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
why we're here so let me try to address
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
them quickly up front uh I have three of
 
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
them here number one is this assessment
 
01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
really needed and our my answer is
 
01:45:48.669 --> 01:45:48.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely data abounds that demonstrate
 
01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
the the rful lack of knowledge that our
 
01:45:53.189 --> 01:45:53.199 align:start position:0%
college graduates have in the way of
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
civics and history uh just Google the
 
01:45:58.669 --> 01:45:58.679 align:start position:0%
topic and you'll be probably horrified
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh that is if you think college
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
graduates should know something about
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
government if they're going to be good
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
citizens the recent National survey one
 
01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
of here's one of many many examples um a
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
recent National survey conducted by the
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
American Council of trustees and alumni
 
01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:19.719 align:start position:0%
it's called America's knowledge crisis a
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
survey on Civic
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
literacy uh the survey found shortfalls
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
in Americans knowledge of history and
 
01:46:28.589 --> 01:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
how our country
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
operates a poll of with thousand people
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
mostly college graduates found that 63%
 
01:46:37.229 --> 01:46:37.239 align:start position:0%
of respondents did not know the term
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
Links of US senators and and
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
representatives 20% in that survey
 
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
thought that Alexandria acasio Cortez
 
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
offed the New Deal no that was Franklin
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
Rosevelt uh maybe they thinking of the
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
green New Deal uh very
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
different uh I I was a college professor
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
for many years and I'd often throw in a
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
bonus extra credit Civics question at
 
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
the end of quizer exam students actually
 
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
look forward to these extra credit
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
questions there was no
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
penalty uh questions like who is your
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
Congress person many just did not know
 
01:47:15.910 --> 01:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
these are college students uh who is on
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
the $10 bill uh most would get that wwn
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
I know some of you watching from home
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
are thinking who is on a $10 bill and
 
01:47:28.030 --> 01:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to tell you uh if you look
 
01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
it up you'll remember it that's uh a
 
01:47:33.589 --> 01:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
little pedagogic thing there uh where
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
was the tree of
 
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
parasite some St St that WR who's Buri
 
01:47:40.990 --> 01:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
in Grant's Tom how get answers like the
 
01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
Unknown Soldier and the answer of course
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
is President Grant so anyway is the
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
Civics exam needed emphatically
 
01:47:51.070 --> 01:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
yes number two uh should the legislature
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
should we be dictating specific academic
 
01:47:58.510 --> 01:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
measures on a postsecondary level and uh
 
01:48:01.149 --> 01:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
I agree uh that we should not for the
 
01:48:03.149 --> 01:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
most part again it's someone who has
 
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
worked and taught of the University
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
system for seven years and then the
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
community Crow system for for 20 years I
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
I would bristle uh at having curriculum
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
imposed or requirement impos uh if you
 
01:48:19.629 --> 01:48:19.639 align:start position:0%
think hurting legislators is like
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
hurting C then uh some you know
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
faculties are very similar uh they don't
 
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
want generally to have requirements
 
01:48:31.750 --> 01:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
impos so I get that I I am a legislator
 
01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
I am a professor or academic but I and
 
01:48:37.790 --> 01:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
many others believe that legislators
 
01:48:39.629 --> 01:48:39.639 align:start position:0%
parents and New Hampshire citizens have
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
some basic Universal expectations as to
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
what an educated college graduate should
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
know and we think that such a graduate
 
01:48:52.229 --> 01:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
should be able to read WR speak English
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
at a certain level of proficiency and we
 
01:48:57.550 --> 01:48:57.560 align:start position:0%
also think secondarily that a graduate
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
should have some minimal level of
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of history and government in
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
order to be an Engaged citizen so
 
01:49:07.310 --> 01:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
ignoring those two areas means that we
 
01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:10.679 align:start position:0%
are not doing our jobs we meaning uh
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
legislators uh now English composition
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
is a fairly Universal requirement that's
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
covered fairly well civix is not and we
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
think it should be
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
and if we as American citizen
 
01:49:25.709 --> 01:49:25.719 align:start position:0%
legislators tolerate excuse or enable
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
ignorance in such an important area then
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
then bad on
 
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
us and this is not an extreme radical
 
01:49:36.189 --> 01:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
proposal there are numerous examples of
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
this working in other
 
01:49:41.470 --> 01:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
states uh due to our wonderful federal
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
system of
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
government uh and if you don't
 
01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
understand the federal system that I
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
refer to then you should probably
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
support the civix requirement uh for
 
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
example the Florida Board of Education
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
recently put in a college Civics
 
01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
requirement Missouri uh passed into law
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
the same statute that we're looking at
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
here which requires scoring a 70 or
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
better on the
 
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
Naturalization exam so yes many of us
 
01:50:08.589 --> 01:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
feel it's not only appropriate but
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
necessary for the legislature for this
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
committee to codify expectations here I
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
we think it's our duty our job and
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
number three uh is this an unfed
 
01:50:19.119 --> 01:50:20.550 align:start position:0%
number three uh is this an unfed
unfunded

01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
mandate uh this comes up often
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
appropriately so want to make the case
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
that much of what our legislature passes
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
involves some sort of unfunded Mandate
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
of sorts uh so sometimes we do need to
 
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
monetize things that's why we have
 
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
occasional fiscal notes uh but requiring
 
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
this modest assessment really shouldn't
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
be that taxing quote unquote air quotes
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
taxing uh as our 44th President like to
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
say and I know you all know who our 44th
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
president was uh yes we can yes we can
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
an inspiring motto much more inspiring
 
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
than no we can't no we can't so it's
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
been said before be said again that if
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
we ask for this ass assessment we have
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
send Oney the call system so they can
 
01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
hire more people to implement it and I
 
01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.109 align:start position:0%
hire more people to implement it and I
say

01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:51:13.390 --> 01:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
really I've also worked as a sports
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
information director public information
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
officer and almost every day my office
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
receive requests for information
 
01:51:21.950 --> 01:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
statistic interviews data photos You
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
Name It We regularly get requests for
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
reports or forms to fill out we just did
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
it it was our job and colleges have
 
01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
regist offices and counseling offices
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
and academic advising officers and all
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of services in place to document
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
and certify transcripts and and uh
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
assist students in their Journeys so the
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is in place interns could
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
help so the the notion that this is a a
 
01:51:53.229 --> 01:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
major crossly requirement uh we
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
reject so um and it's also important to
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
point out uh to finish this up that last
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
week uh the New Hampshire House of
 
01:52:04.069 --> 01:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
Representatives overwhelmingly passed HB
 
01:52:06.669 --> 01:52:06.679 align:start position:0%
320 a similar measure that simply
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
required that New Hampshire High School
 
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
students uh also score a 70 or better in
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
the citizenship test as a graduation
 
01:52:17.310 --> 01:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
requirement uh the measure passed our
 
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
body by almost 70 votes with SP
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
sponsorship and support from both
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
parties so we're we're optimistic that
 
01:52:26.669 --> 01:52:26.679 align:start position:0%
this measure will also be approved by
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
the upper body and signed into law by
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
the governor and if anyone at home does
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
not know what I mean by the upper body
 
01:52:37.390 --> 01:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
then well you maybe should have taken
 
01:52:40.510 --> 01:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
zimic so the point here is that if HB
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
320 becomes LW then that covers the
 
01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:44.830 align:start position:0%
320 becomes LW then that covers the
college

01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
college
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
requirement that this measure H be 319
 
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
the first so uh hopefully many of sub
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
320 makes it all the way to becoming WR
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
and then eventually that would take care
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
of this requirement for future college
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
students from New
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um to uh to
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
satisfy and uh as to the implementation
 
01:53:08.510 --> 01:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
of the exam on campuses I've taught uh
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
using the Blackboard platform nhti used
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
a different platform teaching in
 
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
University system an online version is
 
01:53:19.229 --> 01:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
very easy and simple to set up and to
 
01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
administer students could take it at
 
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
their convenience in their
 
01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
pajamas uh if they so desire um
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
traditional paper exams of course would
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
be an option that's kind of up to the uh
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
institutions so anyway to conclude uh I
 
01:53:38.189 --> 01:53:38.199 align:start position:0%
I I want to share some of the feedback
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
we received after passing HB 320 the
 
01:53:40.639 --> 01:53:41.830 align:start position:0%
we received after passing HB 320 the
iceo

01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
iceo
 
01:53:43.709 --> 01:53:43.719 align:start position:0%
requirement uh which some of you may
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
have seen comments like great idea
 
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
overdue it's about time
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
yes way to go and God bless you so we
 
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
got some good feedback from that PE
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
people parents want these Civics
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
measures they want these both those to
 
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
move forward students maybe not so much
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
right now but uh they'll they'll thank
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
us later so say say no we can I say yes
 
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
we can and I hope that we'll vote Yes we
 
01:54:14.189 --> 01:54:14.199 align:start position:0%
can and I'd be happy to take any
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
questions for represent
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
M oh yes
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking the
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
question um so you say there's no
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
additional requirement or cost but how
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
would this test be delivered well what
 
01:54:35.950 --> 01:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
is your expectation here and how this
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
would be done is it done in specific
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
courses many universities don't require
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily any particular history
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
requirement or if they
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
do it could be European history or world
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
history um so where do you expect this
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
this test to be delivered at no cost and
 
01:54:58.189 --> 01:54:58.199 align:start position:0%
at no um at no cost at all whether it be
 
01:55:01.069 --> 01:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
Financial cost or time taken up in other
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
classes in a university setting thank
 
01:55:06.430 --> 01:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
you uh show up of my thanks for the
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
question I I I thought I kind of just
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
spoke that uh to I don't want to be too
 
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
prescriptive in telling any institution
 
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
precisely how to uh satisfy a
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
requirement but as I said earlier uh
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
from my own experience to create an
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
assessment and make it available online
 
01:55:26.910 --> 01:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
and I specifically mentioned the
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
Blackboard capability and uh and I also
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned a different platform I used
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
the university system these as I said
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
these exams can be uh created online
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
students would take it with a with a
 
01:55:44.830 --> 01:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
passcode uh if they're convenience so uh
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
so for student was in college for two
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
three four years to uh at one point
 
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh make some time to take this online I
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
think would be very very simple and easy
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very followup Mr chairman
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
followup so I mean in this sort of
 
01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
system you're proposing let's say a
 
01:56:06.750 --> 01:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
Blackboard exam or an online exam that's
 
01:56:09.069 --> 01:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
available at any time I mean I can go
 
01:56:11.470 --> 01:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
online now I have gone online and I I've
 
01:56:13.350 --> 01:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
looked up the exam I have copies of the
 
01:56:15.629 --> 01:56:15.639 align:start position:0%
questions I also have all the answers so
 
01:56:17.629 --> 01:56:17.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure what you expect to
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish here in terms of actual F
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge if the student can take it
 
01:56:24.430 --> 01:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
online and simply have next to them the
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
list of questions and the list of
 
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
answers sure thank you that's a good
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
question and uh I go back to the the
 
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
many many assessments uh exercises uh
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
Etc that I've required students to do
 
01:56:42.669 --> 01:56:42.679 align:start position:0%
online and and uh it's it's always been
 
01:56:45.629 --> 01:56:45.639 align:start position:0%
a concern about online type of exams and
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
there there are ways to provide some
 
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
security uh with in administering those
 
01:56:53.550 --> 01:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh you know having the
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
material in front of them uh that's
 
01:56:58.790 --> 01:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's a reality and and the fact of the
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
matter is that if uh if the student
 
01:57:08.069 --> 01:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
takes the 128 question assessment uh
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
however they answer the questions
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
whether they study ahead of time or they
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
use notes with them uh just the fact
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
that they have to read and look at 128
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
relevant useful uh screen
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
history and civics government questions
 
01:57:25.750 --> 01:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh is only a plus so this material would
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
inevitably wash over anyone who takes
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
the exam and uh by osmosis if nothing
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
else uh they would become better
 
01:57:37.629 --> 01:57:37.639 align:start position:0%
informed more knowledgeable and and
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
smarter final question Mr chair one more
 
01:57:44.069 --> 01:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
question yes okay thank you so um um did
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
I hear correctly representative that um
 
01:57:48.910 --> 01:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire students who if if the
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
other bill is signed into law that New
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students who would take the uh
 
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
exam uh in high school uh that would
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
cover for them in college or in
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
University in the public system if I
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
heard that correctly well I guess my
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
question is one did I hear that
 
01:58:06.390 --> 01:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
correctly and second if that is so then
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
really is this exam then at the
 
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
University level aimed at transfer
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
students from out of state and
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
international students because that
 
01:58:15.550 --> 01:58:15.560 align:start position:0%
would be the only other people who would
 
01:58:18.350 --> 01:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
who would be subject to it thank you
 
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
sure thank you uh
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
good question uh certainly if uh HP 320
 
01:58:26.350 --> 01:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
moves continues to move forward and it
 
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
becomes a high school requirement then
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh it would be redundant for them to
 
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
take the exact same exam so it' be like
 
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
an AP uh type situation where or running
 
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
stock type situation where a student
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
satisfies this requirement in high
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
school uh just very easily is uh added
 
01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
to their colge transcript so this uh of
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
course initially should 39 HB 319 move
 
01:58:53.589 --> 01:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
forward then you know current colge
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
students would need to uh to take the
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
exam uh and yes good good question uh
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
out of Staters uh particularly
 
01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
University system the community college
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
system is 90 95% of Hampshire uh
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
students uh University system has a much
 
01:59:16.109 --> 01:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
higher percentage of out of Staters and
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh they would have to take this if this
 
01:59:20.910 --> 01:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
moves forward they have to take this to
 
01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
satisfy uh University system
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
requirements which we think is good you
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
know they would uh know more document
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
that they've learned some history C some
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
government before they graduate from
 
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
University thank you thank you uh
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
representa wock thank you representative
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
repres M thank you for taking my
 
01:59:45.629 --> 01:59:45.639 align:start position:0%
question I may have missed this I was I
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
was just a question about the finances I
 
01:59:50.069 --> 01:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
know you said there wasn't much to it um
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
if a college requires this can they
 
01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
course thank you it's it's not a course
 
02:00:04.069 --> 02:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
it's a just a an assessment it's uh for
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
example when I started college I had to
 
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
take a uh math proficiency and an
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
English comp proficiency uh test and if
 
02:00:15.310 --> 02:00:15.320 align:start position:0%
I didn't do well enough on those exams I
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
would have to take college math or
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
college uh English
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh I not you need know this I did pass
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
those exams this a similar type thing
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
colleges oftentimes have uh requirements
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
or assessments of different sorts
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
surveys or whatever uh to help them uh
 
02:00:38.069 --> 02:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
for example at NTI we had every student
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh take a math test so that we could
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
determine which Math course would they
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
be best suited for so uh yeah this type
 
02:00:48.069 --> 02:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
of assessment is uh is is really fairly
 
02:00:51.109 --> 02:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
routine and uh postsecondary
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
institutions followup Mr chair yes thank
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
you representa m i I understand the
 
02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
college piece I was there for 12 years
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
but I also understand that every time
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
the college has an opportunity to charge
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
a student for a activity they typically
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
do because they're in the business of
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
making money or staying afloat so a
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
mathematical assessment exam where they
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
going to be placed do they need to take
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
an addition College course which they
 
02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
have to pay for all I'm saying is is
 
02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
there going to be any requirement or
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
anything you Bill that would prohibit a
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
college or from charging any fee to the
 
02:01:32.030 --> 02:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
student I just see this as a as a money
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
maker for colleges so is there anything
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
thing to prohibit that thank you obser
 
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting never thought of
 
02:01:44.069 --> 02:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
that uh that Financial component is in
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
charging uh the wheels are turning a
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
little bit I suppose if an inst
 
02:01:52.109 --> 02:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
institution wanted to uh make it
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
available in some fashion to uh even non
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
students to come in and take it and pay
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
money to uh to take this exam uh that's
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
something maybe they locally could
 
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
decide hadn't thought about that but
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's an interesting thought but
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
b line is uh I I certainly would not
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
anticipate any charge for the students
 
02:02:18.069 --> 02:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
to have to take the required assessment
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
it would be free BAS
 
02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative representa M thank you Mr
 
02:02:26.910 --> 02:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so just clear up
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
for me if you will representative
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
Moffett would you use this exam as an
 
02:02:40.629 --> 02:02:40.639 align:start position:0%
admission requirement
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
in thank you well no no uh don't
 
02:02:46.189 --> 02:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
Envision this as an admission
 
02:02:49.589 --> 02:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
requirement at all uh it would just be
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh a graduation requirement that could
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
be checked off at some point uh probably
 
02:02:58.589 --> 02:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
at the students convenience if if it if
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
the institution opts to make it
 
02:03:00.639 --> 02:03:03.310 align:start position:0%
the institution opts to make it
available

02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:03:06.109 --> 02:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
online a followup Please Mr chair thank
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
you um so how thank you representative
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
for for clearing that up how would uh
 
02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
what kind of Provisions would you make
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
for international students would they be
 
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
required to pass this exam in the same
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
way that you would expect that if I went
 
02:03:26.109 --> 02:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
to the University of Rome that I would
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
be able to pass an exam on Italian
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
government thank
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
you very interesting question and and uh
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
again it's it's graduation requirement
 
02:03:41.549 --> 02:03:41.559 align:start position:0%
uh for example as I mentioned English
 
02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
composition is a fairly Universal
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
postsecondary requirement so in most
 
02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:49.669 align:start position:0%
postsecondary requirement so in most
every

02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
every
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
nowadays most every person in your
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
institution has an
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
ESL office or ESL
 
02:03:59.589 --> 02:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
coordinator so yes if we expect our
 
02:04:01.950 --> 02:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
graduates to speak and right at a
 
02:04:04.350 --> 02:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
certain level of English uh wherever
 
02:04:06.549 --> 02:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
they come from uh this would just kind
 
02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
of go hand in hand with that I mean if
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
they can't speak or read English then
 
02:04:13.870 --> 02:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
they yes they'd have trouble with this
 
02:04:18.950 --> 02:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
exam but I I think that we expect our
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
way the universal requirement of English
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
composition is it is an expectation that
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
students uh wherever they come from have
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
a a certain level of English
 
02:04:32.270 --> 02:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
proficiency thank you very much uh not
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
see any more hands for represent we do
 
02:04:39.629 --> 02:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
have yes thank you thanks than my
 
02:04:42.430 --> 02:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
question um we just went through um
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
passing the bill in a house for high
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
school at 70 score level uh College
 
02:04:52.549 --> 02:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we bump that up to 80 perhaps
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's the higher standard for
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
college uh thank you s if the folks in
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
home me near his question he thought
 
02:05:02.189 --> 02:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
that perhaps 70 is too forgiving and we
 
02:05:03.549 --> 02:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
should have a higher standard for
 
02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
college students uh I understand your
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
thinking I kind of support that but uh
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
to keep things consistent and simple uh
 
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
if we ask high school students to get a
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
70 and if they're going to uh
 
02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
theoretically use the same exam to
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
satisfy a college
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
requirement uh if we did that then they
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
might get a 70 in high school and then
 
02:05:25.709 --> 02:05:25.719 align:start position:0%
they have to take it again to get an 80
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
in college so to keep it simple and
 
02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
sweet we're just keeping it at 70 at uh
 
02:05:33.549 --> 02:05:33.559 align:start position:0%
a proposal for both both
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
levels thank you very much uh no more
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
questions we have represent or not
 
02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:42.760 align:start position:0%

than you representative uh good morning
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the opportunity to
 
02:05:55.350 --> 02:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
speak with you this morning for the
 
02:05:57.069 --> 02:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
record my name is Tom Cronin I'm the
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for the
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
University system of New Hampshire uh i'
 
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
just like to start with a thanks to
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Moffett uh for his
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
Outreach on this bill uh he's been in
 
02:06:08.229 --> 02:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
touch a little bit over the last couple
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
of days just to sort of tell us a little
 
02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
bit more about his motivation and and
 
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
how he's trying to to see this through
 
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
so we certainly appreciate uh that
 
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
Outreach um we also share sort of his
 
02:06:19.629 --> 02:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
concern for these issues and some of the
 
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
sponsors concerns uh we we definitely
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
believe it is part of our responsibility
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
to help prepare our students to be
 
02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
engaged and informed Civic participants
 
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
um so for those reasons we're we're
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill but we did want to
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
speak today to a number of concerns with
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
the drafting that we hope the committee
 
02:06:39.390 --> 02:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
could consider going forward um so if I
 
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
can Mr chairman I'll just I'll just run
 
02:06:43.870 --> 02:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
through those quickly so to begin and a
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
number of these have been sort of uh
 
02:06:46.990 --> 02:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
discussed by the committee in questions
 
02:06:48.910 --> 02:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
so far but to begin the bill puts the
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
onus on students to show proof of having
 
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
passed uh the citizenship and
 
02:06:55.229 --> 02:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
Immigration Services test with a score
 
02:06:57.549 --> 02:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
of 70 or better so certainly uh our
 
02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
institutions appreciate that the bill
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
does not seem to create a new
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
administrative burden for the
 
02:07:04.589 --> 02:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
institutions to oversee the test but the
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
bill is pretty vague and these questions
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
sort of raise those questions as to what
 
02:07:10.669 --> 02:07:10.679 align:start position:0%
is required of the institution so for us
 
02:07:12.030 --> 02:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
I think a question would be what
 
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
constitutes proof of having passed the
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
test who is that proof supposed to be
 
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
reported to uh what kind of record
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
keeping would be required um so there's
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
conversation so far about including
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
these on transcripts nothing in the bill
 
02:07:27.069 --> 02:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
seems to put a requirement on
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
institutions to do any of this work um
 
02:07:32.669 --> 02:07:32.679 align:start position:0%
second the Bill's requirements for
 
02:07:33.790 --> 02:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
passing the test are a little bit
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
unclear um so I had to do a little bit
 
02:07:37.709 --> 02:07:37.719 align:start position:0%
of research on the the test myself and
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
preparing for the hearing so our
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is the 2020 immigration
 
02:07:44.430 --> 02:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
test asks citizenship applicants
 
02:07:47.629 --> 02:07:47.639 align:start position:0%
randomly 20 out of the 128 possible
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
questions applicants need to answer 12
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
of those correctly which is a 60% so is
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
the expectation that students would need
 
02:07:57.629 --> 02:07:57.639 align:start position:0%
to answer 14 out of 20 random questions
 
02:07:59.950 --> 02:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh or are they expected to answer 90 out
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the full 128 question test if I did
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
my math right on that um so it's it's
 
02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
not clear to us what test what test
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
students are supposed to take or how
 
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be uh administered um
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
as I think folks know this test is
 
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
designed to be given orally and under
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
different requirements dur in the
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
naturalization process um some quick
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
Googling I was able to find a place to
 
02:08:25.709 --> 02:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
take practice 20 question exams but I
 
02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't I could not easily locate uh how
 
02:08:31.549 --> 02:08:31.559 align:start position:0%
to take the full 128 question exam as I
 
02:08:33.549 --> 02:08:33.559 align:start position:0%
think representative lay noted there is
 
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
however very easily accessible uh the
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
full 128 questions with the answers
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
right next to them um a date requirement
 
02:08:42.709 --> 02:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
the bill sets this new requirement for
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
students admitted or transferring to the
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
institutions on or after January 1:22 so
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
so that's just an that's a bit of an
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
awkward date for academic years as
 
02:08:53.709 --> 02:08:53.719 align:start position:0%
you're all well aware so for some number
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
of years this language is going to
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
result in some students in different
 
02:08:58.470 --> 02:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
graduating years needing to take the
 
02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
test While others won't just because of
 
02:09:02.549 --> 02:09:02.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not they transferred into or
 
02:09:05.069 --> 02:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
uh if when they started at the
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
University uh similarly uh as you're all
 
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
aware the house recently passed House
 
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 320 um so thank you we it was
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
helpful to hear a little bit that it
 
02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
would effectively create I guess an opt
 
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
out for New Hampshire students that have
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
passed that test um there is a little
 
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
bit I think of confusion about again how
 
02:09:23.990 --> 02:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
we record keep that do we just do
 
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
students just need to to tell us that
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
they passed the test in high school um
 
02:09:31.470 --> 02:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
and that's sufficient proof similarly uh
 
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
the sponsor noted a couple other states
 
02:09:36.390 --> 02:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
that have similar tests so our students
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
from and I forget the examples he gave
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
but our students from those States able
 
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
to to Simply opt out and again this is
 
02:09:44.830 --> 02:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
obviously a small population but for
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
naturalized citizens who have actually
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
taken the test are they able to opt out
 
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
um and finally this is a little
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
bit again more of a technical question
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
but the bill is very specific and
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
requiring students to pass the 2020
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
version of the test uh as you may know
 
02:10:04.270 --> 02:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
this 202 2020 test uh was an update by
 
02:10:05.790 --> 02:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
the Trump Administration that was
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
finalized in November of 2020 um I
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
believe it was just last week or the
 
02:10:11.709 --> 02:10:11.719 align:start position:0%
week before the Biden Administration
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
announced their intention to do away
 
02:10:17.069 --> 02:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
with that update and uh effective April
 
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
19th of 21
 
02:10:20.549 --> 02:10:20.559 align:start position:0%
citizenship and immigration services
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
will only be offering the 2008 test so
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
again given the specificity of the
 
02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
proposal it's unclear how students are
 
02:10:28.830 --> 02:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
going to meet the 2020 requirement if
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
that test is no longer accessible
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
through citizenship and immigration and
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
similarly if there are future updates to
 
02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
the test uh the legislation as written
 
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
would seem to sort of Hold Us in a
 
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
moment in time um that may or may not be
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
again accessible or doable uh should
 
02:10:47.310 --> 02:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
there be changes and then lastly I just
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know just want to point out you know
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
on a a fundamental level um when the
 
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
legislature established the university
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
system in 1981 um the general court
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
wrote the general court has delegated
 
02:11:00.270 --> 02:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
broad authority to the Board of Trustees
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
who shall be responsible for managing
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
the university system in a manner which
 
02:11:05.790 --> 02:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
promotes academic excellence and serves
 
02:11:07.390 --> 02:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
the educational needs of the people of
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so as you can imagine our
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
board our administrative leadership our
 
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
faculty take this responsibility
 
02:11:14.870 --> 02:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
seriously um and I would just note that
 
02:11:18.589 --> 02:11:18.599 align:start position:0%
nowhere else to my knowledge in RSA 187
 
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
has the legislature seen fit to
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
establish specific graduation
 
02:11:23.790 --> 02:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
requirements so this would be kind of a
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
Step Beyond what is what the legislature
 
02:11:28.510 --> 02:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
has typically done uh in regard to kind
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
of their oversight of the University
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
system um so I think with that I'll stop
 
02:11:34.589 --> 02:11:34.599 align:start position:0%
and I would of course be happy to to
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Cronin uh repr hops you have a
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you for taking my
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
question and thank you Mr Cronin I was
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had sent this testimony
 
02:11:47.790 --> 02:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
into our emails I had not yet I will as
 
02:11:49.709 --> 02:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
soon as we wrap up or as soon as I wrap
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
up that would be helpful thank
 
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
you questions from representative
 
02:11:57.629 --> 02:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
whitcock thank you chairman Le thank you
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
Mr cor for taking my question going back
 
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
to the uh possible fee attachment if the
 
02:12:04.229 --> 02:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
university system was required to
 
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
administer this test track this test put
 
02:12:08.510 --> 02:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
on the transcripts and show somehow that
 
02:12:10.910 --> 02:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
it was passed or not passed or retaken
 
02:12:12.549 --> 02:12:12.559 align:start position:0%
would there would you believe typically
 
02:12:13.709 --> 02:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
there'd be an administrative fee for
 
02:12:15.709 --> 02:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
that or a course credit fee for that
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I would I don't think so I
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's it would it would really all depend
 
02:12:25.069 --> 02:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
on again there there were too many
 
02:12:26.430 --> 02:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
questions for us to really there was no
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal note attached to this so we
 
02:12:29.549 --> 02:12:29.559 align:start position:0%
haven't kind of dived into that piece of
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
it and again the questions I raised are
 
02:12:32.589 --> 02:12:32.599 align:start position:0%
questions we'd have on how we would
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
administer this um I I think I'd want to
 
02:12:37.629 --> 02:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
say no to that answer but I don't know
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
until we kind of a better understanding
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
of what would be expected uh from the
 
02:12:43.629 --> 02:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
administrative administrative side thank
 
02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr croner thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
you there further questions we do have
 
02:12:51.069 --> 02:12:51.079 align:start position:0%
the Community colle system also waiting
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
y so we'll go ahead thank you very much
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.119 --> 02:13:01.709 align:start position:0%
 
all

02:13:01.709 --> 02:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
sh H yep we have Shannon Reed and I
 
02:13:07.390 --> 02:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if uh representative Moffett
 
02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
had a
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
question sure M I didn't know if you
 
02:13:14.229 --> 02:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
wanted me to respond to some M quickly
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
respond to some of Mr cronin's questions
 
02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
or not but no because you presenting and
 
02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
you can't respond as a Committee Member
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
I didn't know if you had a question okay
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
goad go ahead Shannon Reed okay thank
 
02:13:29.470 --> 02:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
you can everybody hear me yes we can
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay great thanks um my name is Shannon
 
02:13:33.189 --> 02:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
Reed I am director of government Affairs
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
for the community college system of New
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'd like to thank you all for
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify and just a
 
02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
warning my my home is being buffeted I
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
feel like I might end up in Oz at some
 
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
point with the wind and my power has
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
been flickering so if I disappear it's
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's because of that and not anything
 
02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:48.709 align:start position:0%
it's because of that and not anything
else

02:13:48.709 --> 02:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:13:50.990 --> 02:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so the sign-in sheet for remote
 
02:13:53.109 --> 02:13:53.119 align:start position:0%
testimony only offers the options of
 
02:13:55.229 --> 02:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
support oppose or neutral and really
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
none of these exactly fits my testimony
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
I come with questions and a few concerns
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh to share with the committee first I
 
02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
would I would like to say that ccsnh
 
02:14:05.950 --> 02:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
believes strongly that knowledge of
 
02:14:08.030 --> 02:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
civics is important to the richness and
 
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
success of our democracy we cultivate
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
that with opportunities for students to
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
take courses see candidates hear
 
02:14:16.189 --> 02:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
speakers and participate in a variety of
 
02:14:18.549 --> 02:14:18.559 align:start position:0%
events and activities
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
academically while specific offerings
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
vary across our seven colleges we have a
 
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
general outcome expectation for students
 
02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
to acquire Knowledge and Skills to
 
02:14:29.629 --> 02:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
function effectively as informed
 
02:14:32.109 --> 02:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
citizens students can meet this outcome
 
02:14:34.030 --> 02:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
by completing general education courses
 
02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
or major courses U and specifics are
 
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
going to differ by college and program
 
02:14:40.189 --> 02:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
but it's likely that students in an
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
associate degree program will take one
 
02:14:44.870 --> 02:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
or more courses such as American
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
government US History state and local
 
02:14:49.709 --> 02:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
government inter to political science
 
02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
American constitutional history that
 
02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
that type of thing um certain majors
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
will focus on this curriculum while for
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
others they would come in as
 
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
electives so in approaching this bill we
 
02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
have a few questions to raise that we
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
hope the committee will explore or the
 
02:15:06.990 --> 02:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh perhaps clarify and um my
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
comments today are really designed to
 
02:15:11.629 --> 02:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
help us us and the committee arrive at a
 
02:15:13.149 --> 02:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
full understanding of not just the
 
02:15:14.950 --> 02:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill but also its
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
implications and we do appreciate the
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors having connected with us prior
 
02:15:21.030 --> 02:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
to the hearing um to talk about several
 
02:15:23.229 --> 02:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
of these concerns I will try not to be
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
redundant because some of these
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
questions have already been raised and
 
02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
discussed um but but first we have also
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
assumed that nothing in this Bill calls
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
upon the colleges to administer this
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
test but but only obligates students to
 
02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrate having passed it as
 
02:15:40.549 --> 02:15:40.559 align:start position:0%
specified we had the same questions
 
02:15:42.270 --> 02:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
about how individuals will access the
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
test and validate having passed and the
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor addressed that um but I think
 
02:15:47.790 --> 02:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
there are probably still some question
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
questions connected with those Logistics
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
second and this this is more a question
 
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
for I think the community colleges than
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
the university system but to what types
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
of programs would this requirement apply
 
02:16:02.750 --> 02:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
for for example we offer associate
 
02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:04.599 align:start position:0%
degree programs which are typically
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
completed in two years of full-time
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
study or longer if a student is going
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
part-time and two-thirds of our students
 
02:16:13.149 --> 02:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
do go part-time um but we also offer
 
02:16:15.589 --> 02:16:15.599 align:start position:0%
short-term programs certificates boot
 
02:16:18.549 --> 02:16:18.559 align:start position:0%
camps uh industry certification programs
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
um the bill doesn't specify but our one
 
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
question is um to to what type of
 
02:16:25.430 --> 02:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
programs um with this requirement for
 
02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
having pass this test apply um third the
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor reference Tas Bill 320 which
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
creates that high school requirement um
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
and suggested that that might ease the
 
02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
burden on on college students then
 
02:16:40.589 --> 02:16:40.599 align:start position:0%
making that transition from high school
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
to College New Hampshire nearly half of
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
our students are overage 25 with a
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
significant proportion being in their
 
02:16:49.309 --> 02:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
30s or or more so we would just note
 
02:16:50.589 --> 02:16:50.599 align:start position:0%
that the high school requirement
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't position those students in the
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
same way as it would a student who just
 
02:16:56.030 --> 02:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
graduated from a New Hampshire High
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
School my fourth question relates to
 
02:17:01.230 --> 02:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
licensing and this may require
 
02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
information from the office of
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
professional lenser uh and that and that
 
02:17:07.309 --> 02:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
is would there be an impact for students
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
who have otherwise completed a program
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
and would sit for a licensing exam to
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
enter a profession if they haven't met
 
02:17:15.549 --> 02:17:15.559 align:start position:0%
this requirement and therefore haven't
 
02:17:17.709 --> 02:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
technically graduated I don't know if
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
this would be an issue frankly but it
 
02:17:20.349 --> 02:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
came up in our in our internal
 
02:17:22.070 --> 02:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
conversations about the bill and it
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
seemed worth looking into um that would
 
02:17:26.429 --> 02:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
certainly be a concern for us since one
 
02:17:28.589 --> 02:17:28.599 align:start position:0%
of our priorities is graduating students
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
who can enter professions in their
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
communities we also had questions about
 
02:17:35.270 --> 02:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
whether this bill could create
 
02:17:38.509 --> 02:17:38.519 align:start position:0%
accreditation issues for our colleges in
 
02:17:40.790 --> 02:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
that it it may be seen as creating some
 
02:17:43.309 --> 02:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
kind of a curricular requirement we went
 
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
right to the source for that and shared
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
the language with the New England
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
Commission on higher education
 
02:17:50.750 --> 02:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Nei which I believe is here today to
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
testify to those specific points that
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
they know far more about that than I do
 
02:17:56.750 --> 02:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll just wrap up with two
 
02:17:56.760 --> 02:17:57.990 align:start position:0%
and I'll just wrap up with two
additional

02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:18:00.190 --> 02:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
considerations um first as I mentioned
 
02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
earlier two-thirds of our students are
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
part-time completing a program is
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
typically one of many responsibilities
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
that a community college student is
 
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
juggling which may include full-time or
 
02:18:13.349 --> 02:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
part-time work parenting Etc as I said
 
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
we certainly believe that knowledge of
 
02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
civics is important to the richness and
 
02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
success of our democracy the fact is
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
though that adding this requirement
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
could be a barrier to college completion
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
we do a lot at our colleges to to try
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
lower barriers I understand the
 
02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor's emphasis on Civics education
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
and certainly share the concern but this
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
is an important consideration for us and
 
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
finally um the requirements of hospit
 
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
319 are for students at New Hampshire's
 
02:18:44.309 --> 02:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
public colleges and universities only if
 
02:18:46.469 --> 02:18:46.479 align:start position:0%
finding and taking this test is at all
 
02:18:48.669 --> 02:18:48.679 align:start position:0%
an onerous requirement and it may not be
 
02:18:50.589 --> 02:18:50.599 align:start position:0%
but if it is this bill May create a
 
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
disincentive for students to enroll at
 
02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
our colleges in favor of Institutions
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
that don't have this requirement such as
 
02:18:58.589 --> 02:18:58.599 align:start position:0%
private colleges or other types of
 
02:19:01.309 --> 02:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
training programs or colleges across our
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
borders um again if if accessing this
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
test is a fairly simple matter then this
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
would be less of a concern for us so to
 
02:19:10.429 --> 02:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
to wrap up um we certainly understand
 
02:19:11.950 --> 02:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
the desire for our citizenry to
 
02:19:13.389 --> 02:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
demonstrate knowledge about the Civic
 
02:19:15.150 --> 02:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
life and Foundation of our state and our
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
nation and and we commend the sponsor
 
02:19:19.870 --> 02:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
really for his his his attention to this
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
his examples and his his testimony and
 
02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
and his intent um our concerns really
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
are um more of a practical nature so I
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer any questions if
 
02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
I can and I I do know the $10 bill one
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
mfet sorry I just asked question
 
02:19:38.479 --> 02:19:42.230 align:start position:0%
mfet sorry I just asked question
question

02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:45.830 --> 02:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
joing let's go ahead here with u
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions are any questions for the
 
02:19:52.510 --> 02:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
system thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
Miss re for taking a question what per I
 
02:20:00.270 --> 02:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
know the community colleges offers
 
02:20:04.590 --> 02:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
courses in the trades and whatnot and I
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
also remember National Community colge
 
02:20:10.030 --> 02:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
some years ago we had one Governor Judge
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
Greg Supreme Court Justice judge sud
 
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
discussing Civics and the requirements
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
my question is what what percentage of
 
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
community college students actually
 
02:20:30.670 --> 02:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
tra I think your question was what
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of our students graduate with
 
02:20:37.950 --> 02:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
a degree in the trades yeah um I don't
 
02:20:40.030 --> 02:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
know the precise percentage and and you
 
02:20:41.469 --> 02:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
know the trades isn't what it used to be
 
02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know our students will
 
02:20:45.309 --> 02:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
graduate for instance with an Associate
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
Degree in welding technology or an
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
automotive technology I mean those are
 
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
those are full-fledged degrees there
 
02:20:53.670 --> 02:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
also shorter term certificate options
 
02:20:55.389 --> 02:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
for those too so I think there's a
 
02:20:57.790 --> 02:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
little more blending than your question
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
um necessarily um suggests in terms of
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
of of an answer
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
but if I'm guessing I would
 
02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:07.790 align:start position:0%
but if I'm guessing I would
say

02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:21:10.349 --> 02:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
40% maybe or you know what I'm gonna
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
have to I'm gonna have to get back to
 
02:21:12.990 --> 02:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
with a more precise number because I
 
02:21:15.389 --> 02:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
don't want to I don't want to answer
 
02:21:19.309 --> 02:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Shannon are there
 
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
further questions for the community of
 
02:21:26.830 --> 02:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
college thank you very much thank
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
you we have P o'ri from the New England
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
Commission of higher education go ahead
 
02:21:37.710 --> 02:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
please thank you very much uh thank you
 
02:21:39.750 --> 02:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and members of the committee
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Pat O'Brien and I am here
 
02:21:43.550 --> 02:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New England Commission
 
02:21:46.270 --> 02:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
of higher education Nei to speak about
 
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 39 19 as you may know Nei is
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
the higher education accrediting agency
 
02:21:53.710 --> 02:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
that accredits colleges and universities
 
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
in the six New England States including
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
the public colleges and universities of
 
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire institutions receive many
 
02:22:02.349 --> 02:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
benefits from being accredited by Nei
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
not the least of which is that their
 
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
students qualify to receive federal
 
02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
financial aid such as pel grants and
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
Stafford Loans and the institutions
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
themselves qualify for federal grants
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
through for example NIH or
 
02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
NSF I was asked by the community college
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire to discuss
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
whether implementation of the
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
requirement noted in House Bill 319
 
02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
would raise any concerns about
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
institution's ability to meet
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
accreditation requirements ne's
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
requirements for accreditation are
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
outlined in its standards for
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
accreditation which are available on the
 
02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
commission's website nti.org
 
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
institutions demonstrate their
 
02:22:40.590 --> 02:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
compliance with the standards through
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
submission of reports a comprehensive
 
02:22:45.309 --> 02:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
self-study every 10 years an interim
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
report at the fifth year point of the 10
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
year cycle and progress reports as
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
requested by the commission the reports
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
are reviewed by the members of the
 
02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
commission who make the decision about
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
whether an institution is in compliance
 
02:23:00.349 --> 02:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
with the standard there are some places
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
in the standards for implementation of
 
02:23:05.070 --> 02:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
the requirement of House Bill 319 may
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
affect institutional compliance with the
 
02:23:10.070 --> 02:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
standards the standard on organization
 
02:23:11.950 --> 02:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
and governance expects that the
 
02:23:14.349 --> 02:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
institution will have quote sufficient
 
02:23:17.309 --> 02:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
autonomy and control of its programs
 
02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
operations end quote imposition of a
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement by the
 
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislature may suggest that the
 
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
institution's autonomy and control is
 
02:23:29.269 --> 02:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
insufficient the standard also expects
 
02:23:31.510 --> 02:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
that the institution will place quote
 
02:23:34.309 --> 02:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
primary responsibility for the content
 
02:23:36.269 --> 02:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
quality and effectiveness of the
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum with its faculty close quote
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
imp position of a graduation requirement
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
again may suggest that faculty do not
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
have the primary responsibility
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
stipulated by this stand
 
02:23:50.190 --> 02:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
standard three expectations contained in
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
the standard on the academic program are
 
02:23:55.590 --> 02:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
relevant here first the institution is
 
02:23:58.110 --> 02:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
expected to demonstrate quote its clear
 
02:24:00.750 --> 02:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
and ongoing Authority and administrative
 
02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
oversight for the academic elements of
 
02:24:04.990 --> 02:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
all courses for which it Awards
 
02:24:07.790 --> 02:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
institutional credit or credentials
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
second the institutions quote evaluation
 
02:24:12.750 --> 02:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
of student learning or achievement and
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
the award of credit end quote is
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
expected to be quote based on clearly
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
stated criteria that reflect learning
 
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
objectives and are consistently and
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
effectively applied and finally from the
 
02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
standard on academic program the
 
02:24:28.230 --> 02:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
institution's award of credit is
 
02:24:30.269 --> 02:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
expected to be quote consistent with
 
02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
commission policy and the course content
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the field of study and
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
reflect the level and amount of student
 
02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
learning and be based on policies
 
02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
developed and overseen by the faculty
 
02:24:45.269 --> 02:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
and academic Administration end quote
 
02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
again uh the imposition of a graduation
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
requirement by the legislature may
 
02:24:52.389 --> 02:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
suggest that the institution does not
 
02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
possess the requisite Authority and
 
02:24:56.710 --> 02:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
oversight and or that its graduation
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
requirements are not determined by its
 
02:25:01.269 --> 02:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
faculty and academic
 
02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
Administration finally the standard on
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
students expects that the institution
 
02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
will assess its quote efforts to achieve
 
02:25:11.469 --> 02:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
an equitable educational experience for
 
02:25:13.870 --> 02:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
all of its students close quote and as
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
I've listened to uh the discussion today
 
02:25:18.190 --> 02:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
the testimony today I realize that there
 
02:25:20.070 --> 02:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
are different considerations about how
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
the test may be administered or what it
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
might cost to take that test but the US
 
02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship and immigration services
 
02:25:28.830 --> 02:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
website notes that the current filing
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
fee to take the test is
 
02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
$725 assuming that students need to pay
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
that fee in order to meet a graduation
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
requirement questions could be raised
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
about the institution's effort to
 
02:25:43.309 --> 02:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
provide that Equitable educational
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
experience required by the standard
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
given that students will have varying
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
ability to pay that fee I'll be happy to
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
provide a written copy of my remarks or
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
Andor to answer any questions that you
 
02:25:57.269 --> 02:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
may have and I thank you for your
 
02:25:59.790 --> 02:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
attention thank you very much are there
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
any questions of
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
nii I have one question for you um an
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
institution like UNH offers a bachelor's
 
02:26:11.870 --> 02:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
degree perhaps the in agriculture may be
 
02:26:15.429 --> 02:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
a two-year um they also offer Masters
 
02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
and doctoral programs
 
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
I in looking at this bill would this uh
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
requirement uh could it be applied to a
 
02:26:29.469 --> 02:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
UNH is that a
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
question me this this requirement that
 
02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
you have to take this uh citizenship
 
02:26:42.190 --> 02:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
test in order to graduate um is a
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
doctoral degree the same as a ba or BS
 
02:26:47.389 --> 02:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
as far as grad
 
02:26:50.190 --> 02:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
graduating yes the the expectation is
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
that the institution has the autonomy to
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
set the graduation requirements for all
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
the degrees that it
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
Awards whether it be a Balor or a
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
Masters or a doctoral degree thank you
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
very much are there any further
 
02:27:07.469 --> 02:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
the I I would like a copy of your your
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
points in your statement would you email
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
that to us uh yes what I'll do is I'll
 
02:27:16.389 --> 02:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
email it to Shannon Reed I think she
 
02:27:18.030 --> 02:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
knows better how to reach you than I do

legislative committee to study indoor
 
02:29:15.950 --> 02:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
air quality in schools it is nearly
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
identical to to a house bill from last
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
year House Bill
 
02:29:25.070 --> 02:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
111 1118 from last year last year's bill
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
passed the committee with an 18 to to
 
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
two vote and passed the house in a Voice
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
vote it then went on to die a covid
 
02:29:33.670 --> 02:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
death in the
 
02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
Senate this bill was a good idea last
 
02:29:38.190 --> 02:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
year and is a crucial concept now that
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
the Pand pandemic has arrived in the
 
02:29:43.269 --> 02:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
best of times indoor air quality is a
 
02:29:45.269 --> 02:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
persistent problem in many school bu
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
buildings a according to the EPA air
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
pollutants not can be two to five times
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
and occasionally up to a 100 times
 
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
greater than um outdoor levels the EPA
 
02:29:57.790 --> 02:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
and its science Advisory Board
 
02:30:00.269 --> 02:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
consistently rank indoor air pollution
 
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
among the top five environmental um
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
health risks to the public this is
 
02:30:07.550 --> 02:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
especially important to schools as
 
02:30:10.349 --> 02:30:10.359 align:start position:0%
children may be more susceptible to air
 
02:30:12.309 --> 02:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
pollutants now that we are grappling
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
with the covid pandemic the issue of add
 
02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
addressing viral contamination is a
 
02:30:19.150 --> 02:30:19.160 align:start position:0%
pressing concern along with the isue
 
02:30:21.389 --> 02:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
issue of indoor air
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
pollution RSA 200 um col
 
02:30:27.750 --> 02:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
11-a requires that the school principal
 
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
or design conduct an annual air quality
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
investigation by filling out a checklist
 
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
this procedure clearly is not sufficient
 
02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
as complaints of poor air quality
 
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
persist the EPA teamed with the Harvard
 
02:30:44.590 --> 02:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
School of Public Health to study the
 
02:30:47.070 --> 02:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
issue of air quality in schools
 
02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that the study committee
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
of from this bill utilize the experts
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
associated with the Harvard study to
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
assist in studying New Hampshire
 
02:30:59.150 --> 02:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
schools one advantage we have this year
 
02:31:01.230 --> 02:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
is addressing this concept in the first
 
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
year of the
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
vium this will give the study committee
 
02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:06.800 align:start position:0%
two years to conduct its work the
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee the committee report is due
 
02:31:11.070 --> 02:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
November 1
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
20122 this is a this is a crucial issue
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
that should be thoroughly
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
investigated the committee will also be
 
02:31:19.710 --> 02:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
hearing from Jen given a teacher from
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hollis Brookline School District to
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
provide firsthand information regarding
 
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
air quality in schools Brian Hawkins
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
will provide broader testimony across a
 
02:31:30.429 --> 02:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
wider range of districts I'd be happy to
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
take any questions from the
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much
 
02:31:35.389 --> 02:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions for
 
02:31:35.399 --> 02:31:36.990 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions for
the

02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative um I did you have a
 
02:31:43.309 --> 02:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
question Hopson uh thank you for taking
 
02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
my qu my question um representative lad
 
02:31:49.469 --> 02:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
and representative Sullivan um I was
 
02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
doing some research and found that there
 
02:31:54.030 --> 02:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
were two other bills hb1
 
02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
1265 and hb1
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
1289 uh both of those bills one was in
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
2000 I think they were both in
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
2010 and they they put um investigation
 
02:32:10.190 --> 02:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
of air quality Tools for
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
Schools um and then the school board in
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
each School District to um
 
02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
Implement policies to address air
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
quality um are
 
02:32:26.190 --> 02:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
these uh are these measures not enough
 
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying uh by putting
 
02:32:29.910 --> 02:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:32:32.269 --> 02:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
forward the information that has been
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
coming from well thank you for the
 
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
question um the information we've been
 
02:32:38.590 --> 02:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
getting from the schools um from from uh
 
02:32:41.349 --> 02:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
staff members from schools um has been
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
that uh the problem persists um and so
 
02:32:47.469 --> 02:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
the efforts that were made 10 years ago
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
um clearly we're not sufficient to um
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
address the uh the problems so yes I
 
02:32:56.830 --> 02:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
guess I would agree that um um the
 
02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
efforts 10 years ago were not
 
02:33:02.110 --> 02:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient further questions
 
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
repres thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:33:06.950 --> 02:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative um I was just wondering
 
02:33:11.910 --> 02:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
if you were uh aware of the federal uh S
 
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
one and two funds um that are available
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
to school TOS that
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh Encompass air quality is one of the
 
02:33:27.630 --> 02:33:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh items that can be a source of
 
02:33:29.469 --> 02:33:29.479 align:start position:0%
expenditures I believe there's something
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
like $36 million in extra one and over
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
$150 million in exra two um so it seems
 
02:33:40.830 --> 02:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
to me that there are are federal funds
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
available to meet air quality um issues
 
02:33:47.950 --> 02:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
in local school rules uh and I was just
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
wondering if if you thought that a
 
02:33:54.349 --> 02:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
commission was required in addition to
 
02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
um these federal funds that are already
 
02:34:01.150 --> 02:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
available thank you for the question um
 
02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
the um I I guess the this is not a
 
02:34:07.309 --> 02:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
commission this is a study committee um
 
02:34:10.429 --> 02:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
but I believe the study committee um
 
02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:13.640 align:start position:0%
could very well provide information to
 
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
um uh the department as well as
 
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
individual school districts so that they
 
02:34:20.030 --> 02:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
could utilize those funds in an
 
02:34:22.750 --> 02:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
effective manner um it's one thing to
 
02:34:24.750 --> 02:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
have funds it's another thing to know
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.469 --> 02:34:31.479 align:start position:0%
them thank you very
 
02:34:34.309 --> 02:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much Mr chair and
 
02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
and uh actually this is a this is a
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
question for you for uh for the chair um
 
02:34:42.349 --> 02:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh I heard um representative Sullivan
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
talk about some people that I think are
 
02:34:47.910 --> 02:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
going to be following him testifying um
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I heard him say Amy
 
02:34:52.269 --> 02:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
Clark um director Clark's name from the
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
department but I do see her as a as an
 
02:34:58.110 --> 02:34:58.120 align:start position:0%
attendee at this meeting and I and I do
 
02:35:00.510 --> 02:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
know that the department does collect um
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
air quality uh information self-reported
 
02:35:07.309 --> 02:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
from school districts as as she um
 
02:35:09.469 --> 02:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
presented um well you remember Rick
 
02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
during the during the school funding
 
02:35:13.070 --> 02:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
commission so I was wondering if she was
 
02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
also going to be speaking this morning
 
02:35:19.670 --> 02:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
well we do have uh a clar available to
 
02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
us uh and the other part too is that
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
remember we did uh retain
 
02:35:28.590 --> 02:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
214 which deals with building
 
02:35:31.830 --> 02:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
construction build and at that time we
 
02:35:34.510 --> 02:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
reference the S money and I'll read uh
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
the 14th item that comes 14th um uh
 
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
directive that comes down and how we can
 
02:35:42.269 --> 02:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
use that money it says inspection
 
02:35:44.269 --> 02:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
testing maintenance repair replacement
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
and upgrade projects to improve the the
 
02:35:49.429 --> 02:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
indoor air quality in school facilities
 
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
including mechanical and nonmechanical
 
02:35:54.630 --> 02:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
heating ventilation and air conditioning
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
systems filtering purification and other
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
cleaning fans control systems and
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
windows door repair and replacement so
 
02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
that Esra money is wide open in terms of
 
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the issues which
 
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
represent solent is uh supporting and we
 
02:36:13.590 --> 02:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
also have that other bill which we
 
02:36:16.349 --> 02:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
retain with the thought looking at this
 
02:36:19.110 --> 02:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
broad picture of school building Aid and
 
02:36:21.070 --> 02:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining our
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
buildings do you have anything else add
 
02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
from that yeah yeah just just to add to
 
02:36:27.269 --> 02:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
that um Mr chair and and I absolutely
 
02:36:29.309 --> 02:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
agree with what what you just said there
 
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
except that money is not just up for
 
02:36:35.309 --> 02:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
grabs it um it it does get allocated out
 
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
on a you know on a basis that's not left
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
up to the uh to the local school
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
districts which I think brings even
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
greater importance to what um uh what
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan is talking about
 
02:36:48.030 --> 02:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
here in terms of working with
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
information we have and being able to
 
02:36:54.550 --> 02:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
assist um the um U the the executive
 
02:36:57.550 --> 02:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
branch in um in determining in directing
 
02:36:59.630 --> 02:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
where these funds were they're most
 
02:37:03.269 --> 02:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
needed yes you're correct that the funds
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
are coming down through the department
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and it
 
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
allows these local school districts they
 
02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
may use this funds these funds in a
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
direction that they feel that best you
 
02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
know directs efforts to correct some of
 
02:37:21.230 --> 02:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
the covid related concerns and it has to
 
02:37:23.110 --> 02:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
be Co related and that's where here
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
quity hops in there maybe the next thing
 
02:37:27.630 --> 02:37:27.640 align:start position:0%

Diane shuid I represent miramac 20 the
 
02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
towns of Pembrook and
 
02:38:30.790 --> 02:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
Chichester uh I had not actually signed
 
02:38:35.790 --> 02:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
up to speak I had justed uh in favor of
 
02:38:39.190 --> 02:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh the bill and as the co-sponsor uh I
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
feel it's a very important issue and as
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
has been stated this study would
 
02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
identify the best ways to use funds that
 
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
may be available and which schools uh
 
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
should be prioritized perhaps uh with
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
that I think probably
 
02:38:58.349 --> 02:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
questions uh would be better directed to
 
02:39:00.550 --> 02:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
some of the more expert folks that are
 
02:39:03.469 --> 02:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
waiting to speak thank you thank you
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
very much representative uh let's bring
 
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
up director from Department of
 
02:39:13.750 --> 02:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
educ uh Amy Clark you've been promoted
 
02:39:19.469 --> 02:39:19.479 align:start position:0%

are you there Amy I am can you hear me
 
02:39:25.469 --> 02:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
yes we can sorry about that actually
 
02:39:29.590 --> 02:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
just got booted off but I am back on so
 
02:39:31.710 --> 02:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Amy Clark
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm with the Department of Education
 
02:39:35.550 --> 02:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
I'm the administrator for the school
 
02:39:38.510 --> 02:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
safety and facility management Bureau
 
02:39:39.870 --> 02:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm really here just to take your
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
questions so I don't have any specific
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
testimony I think the only take-home
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
message I would say for for indoor air
 
02:39:48.750 --> 02:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
quality issues is that they existed
 
02:39:53.070 --> 02:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
before covid um so they are an ongoing
 
02:39:57.469 --> 02:39:57.479 align:start position:0%
issue whether it's mold or dust or
 
02:39:59.550 --> 02:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's maintenance issues or
 
02:40:03.030 --> 02:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
proper humidity control or proper air
 
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
Handling Systems all problems that
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
existed before
 
02:40:10.830 --> 02:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
Co is just much much tinier than some of
 
02:40:12.910 --> 02:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
the other pollutants that we're dealing
 
02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
with but makes it more challenging are
 
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
the questions reps on the no thank you
 
02:40:20.190 --> 02:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thank you very
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
much Miss Clark for joining us this
 
02:40:24.309 --> 02:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
morning um I was wondering if you could
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
just talk a little bit about the um the
 
02:40:30.349 --> 02:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
indoor air quality survey that uh that
 
02:40:33.309 --> 02:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
the department collects uh I think every
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
year and I know you've provided um to
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
the school funding commission and um uh
 
02:40:40.389 --> 02:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
if you could just sort of tell us what
 
02:40:42.469 --> 02:40:42.479 align:start position:0%
that's about and and some of the things
 
02:40:44.429 --> 02:40:44.439 align:start position:0%
that um that the Department's learned
 
02:40:46.269 --> 02:40:46.279 align:start position:0%
from that
 
02:40:48.990 --> 02:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
um sure um the requirement is that the
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
department put out this checklist which
 
02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
schools fill out every year um it was
 
02:40:57.590 --> 02:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
really a data collection tool um and
 
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
schools uh it's now on a more formal
 
02:41:01.870 --> 02:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
survey in the past few years we've
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
gotten much better reporting um on from
 
02:41:07.510 --> 02:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
school's reporting than in the past but
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
really it's just data collection there's
 
02:41:09.680 --> 02:41:11.790 align:start position:0%
really it's just data collection there's
no

02:41:11.790 --> 02:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
um if you know there's no followup on
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
that there's no no penalties there's no
 
02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
you know we just use it to talk to
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
schools when they have complaint issues
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
or something use it as a tool when we're
 
02:41:27.269 --> 02:41:27.279 align:start position:0%
doing their school approval
 
02:41:30.429 --> 02:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
work quick followup yes go ahead Mr
 
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
chair thanks so so thanks thanks very
 
02:41:35.870 --> 02:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
much Miss Clark um I I was also hoping
 
02:41:37.510 --> 02:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
you might be able to sort of comment on
 
02:41:39.150 --> 02:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
some of the things that that that you
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
see in that um survey such as some
 
02:41:44.590 --> 02:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
schools have very robust air handling
 
02:41:47.550 --> 02:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
and and um filtration systems while
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
other schools
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
um don't have those types of systems and
 
02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
don't even have the ability to um to do
 
02:42:01.110 --> 02:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
even a a single exchange of uh of of air
 
02:42:05.790 --> 02:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
um during the day um sure so that's um
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
that's true all as I think probably most
 
02:42:11.349 --> 02:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee knows is that um but
 
02:42:14.110 --> 02:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
just to restate that schools are all
 
02:42:15.910 --> 02:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
different and built in all different
 
02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
years there are building codes that
 
02:42:21.269 --> 02:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
require that they meet ashray standards
 
02:42:23.830 --> 02:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
which are essentially air quality
 
02:42:26.670 --> 02:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
standards and but it's at the time the
 
02:42:28.550 --> 02:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
building was constructed so you can
 
02:42:31.389 --> 02:42:31.399 align:start position:0%
imagine newer schools that are built um
 
02:42:34.870 --> 02:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
today um are at much different um
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
standards than schools that were built a
 
02:42:39.910 --> 02:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
100 years ago and some of them 50 years
 
02:42:41.990 --> 02:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
ago um a lot of our school buildings are
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
much older so you're not going to find a
 
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
building that was built 60 years ago
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
with um a robust air handling system um
 
02:42:51.870 --> 02:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
some schools have trouble just opening
 
02:42:54.990 --> 02:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
their windows I mean I'm not joking they
 
02:42:57.910 --> 02:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
have tools that they've developed from
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
facility managers being creative and
 
02:43:03.910 --> 02:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
finding a poll with a hook and try to um
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
get that door or window open um and some
 
02:43:10.990 --> 02:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
schools burn up in the September and
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
some schools freeze in certain days of
 
02:43:16.670 --> 02:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
year so yeah the built in the last 10
 
02:43:18.469 --> 02:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
years will look a lot different than
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
schools built 50 years ago for sure air
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:27.389 --> 02:43:27.399 align:start position:0%
especially you
 
02:43:30.190 --> 02:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman Miss
 
02:43:32.309 --> 02:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
clar thank you for taking my question um
 
02:43:34.110 --> 02:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
just on
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
a geez I'm sorry
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.279 --> 02:43:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
go

02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:55.510 --> 02:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
down I'm sorry Mr
 
02:43:57.870 --> 02:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
Woodcock go ahead yeah thank you I don't
 
02:43:58.830 --> 02:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
know what happened I want spinning
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
around here um seems to my status don't
 
02:44:05.070 --> 02:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
laugh Mullen um M Clark thank you so
 
02:44:06.910 --> 02:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
much for taking the question just in
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
general terms um from your annual review
 
02:44:13.469 --> 02:44:13.479 align:start position:0%
reports and data about how many schools
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
do you think uh percentage was 20 40 90
 
02:44:19.710 --> 02:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
Z need uh a change an upgrade in air
 
02:44:22.990 --> 02:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
quality HVAC systems in our in our
 
02:44:26.429 --> 02:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
state I can get you a better number I
 
02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
actually do have some of those numbers
 
02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have them available at my
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
fingertips um but the when I looked at
 
02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
the survey data so um to back up this
 
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
survey comes out every year at in about
 
02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
April is time frame so our survey isn't
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
really geared toward um questions covid
 
02:44:50.750 --> 02:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
related questions because came up last
 
02:44:53.230 --> 02:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
April whereas this year we'll ask a
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
little bit better question suited to
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we're looking
 
02:44:59.750 --> 02:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
for but um I remember looking through
 
02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
that data and I wasn't able to determine
 
02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh I I'll get you that data there was
 
02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
some question about it but in general
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's a significant amount of
 
02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
schools that
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind that you can't just put
 
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
a new air handling system in a school
 
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
and expect the school walls the whole
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
the building itself to be able to um
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
produce the air exchange that you're
 
02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
looking for um it really goes down to
 
02:45:30.429 --> 02:45:30.439 align:start position:0%
Major construction and renovation
 
02:45:32.190 --> 02:45:32.200 align:start position:0%
projects that will be able to address
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
their air quality issues um but let me
 
02:45:36.910 --> 02:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
get you some numbers to you and I will
 
02:45:38.429 --> 02:45:38.439 align:start position:0%
email the committee and it's essentially
 
02:45:40.910 --> 02:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
numbers of people who have being able to
 
02:45:42.990 --> 02:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
have fresh air and those who don't okay
 
02:45:45.230 --> 02:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
just to follow representative lad go
 
02:45:48.110 --> 02:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
ahead Miss Clark um please don't invest
 
02:45:49.469 --> 02:45:49.479 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of time digging out that
 
02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
data um but thank you I was just looking
 
02:45:53.790 --> 02:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
for a general a general opinion based on
 
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
your ongoing knowledge yeah yeah I
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
actually do have that data available
 
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
quite quickly but I appreciate thank you
 
02:46:03.469 --> 02:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there further
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:46:08.190 --> 02:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
Department Amy I have one for you um
 
02:46:10.269 --> 02:46:10.279 align:start position:0%
when you do this survey are you also
 
02:46:13.950 --> 02:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
surveying the 28 quer technical centers
 
02:46:15.950 --> 02:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
and the facilities they have I know some
 
02:46:18.750 --> 02:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
are in wonderful facilities others are
 
02:46:21.469 --> 02:46:21.479 align:start position:0%
are are in rooms much like a
 
02:46:24.190 --> 02:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
classroom uh for the most part yes we
 
02:46:25.990 --> 02:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
have a couple of Standalone Career and
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
Technical education centers that are not
 
02:46:30.469 --> 02:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
included in that survey but high schools
 
02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
are I presume are answering the when the
 
02:46:34.990 --> 02:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
high school fills it out they're they're
 
02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
addressing the whole High School I
 
02:46:39.190 --> 02:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
presume we don't separate out between
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
CTE centers in high schools but the
 
02:46:44.590 --> 02:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
Standalone CTE centers I imagine are not
 
02:46:44.600 --> 02:46:46.550 align:start position:0%
Standalone CTE centers I imagine are not
included

02:46:46.550 --> 02:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
included
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
I of at
 
02:46:51.710 --> 02:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
least thank you are there further
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
Department okay there's a question
 
02:46:58.030 --> 02:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
represent you have a question yes thank
 
02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
you chairman thank you m CLK um I was
 
02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if you were involved at all in
 
02:47:06.190 --> 02:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
the review of the plans that are
 
02:47:10.389 --> 02:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
submitted by by districts for use of the
 
02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
Esser PLS um I am not I'm not um our
 
02:47:16.750 --> 02:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
administrator for that is Katie Murphy
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
who is handling that and that does not
 
02:47:22.110 --> 02:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
currently come through my office
 
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
um if she's on the phone she could
 
02:47:26.830 --> 02:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
certainly correct me if I'm wrong but
 
02:47:29.950 --> 02:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
from what I understand sr1 versus sr2
 
02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
sr2 is now involves some construction
 
02:47:35.830 --> 02:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
where sr1 funds did not and so I'm not
 
02:47:38.110 --> 02:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
sure if those details are still being
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
worked out uh but for the most part uh I
 
02:47:42.910 --> 02:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't I don't believe that they'll get
 
02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
any official facility review through the
 
02:47:47.230 --> 02:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
department it will be that the schools
 
02:47:48.990 --> 02:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
are identifying their needs and
 
02:47:51.870 --> 02:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
installing what they need it's a a
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
little federal funds require uh
 
02:47:56.469 --> 02:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
different construction standards um than
 
02:47:58.269 --> 02:47:58.279 align:start position:0%
State funds do for example they have to
 
02:48:01.550 --> 02:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
follow Davis bacon rules and um and
 
02:48:03.349 --> 02:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
other standards for federal funding that
 
02:48:04.870 --> 02:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
schools are not used to going through
 
02:48:06.269 --> 02:48:06.279 align:start position:0%
because there's not been any federal
 
02:48:08.830 --> 02:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
funding for construction um so that
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit of um things that
 
02:48:13.190 --> 02:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
they may get up to speed with but they
 
02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't go for my
 
02:48:18.750 --> 02:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you very
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
much next we have Jennifer given uh
 
02:48:27.469 --> 02:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
representing herself go ahead you've
 
02:48:27.479 --> 02:48:28.910 align:start position:0%
representing herself go ahead you've
been

02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:48:31.070 --> 02:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
promoted good morning thank you so much
 
02:48:33.550 --> 02:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
for taking the time to hear my testimony
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
um I really appreciate it especially
 
02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
right before lunch um so I am a teacher
 
02:48:40.870 --> 02:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
I am also the president of the uh
 
02:48:42.790 --> 02:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
Teachers Association at Hollis and
 
02:48:45.150 --> 02:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
Brooklyn uh Cooperative District I teach
 
02:48:48.830 --> 02:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
at the high school uh I can speak to uh
 
02:48:50.670 --> 02:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
kind of the firsthand account if you
 
02:48:54.110 --> 02:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
will of the experience that we have as
 
02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh people who are uh working within a
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
school our school was built um to kind
 
02:49:01.630 --> 02:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
of dub tail on a couple of the other
 
02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
comments uh about 25 years ago uh so we
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
I think might be kind of that um case
 
02:49:10.230 --> 02:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
study of we're not modern in terms of
 
02:49:12.910 --> 02:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
our um infrastructure but we are
 
02:49:14.269 --> 02:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
certainly not the one that's going to
 
02:49:17.429 --> 02:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
fall apart anytime soon and so um in
 
02:49:19.150 --> 02:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
some ways we're we're in the worst
 
02:49:21.790 --> 02:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
position because we would not qualify
 
02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps for some of that emergency um
 
02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
priority construction whereas um you
 
02:49:29.670 --> 02:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
know we are definitely struggling with
 
02:49:32.469 --> 02:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
some significant air quality issues um
 
02:49:35.630 --> 02:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
so just to kind of uh give you a sense
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
of the impact um Every Spring and then
 
02:49:42.150 --> 02:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
of course in every in the fall uh we
 
02:49:45.429 --> 02:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
enter into the building um buildings are
 
02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh we have conflicting protocols so one
 
02:49:49.950 --> 02:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
of the things that we need to do is keep
 
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
Kids Safe which of course we all would
 
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
support that means every afternoon we
 
02:49:56.429 --> 02:49:56.439 align:start position:0%
need to lock the building down close
 
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
windows shut everything up um that kind
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
of flies in the face of this competing
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
need for improved air quality which I
 
02:50:06.030 --> 02:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
mean if you grew up in New Hampshire
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
like I did the trick for when we were
 
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
little was open up all the windows at
 
02:50:11.630 --> 02:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
night let the cooler air kind of flow
 
02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
through then shut them all up in the
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
morning and like have the building kind
 
02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
of cool off we do the exact opposite um
 
02:50:21.510 --> 02:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
and we do that because we need to to
 
02:50:24.469 --> 02:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
keep the building secure of course we do
 
02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
but we are even limited in our um kind
 
02:50:31.590 --> 02:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
of DIY air quality efforts by um by some
 
02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
of those restrictions for for things
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
like that we are also limited like uh I
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
was told a couple years ago we can't
 
02:50:38.950 --> 02:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
have any more classroom fans because
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
they spread allergens right and they can
 
02:50:45.309 --> 02:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
but we are also then competing against
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
the okay but we're all incredibly
 
02:50:50.309 --> 02:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable it's really hot and humid
 
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
and the kid with asthma is being
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
triggered by that condition and so
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
schools really do desperately need a
 
02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
standard that is um adopted and then
 
02:51:04.110 --> 02:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
enforced uh and then of course we need
 
02:51:06.590 --> 02:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
the support to help uh get that
 
02:51:09.269 --> 02:51:09.279 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place um right now
 
02:51:11.229 --> 02:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
what happens is in the fall we run
 
02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
things like SATs and in the spring we
 
02:51:15.870 --> 02:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
run some high stakes Tes in both of
 
02:51:17.550 --> 02:51:17.560 align:start position:0%
which those conditions we tend to put
 
02:51:20.110 --> 02:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
kids into a space where it's really hot
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
and sticky and we know from um
 
02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
developmental psychology studies that
 
02:51:27.389 --> 02:51:27.399 align:start position:0%
their cognitive ability drops so we're
 
02:51:30.990 --> 02:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
pairing all of these competing demands
 
02:51:33.910 --> 02:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
on these kids uh and it's it's just
 
02:51:36.750 --> 02:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
really unfair um kids don't have an
 
02:51:38.950 --> 02:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
option to not attend school of course
 
02:51:41.110 --> 02:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
this year we can attend in a myriad of
 
02:51:44.670 --> 02:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
ways but typically they are required to
 
02:51:47.150 --> 02:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
attend and be in the building and again
 
02:51:49.229 --> 02:51:49.239 align:start position:0%
I agree with that but what they don't
 
02:51:52.150 --> 02:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
then have is any control over their own
 
02:51:54.389 --> 02:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
um experience in that day when it comes
 
02:51:57.269 --> 02:51:57.279 align:start position:0%
to temperature or air quality and so
 
02:51:59.150 --> 02:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
they can be exposed to all sorts of
 
02:52:01.469 --> 02:52:01.479 align:start position:0%
things um and they're required to be
 
02:52:04.190 --> 02:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
there so for me it's a um it's a health
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
issue but it's a moral issue and it's a
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
learning issue kids do not learn well
 
02:52:12.229 --> 02:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
when they are um hot and uncomfortable
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
or when they feel like they can't
 
02:52:16.030 --> 02:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
breathe well and we have a lot of data
 
02:52:17.710 --> 02:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
that supports that and we also have a
 
02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
lot of data that supports um the
 
02:52:22.950 --> 02:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
increase to our health office visits uh
 
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
really spikes on on those hot days with
 
02:52:27.590 --> 02:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
dizzy and nausea and headaches and you
 
02:52:30.030 --> 02:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
know all of those things um but then
 
02:52:32.349 --> 02:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
also the social and emotional if you are
 
02:52:36.550 --> 02:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
a teenage kid um you are hyper aware of
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
how you look who you're sitting next to
 
02:52:41.389 --> 02:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff um and if you're
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
hot and sticky you're you're even more
 
02:52:45.830 --> 02:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
distracted from the learning that you're
 
02:52:49.269 --> 02:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing right like um I
 
02:52:51.150 --> 02:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
have a couple of teenagers who I live
 
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
with and I can attest I can attest to
 
02:52:56.910 --> 02:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that they are very much aware
 
02:52:59.309 --> 02:52:59.319 align:start position:0%
of how they look at any particular
 
02:53:02.550 --> 02:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
moment um and the perception of that and
 
02:53:04.510 --> 02:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
also you can really tell the difference
 
02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
between kids who um socioeconomic
 
02:53:10.309 --> 02:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
backgrounds who who can kind of manage
 
02:53:11.429 --> 02:53:11.439 align:start position:0%
those things a little bit more
 
02:53:13.710 --> 02:53:13.720 align:start position:0%
comfortably than others they might have
 
02:53:16.150 --> 02:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
um their personal fans and like you know
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
all those things that come with them um
 
02:53:21.429 --> 02:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
and so you I would argue that we really
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
need uh the state to intervene because
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
at the local level we are putting out
 
02:53:29.790 --> 02:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
the most immediate fire right and this
 
02:53:32.830 --> 02:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
year that's covid um and so all of our
 
02:53:34.870 --> 02:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
Focus has really gone there which has
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
meant that all the other goals that we
 
02:53:40.469 --> 02:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
might want to meet need to take a back
 
02:53:42.349 --> 02:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
burner we we just don't have the
 
02:53:45.990 --> 02:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to do all of the things and so
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
it would be lovely if the state of New
 
02:53:51.269 --> 02:53:51.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um got us some really solid
 
02:53:54.870 --> 02:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
data to to kind of use as a way to then
 
02:53:56.990 --> 02:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
gauge how much mitigation efforts we
 
02:53:59.990 --> 02:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
really need um and then hopefully uh
 
02:54:01.830 --> 02:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
require some of that so that students
 
02:54:03.910 --> 02:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
can have the health benefits of of
 
02:54:07.349 --> 02:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:09.790 --> 02:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
building thank you very much are there
 
02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
question welcome you're welcome for
 
02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
missg just a quick one yes repr Lun
 
02:54:19.630 --> 02:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
thanks very much um Mr chair thank you
 
02:54:21.590 --> 02:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
very much Miss given for joining us this
 
02:54:24.630 --> 02:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
morning um so would you classify um
 
02:54:27.150 --> 02:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
indoor air quality as both a health
 
02:54:30.190 --> 02:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
issue and as well as a student Equity
 
02:54:35.070 --> 02:54:35.080 align:start position:0%
issue absolutely um because students who
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
are able to um cool off are are going to
 
02:54:41.550 --> 02:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
be able to learn better sometimes that
 
02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
can't happen at home and that should
 
02:54:46.389 --> 02:54:46.399 align:start position:0%
happen in the building right like that's
 
02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
the one space that we can actually offer
 
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
an equal playing field um and what we
 
02:54:53.469 --> 02:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
are really doing is kind of the opposite
 
02:54:54.830 --> 02:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're taking all these kids from
 
02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
different maybe they had advantages at
 
02:54:57.750 --> 02:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
home and then we're putting them in a
 
02:54:59.429 --> 02:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged environment and giving
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
them high St Tess um so I guess that's a
 
02:55:03.710 --> 02:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
way to equalize the playing field but I
 
02:55:05.349 --> 02:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
don't think that's what we intended you
 
02:55:08.309 --> 02:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
know um so it would be it would be
 
02:55:11.309 --> 02:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
lovely if kids if schools were places
 
02:55:14.750 --> 02:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
that were physically safe in all way not
 
02:55:16.510 --> 02:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
just from you know we we do a lot of
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
lockdown or active shooter drills but it
 
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
also needs to be safe in like the
 
02:55:24.710 --> 02:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
daytoday kind of mundane ways of
 
02:55:29.269 --> 02:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
comfortable and and reasonable air um
 
02:55:31.950 --> 02:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
you know that people learn and work
 
02:55:35.910 --> 02:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
better when they are not freezing or hot
 
02:55:38.910 --> 02:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
so um or it can take a deep breath which
 
02:55:40.990 --> 02:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
is also a good
 
02:55:47.750 --> 02:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:49.910 --> 02:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
02:55:52.190 --> 02:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you so much for
 
02:55:55.790 --> 02:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
having me I appreciate it wel uh we
 
02:55:57.309 --> 02:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
don't have anyone else signed up to
 
02:55:59.750 --> 02:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
testify but there is uh an attendee who
 
02:56:01.309 --> 02:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
has his hand
 
02:56:01.319 --> 02:56:03.030 align:start position:0%
has his hand
raised

02:56:03.030 --> 02:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
raised
 
02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:13.110 --> 02:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay go ahead uh Brian welcome to
 
02:56:13.120 --> 02:56:18.750 align:start position:0%
okay okay go ahead uh Brian welcome to
education

02:56:18.750 --> 02:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:20.469 --> 02:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman can
 
02:56:24.309 --> 02:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
everybody hear me okay yes great um I'll
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
try and be brief um uh want to thank
 
02:56:29.389 --> 02:56:29.399 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan for bringing the
 
02:56:32.110 --> 02:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
bill forward um we're in full support of
 
02:56:33.510 --> 02:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
339 um you know who knew this bill would
 
02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
take on a whole another meeting meeing
 
02:56:42.229 --> 02:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
than when this came before uh this
 
02:56:44.910 --> 02:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh just a year ago
 
02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
um you I think what uh Jen just
 
02:56:51.870 --> 02:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
described um again uh sort of taking on
 
02:56:54.510 --> 02:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
a whole new meeting um this was an issue
 
02:56:57.389 --> 02:56:57.399 align:start position:0%
the issue of air quality in our schools
 
02:57:00.349 --> 02:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic um it's been an
 
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
issue during the pandemic and I think
 
02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
the value of having this study committee
 
02:57:08.030 --> 02:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
is to help ensure um that we can take a
 
02:57:10.950 --> 02:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
hard look at this so that it is not an
 
02:57:13.150 --> 02:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
issue continuing to be an issue going
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
forward when we exit the pandemic um she
 
02:57:20.590 --> 02:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
gave some good examples of of you know
 
02:57:22.269 --> 02:57:22.279 align:start position:0%
issues non-co
 
02:57:24.750 --> 02:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
related uh that that that has persisted
 
02:57:29.469 --> 02:57:29.479 align:start position:0%
in our um schools I mean like issues of
 
02:57:31.790 --> 02:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know like structural issues such
 
02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:32.630 align:start position:0%
uh you know like structural issues such
as

02:57:32.630 --> 02:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:57:34.510 --> 02:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
Broadband um you know we ought to come
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
out of this pandemic you know stronger
 
02:57:40.750 --> 02:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
for our kids um than we did going in and
 
02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
um I I uh I believe you have some
 
02:57:47.550 --> 02:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
written comments from um Lori Hayes
 
02:57:50.030 --> 02:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
who's one of our uh uniserve directors
 
02:57:52.349 --> 02:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
she works with a particular region of of
 
02:57:56.110 --> 02:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
the state um just just one of of 10
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
regions um and she cites some some you
 
02:58:02.990 --> 02:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
know scary examples of of of issues of
 
02:58:06.389 --> 02:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
prepandemic air quality um that I can
 
02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
tell you there are issues all over the
 
02:58:12.389 --> 02:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
state um that that mirror some of those
 
02:58:15.229 --> 02:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh I think Miss Clark you know
 
02:58:17.429 --> 02:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
referenced it in her comments earlier
 
02:58:19.229 --> 02:58:19.239 align:start position:0%
that you know we have a lot of old
 
02:58:21.830 --> 02:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
buildings in the state and and with that
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
comes um a myriad of issues including um
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
including this so you know uh some of
 
02:58:31.710 --> 02:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
those uh conditions so you know you can
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
you can lead in um in Lor's written
 
02:58:37.269 --> 02:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh would certainly be
 
02:58:39.670 --> 02:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the the committee
 
02:58:43.790 --> 02:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
should it be become law um one piece of
 
02:58:46.429 --> 02:58:46.439 align:start position:0%
that that I'll just uh uh reference very
 
02:58:48.790 --> 02:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
quickly uh and representative Sullivan
 
02:58:50.990 --> 02:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
brought up is uh the Harvard School
 
02:58:52.389 --> 02:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
study from
 
02:58:57.229 --> 02:58:57.239 align:start position:0%
2017 um which states that um the quality
 
02:58:59.070 --> 02:58:59.080 align:start position:0%
and characteristics of our schools have
 
02:59:01.750 --> 02:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
an outsized impact on the health of our
 
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
students um by the time a student
 
02:59:06.469 --> 02:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
graduates from high school uh she or he
 
02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
has spent 15,600 hours inside a school
 
02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh maybe not this year but um and amount
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
of time uh second only to that at home
 
02:59:18.309 --> 02:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
and that there are nationwide there's
 
02:59:20.190 --> 02:59:20.200 align:start position:0%
more than 50 million K through 12
 
02:59:23.229 --> 02:59:23.239 align:start position:0%
students in the United States um the
 
02:59:25.990 --> 02:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
time spent in school is also a time of
 
02:59:28.190 --> 02:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
Rapid physical growth hormonal changes
 
02:59:32.389 --> 02:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
intense learning and as uh as as Jen um
 
02:59:33.550 --> 02:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
referenced you know critical
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
neurological and Social Development um
 
02:59:38.510 --> 02:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately you know poor air
 
02:59:42.150 --> 02:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
quality uh can take a toll on on that
 
02:59:44.950 --> 02:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
development um so I I I would hope that
 
02:59:46.110 --> 02:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
that would be a study that this
 
02:59:47.950 --> 02:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
committee would would would would look
 
02:59:51.950 --> 02:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
at um look at the laws and rules that
 
02:59:54.670 --> 02:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
may need updating as a result of this
 
02:59:57.429 --> 02:59:57.439 align:start position:0%
and then um just to to reference quickly
 
03:00:00.710 --> 03:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
the the circumstances that were in now
 
03:00:02.309 --> 03:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
the crisis we're in now with with
 
03:00:05.389 --> 03:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
respect to the pandemic um you know all
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
the Myriad of of standards that are out
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
there from the CDC um to the um to the
 
03:00:13.319 --> 03:00:14.389 align:start position:0%
there from the CDC um to the um to the
uh

03:00:14.389 --> 03:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:00:16.469 --> 03:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh to the ashray standards that Miss
 
03:00:20.229 --> 03:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
Clark uh referenced um you know there
 
03:00:21.790 --> 03:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
are some very specific uh
 
03:00:24.510 --> 03:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations guidelines in there um
 
03:00:26.990 --> 03:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
that I think you know committee and
 
03:00:30.349 --> 03:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
could help uh you know develop some
 
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
systems for ensuring that our schools
 
03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
have these you know some of the specific
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
ones would just include things like you
 
03:00:40.870 --> 03:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
know uh setting hbac systems uh at
 
03:00:45.150 --> 03:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
certain uh uh settings with respect to
 
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
outdoor air uh increasing U the air flow
 
03:00:51.950 --> 03:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
Supply to occupied spaces especially
 
03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
places like uh you know nursing uh
 
03:00:58.990 --> 03:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
nursing stations and schools um um and
 
03:01:02.469 --> 03:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
then uh you know also in the before and
 
03:01:06.269 --> 03:01:06.279 align:start position:0%
after period of the of the school day so
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
um again we think this bill is about um
 
03:01:12.269 --> 03:01:12.279 align:start position:0%
safety um safety for our students safety
 
03:01:14.670 --> 03:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
for our educators
 
03:01:17.469 --> 03:01:17.479 align:start position:0%
um we've heard that uh with respect to
 
03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
the pandemic Co is going to be around
 
03:01:23.469 --> 03:01:23.479 align:start position:0%
for a long time um even even after we're
 
03:01:26.229 --> 03:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
all most of us are vaccinated it will
 
03:01:29.950 --> 03:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
still be something that is uh is around
 
03:01:32.429 --> 03:01:32.439 align:start position:0%
and we should do our best to try and
 
03:01:34.750 --> 03:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
protect against that and as well as the
 
03:01:38.110 --> 03:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
next hopefully not for a long time but
 
03:01:40.269 --> 03:01:40.279 align:start position:0%
the next issue related to air quality
 
03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
whether that's something that's
 
03:01:43.710 --> 03:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
transmitted through the air or some some
 
03:01:45.510 --> 03:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the day-to-day issues that that that
 
03:01:47.910 --> 03:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
existed before so um I'll close my
 
03:01:52.150 --> 03:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
testimony there um and uh urge you to
 
03:01:55.550 --> 03:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
pass House Bill 339 thank you very much
 
03:01:57.670 --> 03:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Brian are there
 
03:02:00.510 --> 03:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hawkins not seeing any hands thank you
 
03:02:05.550 --> 03:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
very much okay appreciate your
 
03:02:08.510 --> 03:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
time okay that should take us through I
 
03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
I believe our testimony on on this
 
03:02:14.429 --> 03:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
particular bill can uh do you have the
 
03:02:17.710 --> 03:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
number of people that y yep uh we had 12
 
03:02:20.910 --> 03:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
signing and support 12 supporting zero

four bills left uh we're on 267 that's
 
03:46:37.469 --> 03:46:37.479 align:start position:0%
relative to construction standards for
 
03:46:41.269 --> 03:46:41.279 align:start position:0%
schools and represent PE is
 
03:46:44.590 --> 03:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
here to introduce the bill you're
 
03:46:47.510 --> 03:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
recognized representative thank
 
03:46:51.269 --> 03:46:51.279 align:start position:0%
you of the comme my name is Mark Pearson

but of particular relevance to this bill
 
03:47:10.870 --> 03:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
I share the advis com for the education
 
03:47:13.189 --> 03:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
of students who were de and part of
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
hearing a group which has six
 
03:47:18.750 --> 03:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees actively working on
 
03:47:21.070 --> 03:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
various aspects of the delivery of
 
03:47:22.830 --> 03:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
services to our death and heart of
 
03:47:24.670 --> 03:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
hearing students in New
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the members of this
 
03:47:29.550 --> 03:47:29.560 align:start position:0%
council is an educational
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
audiologist her travels throughout New
 
03:47:34.149 --> 03:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire she has discovered that many
 
03:47:36.070 --> 03:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
schools are exemplary in how they
 
03:47:38.070 --> 03:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
educate their children with this and
 
03:47:40.389 --> 03:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
with other studies
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
however she has discovered other schools
 
03:47:46.110 --> 03:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
that needs some help the purpose of our
 
03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
council is to identify specific areas of
 
03:47:52.910 --> 03:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
need so help can be better
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
rendered one area of concern is the
 
03:48:01.309 --> 03:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
noise generated by Antiquated hbac
 
03:48:04.149 --> 03:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
systems the special devices most of our
 
03:48:06.110 --> 03:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
deaf and hard hearing students can
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
participate in mainstream
 
03:48:12.030 --> 03:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
education however noisy hbac systems
 
03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
make learning quite difficult to despite
 
03:48:16.830 --> 03:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
those special
 
03:48:21.309 --> 03:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
devices her experience and recent
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
conversations with colleagues say that
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
as many as 60% of the HVAC systems do
 
03:48:29.910 --> 03:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
not meet
 
03:48:33.670 --> 03:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
standards Federal Law requires our
 
03:48:36.149 --> 03:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
schools to provide a proper atmosphere
 
03:48:39.950 --> 03:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
for learning some have suggested
 
03:48:43.469 --> 03:48:43.479 align:start position:0%
my commission or my councel or both um
 
03:48:45.990 --> 03:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
bring lawsuits against school
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
districts but both my commission my
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
councel and myself I prefer to alert
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
local officials to the problems and give
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
them some your
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
suffix bipartison House Bill 267 offers
 
03:49:02.269 --> 03:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
a way forward that is helpful to Heart
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
aing students and to do it in a way that
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
school districts can
 
03:49:11.590 --> 03:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
plan we do have standards for new
 
03:49:15.389 --> 03:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
buildings in terms of noise from H but
 
03:49:17.429 --> 03:49:17.439 align:start position:0%
not subsequent
 
03:49:19.750 --> 03:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
inspections to me this is like having
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
your car inspected when it's brand new
 
03:49:26.469 --> 03:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
on for lot but never having it
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
inspected there is some money available
 
03:49:32.550 --> 03:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
on Friday morning February 26 I spoke to
 
03:49:34.750 --> 03:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
Sten Murphy the department of
 
03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
education's administrator of new Co
 
03:49:40.670 --> 03:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
money available to schools
 
03:49:44.030 --> 03:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
Co pmic making us very much more aware
 
03:49:48.189 --> 03:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
of issues of ventilation and air quality
 
03:49:49.870 --> 03:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
and you heard a bill on that this
 
03:49:52.269 --> 03:49:52.279 align:start position:0%
morning I understand that some school
 
03:49:53.469 --> 03:49:53.479 align:start position:0%
districts are
 
03:49:56.469 --> 03:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
contemplating a thorough examination of
 
03:50:00.469 --> 03:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
how their HX system moves air
 
03:50:04.269 --> 03:50:04.279 align:start position:0%
around why not are they Antiquated and
 
03:50:04.279 --> 03:50:05.670 align:start position:0%
around why not are they Antiquated and
the

03:50:05.670 --> 03:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:09.349 --> 03:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
need some standard H systems May exess
 
03:50:11.110 --> 03:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
survey the transfer of the virus
 
03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the school and might not
 
03:50:16.990 --> 03:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
acccess noise be an indicator of
 
03:50:17.000 --> 03:50:18.750 align:start position:0%
acccess noise be an indicator of
substandard

03:50:18.750 --> 03:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
substandard
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
assists so there seems to be a need it
 
03:50:27.309 --> 03:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
will help students in need so they can
 
03:50:28.830 --> 03:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
continue to be
 
03:50:33.189 --> 03:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
M seems to be money available and on
 
03:50:35.070 --> 03:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
behalf of hard appearance students in
 
03:50:40.510 --> 03:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
our school I actually pass house bu to
 
03:50:42.750 --> 03:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much Mr
 
03:50:47.070 --> 03:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
represent pearon it's hard looking at
 
03:50:50.670 --> 03:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:53.710 --> 03:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
here thank you very much represent
 
03:50:55.710 --> 03:50:55.720 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions for
 
03:50:58.990 --> 03:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
represent pearon represent
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
wood thank you representative lad uh
 
03:51:02.910 --> 03:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you for
 
03:51:05.870 --> 03:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
taking the question just um just two two
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
I think um the first one is uh B looking
 
03:51:11.030 --> 03:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
at the dates the dates of this
 
03:51:14.189 --> 03:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
sequencing of the building in 2026 and
 
03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
the date of
 
03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
Passage if a school system
 
03:51:23.429 --> 03:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
today is halfway done a construction
 
03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
project uh and it'll be finished say in
 
03:51:31.590 --> 03:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
October of October
 
03:51:34.870 --> 03:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh and there be P the 60 days does that
 
03:51:37.349 --> 03:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
mean when you when you go to the 2026
 
03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
date you have here does that mean mean
 
03:51:41.149 --> 03:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
if they aren't in compliance they have
 
03:51:43.389 --> 03:51:43.399 align:start position:0%
to have it done by
 
03:51:47.189 --> 03:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
2026 if they're not in compliance now
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
has to be done by
 
03:51:53.950 --> 03:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
2026 follow up Mr chair yes you may so U
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the answer I wouldn't
 
03:51:58.269 --> 03:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
ask the question Mr pearon the the the
 
03:52:01.790 --> 03:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh Ani requirements that you site are
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
those currently being used by uh schools
 
03:52:07.870 --> 03:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
in New School design
 
03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
typically what I've been told is that
 
03:52:14.830 --> 03:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
when new schools are being built they
 
03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
have to meet those
 
03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
standards okay um old
 
03:52:26.110 --> 03:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
schs that's my concern okay and then one
 
03:52:27.870 --> 03:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
one final question I may Mr lad I won't
 
03:52:29.550 --> 03:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
ask any more of this candidate this
 
03:52:32.189 --> 03:52:32.199 align:start position:0%
person representative the the I'm
 
03:52:35.630 --> 03:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the standards for uh physical
 
03:52:37.349 --> 03:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
education teaching
 
03:52:40.910 --> 03:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
environment um and in some of the
 
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
smaller schools the elementary schools
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
often that physical education
 
03:52:49.229 --> 03:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
environment is also the uh cafeteria
 
03:52:51.030 --> 03:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
school lunch area or the school
 
03:52:51.040 --> 03:52:53.389 align:start position:0%
school lunch area or the school
auditorium

03:52:53.389 --> 03:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
auditorium
 
03:52:55.990 --> 03:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
so which which what are they using here
 
03:52:58.590 --> 03:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria noise level or and I don't
 
03:52:59.630 --> 03:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
know what I don't know what a physical
 
03:53:02.550 --> 03:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
education uh environment is in terms of
 
03:53:04.510 --> 03:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
the noise level where so much of that is
 
03:53:07.229 --> 03:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
is done in large gymnasiums even the new
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
school the large gymnasium versus
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh they the phys teachers teach in the
 
03:53:13.950 --> 03:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
gymnasium but it's it's used primarily
 
03:53:14.790 --> 03:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
as the
 
03:53:17.950 --> 03:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
gymnasium um or the small elementary
 
03:53:20.070 --> 03:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
schools they may teach fizet in the in
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria so can can you just give
 
03:53:24.910 --> 03:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
me some Enlightenment on that please
 
03:53:28.269 --> 03:53:28.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely not I hav AOL on but I would
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
suspect that students who have
 
03:53:34.149 --> 03:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
difficulty in hearing their classroom
 
03:53:38.149 --> 03:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
would probably not wisely be in an area
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
with a tremendous Echo that problem will
 
03:53:45.180 --> 03:53:45.190 align:start position:0%
pop up immediately long before any H
 
03:53:45.190 --> 03:53:49.269 align:start position:0%
pop up immediately long before any H

03:53:49.269 --> 03:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.149 --> 03:53:51.159 align:start position:0%
questions well I can highly hear your
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
answer but thank
 
03:53:58.630 --> 03:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:03.309 --> 03:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
up are there further questions ref
 
03:54:07.469 --> 03:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:11.950 --> 03:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:13.710 --> 03:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
Ellison thank
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:54:19.750 --> 03:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
represent for taking my question uh I I
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
just clarification should there be a
 
03:54:24.030 --> 03:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this bill or are you
 
03:54:26.590 --> 03:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
assuming that everything that's needed
 
03:54:28.670 --> 03:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
and required under the bill will be
 
03:54:30.670 --> 03:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
handled with covid funding that may be
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
coming forward I'm assuming that what
 
03:54:37.510 --> 03:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
this B asks for will be handled by
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
however simply because the standards
 
03:54:42.990 --> 03:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
that the federal laws require is an
 
03:54:47.110 --> 03:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
atmosphere conducive to learning and
 
03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:48.790 align:start position:0%
atmosphere conducive to learning and
um

03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:53.309 --> 03:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
LLY if the HVAC noise level doesn't get
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
fixed in school there were people
 
03:54:59.469 --> 03:54:59.479 align:start position:0%
prepared to do lawsuit so my concern was
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
not to go that well simply say schools I
 
03:55:04.070 --> 03:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
know a lot of schools are looking at
 
03:55:06.670 --> 03:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
their HS because they transfer air I
 
03:55:08.429 --> 03:55:08.439 align:start position:0%
know a lot of schools will conclude if
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
the h fact is noisy it's probably not
 
03:55:13.750 --> 03:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
doing a good job I also know that I'm
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
told that thereal money coming for
 
03:55:22.269 --> 03:55:22.279 align:start position:0%
school to change things because of Co
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I also know that there's um
 
03:55:27.030 --> 03:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
according to the Department of
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
education's administrator of the new Co
 
03:55:33.750 --> 03:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
money uh to point out that an air
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
exchange system in school needs to be
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
tested and brought up to Cod
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
is exactly what a CO kind of use of
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
money would be which is a long way of
 
03:55:46.429 --> 03:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
saying we don't think there needed to be
 
03:55:46.439 --> 03:55:47.469 align:start position:0%
saying we don't think there needed to be
a

03:55:47.469 --> 03:55:47.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:55:49.309 --> 03:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
fisal thank
 
03:55:51.389 --> 03:55:51.399 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions
 
03:55:54.429 --> 03:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
represent M yes thank you Mr chairman
 
03:55:56.110 --> 03:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Pearson for
 
03:55:58.830 --> 03:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um representative
 
03:56:03.710 --> 03:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
Woodcock alluded to the uh August 1 2026
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
deadline for compliance for existing
 
03:56:10.070 --> 03:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
buildings Roman three of your bill line
 
03:56:12.630 --> 03:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
20 says a school district May request a
 
03:56:14.389 --> 03:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
waiver from the Department of Ed for
 
03:56:17.349 --> 03:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
meeting the requirements in this
 
03:56:20.710 --> 03:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
section um I'm a little confused as to
 
03:56:23.710 --> 03:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're saying two opposite
 
03:56:26.870 --> 03:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
things one they must comply by 2026 and
 
03:56:30.790 --> 03:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
two they can get a a waiver or is there
 
03:56:33.229 --> 03:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
something in section three is that's
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
being waved that isn't stated in the
 
03:56:39.229 --> 03:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
bill um my reading of it is that a
 
03:56:41.429 --> 03:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
school district can request anything
 
03:56:43.830 --> 03:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
they want and if the Department of
 
03:56:45.910 --> 03:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
Education doesn't think it's a very good
 
03:56:49.269 --> 03:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:52.870 --> 03:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
waiver I think the reason that I was
 
03:56:55.950 --> 03:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
asked to put in that is we don't know
 
03:56:59.870 --> 03:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
what we don't know and we may encounter
 
03:57:02.790 --> 03:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
something quite odd down the road where
 
03:57:06.349 --> 03:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
a waiver would make sense on a one-time
 
03:57:10.149 --> 03:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
basis okay thank you uh represent
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:19.389 --> 03:57:19.399 align:start position:0%
repres my question is about the learning
 
03:57:21.950 --> 03:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
spaces used as a primary education space
 
03:57:24.349 --> 03:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
for a child who death or heart of
 
03:57:27.070 --> 03:57:27.080 align:start position:0%
hearing uh would that child be moving
 
03:57:27.080 --> 03:57:28.030 align:start position:0%
hearing uh would that child be moving
from

03:57:28.030 --> 03:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
classroom that's in line 16 and 17 would
 
03:57:33.070 --> 03:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
the child be moving from classroom to
 
03:57:34.590 --> 03:57:34.600 align:start position:0%
classroom and is that something that
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
then would be harder to accomplish I
 
03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:43.830 --> 03:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
I would assume that if there is a
 
03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
classroom where proper delivery of
 
03:57:51.870 --> 03:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
instruction to a child who has hearing
 
03:57:54.030 --> 03:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
difficulties the child would not be put
 
03:57:55.710 --> 03:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
in that room either the problem would be
 
03:57:59.550 --> 03:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
fixed or accommodations would be made
 
03:58:02.590 --> 03:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
right now I am told by people
 
03:58:06.110 --> 03:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
who there are some schools where that's
 
03:58:09.870 --> 03:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
being done but you know the higher up
 
03:58:11.950 --> 03:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
you go and the more a child changes
 
03:58:14.469 --> 03:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
classes there can be a bit of a problem
 
03:58:18.590 --> 03:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
there and this V just says fix the
 
03:58:20.429 --> 03:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
problem thank
 
03:58:23.710 --> 03:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
you are there further
 
03:58:25.870 --> 03:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
questions not see any hands thank you
 
03:58:27.550 --> 03:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
very much our
 
03:58:29.870 --> 03:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative okay next we have uh
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
Linda Taylor she has um signed in and
 
03:58:39.870 --> 03:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
support and uh
 
03:58:42.269 --> 03:58:42.279 align:start position:0%
she she has indicated zero minutes but I
 
03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
have a feeling it's probably going to be
 
03:58:45.430 --> 03:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
longer than
 
03:58:45.440 --> 03:58:48.149 align:start position:0%
longer than
[Music]

03:58:48.149 --> 03:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:58:50.790 --> 03:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
that hi thank you very much for allowing
 
03:58:53.469 --> 03:58:53.479 align:start position:0%
me to speak um I'm Linda Taylor and I'm
 
03:58:54.990 --> 03:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
a teacher of Da and heart of hearing
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
students and I've been working in the
 
03:58:59.590 --> 03:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
state since 1997 as an educational
 
03:59:02.110 --> 03:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
consultant and itinerant teacher um I
 
03:59:04.189 --> 03:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
have degrees uh including a doctorate
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
from Boston University in this area um
 
03:59:09.429 --> 03:59:09.439 align:start position:0%
and I'm speaking here here in favor of
 
03:59:12.510 --> 03:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
HP 267 because I know how important good
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
Acoustics are for both me and my
 
03:59:18.149 --> 03:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
students um the NC standards for
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
classroom Acoustics have already been
 
03:59:22.990 --> 03:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
adopted by um Connecticut and Minnesota
 
03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
and um some cities including New York
 
03:59:28.269 --> 03:59:28.279 align:start position:0%
city so that answers um the
 
03:59:30.510 --> 03:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative's earlier
 
03:59:33.870 --> 03:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
question however somewhere around 30% of
 
03:59:35.750 --> 03:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
classrooms today have been found to meet
 
03:59:40.349 --> 03:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
those standards um they hope us here by
 
03:59:43.870 --> 03:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
reducing background noise to a level uh
 
03:59:48.550 --> 03:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
akin to a very quiet spoken um voice of
 
03:59:52.309 --> 03:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
35db um they suggest Renovations using
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
less permeable doors and windows um and
 
03:59:57.750 --> 03:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
they reduce reverberation or Echo time
 
04:00:01.830 --> 04:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
to um a manageable um amount of time I
 
04:00:04.510 --> 04:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
found in my experience traveling around
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um that poor Acoustics are
 
04:00:08.630 --> 04:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
a major impediment to the effect Ive
 
04:00:10.229 --> 04:00:10.239 align:start position:0%
education of De and hard fairing
 
04:00:13.030 --> 04:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
students and that alone would justify
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation however foring
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
Acoustics also hinder the education of
 
04:00:20.790 --> 04:00:20.800 align:start position:0%
children with perfect tearing um
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
especially those under 13 our brains
 
04:00:24.910 --> 04:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
haven't developed enough to be able to
 
04:00:27.070 --> 04:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
push away background noise and Home in
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
on what we want to hear um and it also
 
04:00:33.189 --> 04:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
impedes the education of English
 
04:00:35.429 --> 04:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
language Learners and then students with
 
04:00:39.229 --> 04:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
other disabilities such as attention
 
04:00:42.910 --> 04:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
so that is one side of it the other side
 
04:00:45.750 --> 04:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
is that um teachers are straining to
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
have their voices heard over um
 
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
background noise and so we know that um
 
04:00:54.309 --> 04:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
teachers have a 20% greater risk of
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
damaging their voices more than other
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
professions just because they're trying
 
04:01:01.269 --> 04:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
so hard to project to the back row you
 
04:01:03.469 --> 04:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
add open doors and windows with covid
 
04:01:05.550 --> 04:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
you add masks with covid and the
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
teachers themselves are taking more sick
 
04:01:09.630 --> 04:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
days than they would normally have to
 
04:01:11.550 --> 04:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
wear Acoustics to be
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
better I like to draw the the comparison
 
04:01:18.269 --> 04:01:18.279 align:start position:0%
to a classroom that is lit by one single
 
04:01:21.870 --> 04:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
40 watt light bulb the teacher can hear
 
04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
the front row the teacher can see the
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
front row can see but the kids in the
 
04:01:28.229 --> 04:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
back or the middle of the classroom are
 
04:01:30.429 --> 04:01:30.439 align:start position:0%
going to be squinting to follow what's
 
04:01:33.149 --> 04:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
going on and in some classrooms that 40
 
04:01:35.870 --> 04:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
watt light bulb is what is going on
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
acoustically um we wouldn't accept this
 
04:01:42.510 --> 04:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
in a classroom um but research um on
 
04:01:45.870 --> 04:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
classrooms close to highways and Subway
 
04:01:49.229 --> 04:01:49.239 align:start position:0%
systems have found that um children have
 
04:01:51.910 --> 04:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
a one-year drop in academic achievement
 
04:01:54.189 --> 04:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
for every additional 10 dbb of
 
04:01:54.199 --> 04:01:56.710 align:start position:0%
for every additional 10 dbb of
background

04:01:56.710 --> 04:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:59.070 --> 04:01:59.080 align:start position:0%
noise there is at least one school in
 
04:02:01.670 --> 04:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um where the HVAC noise
 
04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
level in an empty classroom has been
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
measured at 60 DB that's a
 
04:02:10.349 --> 04:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
conversational speed each level if you
 
04:02:12.910 --> 04:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
think about that that translates to two
 
04:02:16.189 --> 04:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
years of delay in academics if you
 
04:02:19.229 --> 04:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
extrapolate from that research so poor
 
04:02:21.149 --> 04:02:21.159 align:start position:0%
Acoustics are a significant barrier to
 
04:02:22.510 --> 04:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
learning in my
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
opinion um I was involved in writing
 
04:02:24.960 --> 04:02:25.870 align:start position:0%
opinion um I was involved in writing
rule

04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
rule
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
32121 in this area in
 
04:02:32.830 --> 04:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
2005 little has happened since um it
 
04:02:36.030 --> 04:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
seems that uh new and renovated schools
 
04:02:37.830 --> 04:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
don't consider Acoustics important
 
04:02:40.149 --> 04:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
enough to include um and they're
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
definitely not a priority I'm hopeful
 
04:02:44.950 --> 04:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
that this legislation will pass and then
 
04:02:46.830 --> 04:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
create the teeth we need to provide all
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
of our students the learning environment
 
04:02:52.349 --> 04:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
that they and all of our death in the
 
04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
heart of hearing students need thank you
 
04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very much Miss

her thank you and representative Hobson
 
04:03:48.070 --> 04:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
I just suck my hand up while you were
 
04:03:51.070 --> 04:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
looking down so I would being easy um
 
04:03:52.950 --> 04:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for not signing in to
 
04:03:55.950 --> 04:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
testify um when I went to do so too late
 
04:03:58.189 --> 04:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry about that uh I do just
 
04:03:59.670 --> 04:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
want to point out again for the record
 
04:04:01.389 --> 04:04:01.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Amy Clark and I'm with the
 
04:04:04.590 --> 04:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and um we are
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill but I do just want
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
to point out a couple of things um with
 
04:04:15.750 --> 04:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
this bill um keep in mind um Ed 321 are
 
04:04:18.590 --> 04:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
our um regulations on minimum
 
04:04:21.309 --> 04:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
construction standards currently there
 
04:04:24.149 --> 04:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
is already a requirement for schools
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
that are under construction to meet this
 
04:04:26.000 --> 04:04:27.229 align:start position:0%
that are under construction to meet this
ansy

04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
ansy
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
regulation uh and if I recall the last
 
04:04:31.870 --> 04:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
time this regulation was updated was
 
04:04:34.750 --> 04:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
Medan 2010 meaning the an standard I
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
think was um most um recently updated in
 
04:04:43.070 --> 04:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
2010 um so when a building is goes under
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
construction with building Aid uh they
 
04:04:49.110 --> 04:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
come through our office and we review
 
04:04:51.750 --> 04:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
those standards and we have a sign off
 
04:04:54.070 --> 04:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
on an architect from the architect that
 
04:04:56.670 --> 04:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
it meets those acoustic
 
04:04:59.750 --> 04:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
standards the regulation requires that
 
04:05:02.189 --> 04:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
all buildings meet this with or without
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
building Aid so however there's just no
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
oversight from the Department without
 
04:05:11.469 --> 04:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
any um State funds involved um so I just
 
04:05:15.189 --> 04:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
want to point that out um and
 
04:05:18.389 --> 04:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that these are
 
04:05:20.670 --> 04:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
some of my questions would be that how
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
is a school um will they know if they
 
04:05:27.149 --> 04:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
meet these um acoustical standards there
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
might be complaints which might lead
 
04:05:31.189 --> 04:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
them to realize that they don't but
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
unless you potentially have like an
 
04:05:34.950 --> 04:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
Acoustics engineer go in and do an
 
04:05:36.990 --> 04:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
assessment of the building buildings
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
won't necessarily know if they meet
 
04:05:41.550 --> 04:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
those standards or not and I'd also just
 
04:05:45.389 --> 04:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
like to say like the to be clear for us
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
building to come up to these acoustic
 
04:05:51.550 --> 04:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
standards not fut I don't see any issues
 
04:05:53.830 --> 04:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
with new construction and new renovation
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
spaces to be able to meet these
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
standards that should be something
 
04:05:59.830 --> 04:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
completely doable and currently
 
04:06:03.469 --> 04:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
required however um my only concern
 
04:06:07.110 --> 04:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
would be how a school would come up to
 
04:06:10.990 --> 04:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
these standards in the next 5 years and
 
04:06:14.510 --> 04:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
keep in mind lots and lots of school
 
04:06:18.550 --> 04:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
buildings have bookcases dividing their
 
04:06:21.710 --> 04:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
classrooms they have partition walls
 
04:06:23.189 --> 04:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
they have temporary walls they have
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
walls that only go partially to the
 
04:06:29.189 --> 04:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
ceiling all of those spaces um won't
 
04:06:32.030 --> 04:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
meet these standards um schools have
 
04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
spaces where they've taken one large
 
04:06:38.469 --> 04:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
room and just uh divided it with all
 
04:06:41.950 --> 04:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
sorts of weird things um to make the
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
space that they need so construction
 
04:06:46.990 --> 04:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
reconstruction I understand how they'll
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
do that I'm just unclear how schools
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
will be doing that um for the for the
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
2023 that doesn't mean that it's not
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
important so I want to be very clear
 
04:07:02.670 --> 04:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
that Acoustics and learning is very
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
important and I would agree with what
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
the um other speakers said that um
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's very important which is why they're
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
in our minimum construction standards I
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
just I'm not sure the covid money um
 
04:07:18.110 --> 04:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
will be able to address that unless
 
04:07:19.750 --> 04:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
schools are already looking at it
 
04:07:22.269 --> 04:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
specifically for their hbac then that
 
04:07:24.790 --> 04:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
might make sense but it's more than just
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
systems for a
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
post and
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.870 --> 04:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
um that's all my comments I looked over
 
04:07:38.630 --> 04:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
my list so I think I covered them and
 
04:07:40.109 --> 04:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions if you
 
04:07:42.189 --> 04:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
have any thank you are there any
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
04:07:47.950 --> 04:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
Department Amy I have one and then I see
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
Dave Runo has one um in the survey that
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
you have conducted in the past for our
 
04:07:55.790 --> 04:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
schools that we talked about previously
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
before lunch and at other times uh are
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
there any questions on that survey
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
04:08:06.910 --> 04:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
sounds there there are not it's strictly
 
04:08:09.109 --> 04:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
an indoor air
 
04:08:11.950 --> 04:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
survey okay so when you're doing a
 
04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
survey to discern age of our
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
buildings what's in the walls and all
 
04:08:19.070 --> 04:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
that I know in the past we've just had
 
04:08:21.750 --> 04:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
the school custodian or maintenance
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
person or principal do that so there's
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing there in that survey
 
04:08:29.590 --> 04:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with acoustical situations I
 
04:08:33.109 --> 04:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
don't think so I can't see the relation
 
04:08:35.070 --> 04:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a relation between
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
HVAC noise um and but other than that in
 
04:08:40.750 --> 04:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
the indoor air quality survey there is
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
not we have a regular like a volunteer
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
facility survey that we're that we put
 
04:08:47.790 --> 04:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
out uh
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
and um that also I don't think has any
 
04:08:54.030 --> 04:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
um questions about and I have one other
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
followup to that then Dave um talked
 
04:09:00.109 --> 04:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
about oversight and there's basically
 
04:09:02.670 --> 04:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
very little oversight coming from the
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
Department you just don't have the St
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have the engineers to do this
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh is it naturally the responsibility of
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
the state or the local to have this
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
over well I will just say the minimum
 
04:09:16.750 --> 04:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
construction standards are a standard
 
04:09:20.109 --> 04:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
for schools to have to build to uh but
 
04:09:24.149 --> 04:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
with keep in mind so since the 1940s the
 
04:09:25.790 --> 04:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
building Aid has been available to
 
04:09:27.469 --> 04:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
schools for construction and the state
 
04:09:29.389 --> 04:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
reviewed all of those construction
 
04:09:30.670 --> 04:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
projects because they always went
 
04:09:32.349 --> 04:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Education
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
because they were funded based on need
 
04:09:37.750 --> 04:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
of schools but since 2010 building a has
 
04:09:39.469 --> 04:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
not been funded therefore those projects
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
have not gone through our office but
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
that didn't make the minimum
 
04:09:45.510 --> 04:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
construction standards go away so um but
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement for schools to
 
04:09:50.429 --> 04:09:50.439 align:start position:0%
report or have sign offs or they're just
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
standards they have to me kind of you
 
04:09:55.149 --> 04:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
know if anything potentially the local
 
04:09:58.950 --> 04:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
building um code officer might might
 
04:10:00.990 --> 04:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
look at acustic standards but I imagine
 
04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
that that depends on each Town um and I
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I wouldn't bu bet on that I
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
think that they probably mostly building
 
04:10:09.630 --> 04:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
code and fire
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
code thank you very
 
04:10:14.670 --> 04:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much Mr chair and
 
04:10:16.510 --> 04:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again Miss Clark for
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
joining us this afternoon for um uh for
 
04:10:21.389 --> 04:10:21.399 align:start position:0%
the buildings that were um that were
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
constructed prior to the um the acoustic
 
04:10:27.229 --> 04:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
standards you know laid out in the ansy
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
um um standard are there um is there
 
04:10:34.429 --> 04:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
potential I guess for Adaptive
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
Technologies such as um uh F audio
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
transmission um systems that I think are
 
04:10:43.590 --> 04:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
used in a lot of public schools uh
 
04:10:46.910 --> 04:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
around the state um that um that would
 
04:10:51.149 --> 04:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
be able toh to improve the um uh the
 
04:10:53.229 --> 04:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
ability for for students that you know
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
with hearing loss to um to to hear
 
04:10:58.309 --> 04:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
what's going on from the teacher but
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
also improve I guess the the experience
 
04:11:04.109 --> 04:11:04.119 align:start position:0%
for other students as well and also and
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
also the experience of the um instructor
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question I believe
 
04:11:12.389 --> 04:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
since it's outside of like building
 
04:11:15.030 --> 04:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
construction um I'm not fully sure but I
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
believe Ada Federal um there's Federal
 
04:11:20.349 --> 04:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
ADA requirements that require schools to
 
04:11:22.830 --> 04:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
have so many um devices for students to
 
04:11:26.349 --> 04:11:26.359 align:start position:0%
help with hearing um but but I'm not
 
04:11:28.269 --> 04:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
positive on
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
that I believe the FM transmission that
 
04:11:33.389 --> 04:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
many of the teachers have around their
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
waist and they transmit to the child in
 
04:11:39.550 --> 04:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
the classroom that is done through Ida
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's a special ed uh supported item
 
04:11:45.109 --> 04:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
actually Mr
 
04:11:48.750 --> 04:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
chair yeah the um um many districts I
 
04:11:51.309 --> 04:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
know we do it here in hopkington have
 
04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
retrofitted classrooms um with these
 
04:11:58.189 --> 04:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
systems and the um the speaker is not
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
does not reside with the student it's
 
04:12:02.349 --> 04:12:02.359 align:start position:0%
actually built into the walls of the
 
04:12:05.070 --> 04:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
classroom and um and if you haven't for
 
04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
for anybody that that has experien
 
04:12:09.670 --> 04:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
the difference between a classroom
 
04:12:12.349 --> 04:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
without this and a classroom with this I
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
would really encourage um visiting a
 
04:12:16.429 --> 04:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
local school or inquiring with the local
 
04:12:17.950 --> 04:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
school because it's really very
 
04:12:19.950 --> 04:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
impressive technology yeah that
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
technology is much different than we
 
04:12:26.189 --> 04:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
used to do it and and then doing what
 
04:12:28.429 --> 04:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
you're saying Dave is is yeah more
 
04:12:32.229 --> 04:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
expensive but it's 100% better so are
 
04:12:36.349 --> 04:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
there any other questions um well um
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay who's next on
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
here we have Linda Taylor with her hand
 
04:12:43.070 --> 04:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
raised again she's that presented
 
04:12:45.790 --> 04:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
before uh and then we have a new person
 
04:12:48.750 --> 04:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
Gary Abbott with AGC AGC of New
 
04:12:51.469 --> 04:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um they are not scheduled to
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
speak but I will put hasn't spoken okay
 
04:12:55.680 --> 04:12:58.229 align:start position:0%
speak but I will put hasn't spoken okay
first

04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:13:04.189 --> 04:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
Abbott thank you uh chairman lad again
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
for the record my name's Gary Abbott I'm
 
04:13:12.309 --> 04:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
the Executive Vice President of the
 
04:13:14.429 --> 04:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of New
 
04:13:17.429 --> 04:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I like Amy signed up too
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
late on the website and uh uh I want to
 
04:13:24.309 --> 04:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
talk about this bill as I had presented
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
it to
 
04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
contractors uh the first point is where
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
this is located in the statute um if you
 
04:13:36.550 --> 04:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
look at section 199 colon one it really
 
04:13:39.750 --> 04:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
is about location and buildings not
 
04:13:42.870 --> 04:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
building requirements as far as codes
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
for construction it sets up a new
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
chapter we think it's not in the right
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
place when you look at the state has its
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
own building
 
04:13:54.910 --> 04:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
codes and we also have a building code
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
review board that handles amendments to
 
04:14:01.149 --> 04:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
the code so we're not we we're not in
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
favor of the legislature adding sections
 
04:14:07.269 --> 04:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
of code throughout the statutes uh this
 
04:14:10.590 --> 04:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
will be confusing hard to find it won't
 
04:14:12.109 --> 04:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
help with new
 
04:14:14.670 --> 04:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
construction that's why the legislature
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
put together the New Hampshire uh
 
04:14:19.590 --> 04:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
building code review board which through
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
the department of
 
04:14:25.109 --> 04:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
safety so the code when it comes to ansy
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
codes and those they're updated with the
 
04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
different versions of codes as they go
 
04:14:32.590 --> 04:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
through and the legislature just
 
04:14:34.830 --> 04:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
recently passed the legislation that
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
they would keep the codes one code back
 
04:14:39.790 --> 04:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
and keep them updated so they would keep
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
up with the changing
 
04:14:44.109 --> 04:14:44.119 align:start position:0%
regulations so we looked at this
 
04:14:44.119 --> 04:14:45.469 align:start position:0%
regulations so we looked at this
strictly

04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
strictly
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
as not the right place uh if you want to
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
talk about acoustic tiles that kind of
 
04:14:54.429 --> 04:14:54.439 align:start position:0%
thing for classrooms if there needs to
 
04:14:56.109 --> 04:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
be an amendment it needs to go through
 
04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire building code uh
 
04:15:00.469 --> 04:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
review board that's where all the
 
04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
amendments to different codes get placed
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
therefore the industry knows where to go
 
04:15:07.950 --> 04:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
Architects know where to go to look at
 
04:15:10.710 --> 04:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
any individual amendments so I'm not
 
04:15:13.670 --> 04:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
here to talk about the need of the sound
 
04:15:15.870 --> 04:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
quality in the classroom but I'm really
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
here to talk about the construction
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
regulation itself and the major point
 
04:15:24.189 --> 04:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
for us is we are working really hard
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
with communities and municipalities that
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
have additional amendments to all be in
 
04:15:31.990 --> 04:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
one place at the building code review
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
board so we're working on that
 
04:15:36.950 --> 04:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
diligently with the legislature with the
 
04:15:39.109 --> 04:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
building code Review Board in an effort
 
04:15:41.429 --> 04:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
to do that now I represent commercial
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
contractors who build schools and so
 
04:15:47.149 --> 04:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
that was our first when we looked at
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
this we think any amendment should go
 
04:15:51.670 --> 04:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
through the building code review board
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
the second point is uh contractors
 
04:15:58.189 --> 04:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
designers uh Architects they build based
 
04:16:00.269 --> 04:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
on the current code uh the state
 
04:16:02.229 --> 04:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
building code is the minimum code but
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
they can go above and beyond and the
 
04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
towns can require above and beyond for
 
04:16:08.910 --> 04:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
any of their schools for any uh
 
04:16:11.309 --> 04:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
specialty items that they
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
want the the issue is there's a long
 
04:16:17.910 --> 04:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
history of uh you know when we build a
 
04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
school it's kind of it's grandfathered
 
04:16:23.550 --> 04:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
to that date this legislation brings in
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
a standard that you've got to update all
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
the schools now HVAC systems can be very
 
04:16:34.149 --> 04:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
expensive I'm sure my HVAC guys would
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
love to have to renovate all the schools
 
04:16:39.550 --> 04:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
with new HVAC systems but I want to
 
04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
point out that that could be a
 
04:16:44.830 --> 04:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
problematic area and I don't know to
 
04:16:47.469 --> 04:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
what fiscal impact that would have on
 
04:16:49.750 --> 04:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
cities and towns so I want to bring that
 
04:16:52.030 --> 04:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
to your attention and the other
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
compliance there is a Roman 4 that talks
 
04:16:57.990 --> 04:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill about compliance uh in
 
04:17:00.910 --> 04:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
writing with a lead architect usually
 
04:17:04.349 --> 04:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
plans are done um the scope of larger
 
04:17:06.030 --> 04:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
commercial projects are looked at even
 
04:17:07.550 --> 04:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
through the fire mark Marshall's office
 
04:17:09.950 --> 04:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
and others for Code Compliance but the
 
04:17:12.750 --> 04:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
lead architect is designing it to that
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
current standard so it should be in
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
compliance with what is built but I
 
04:17:19.830 --> 04:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
think you're going to end up with some
 
04:17:22.710 --> 04:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
problems with if you're going to try to
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
update some of these older schools this
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
bill could become problematic so I'm not
 
04:17:30.510 --> 04:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to it I just think the venue may
 
04:17:33.950 --> 04:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
be the wrong place for this construction
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
kind of codes issue and with that I
 
04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
would end my testimony and answer any
 
04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
questions of the committee thank you Mr
 
04:17:45.309 --> 04:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
EV uh I do have a question for you um I
 
04:17:48.070 --> 04:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
know that uh schools are annually
 
04:17:51.550 --> 04:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
annually visited by the fire marshal or
 
04:17:54.149 --> 04:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
the the local fire chief that might have
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
that assigned Duty um when they're
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
looking at in terms of fire codes and
 
04:17:59.399 --> 04:18:00.510 align:start position:0%
looking at in terms of fire codes and
building

04:18:00.510 --> 04:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
codes are is there anything dealing with
 
04:18:06.389 --> 04:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
Acoustics that they look at as far as
 
04:18:08.590 --> 04:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
that the building code review board has
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
approved and it's in code now um do we
 
04:18:12.750 --> 04:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
have anything there and who has
 
04:18:15.630 --> 04:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
oversight of that yeah I'm not so sure
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
the fire code looks at that unless it
 
04:18:19.710 --> 04:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
had something to do with you know the
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
fire retardant of the acoustic panel
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
outside of that I think those reviews
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
are for safety purposes of exits and
 
04:18:30.550 --> 04:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
entrances uh those kind of reviews I
 
04:18:32.750 --> 04:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
think this gets into there's an awful
 
04:18:34.830 --> 04:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
lot in the building codes acoustic
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
panels are one piece but there's an
 
04:18:40.229 --> 04:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
awful lot of components um but you know
 
04:18:43.189 --> 04:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
I I'm not in any way saying that there
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be some way for people to look
 
04:18:47.550 --> 04:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
at it and maybe you're only talking one
 
04:18:50.670 --> 04:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
or two classes in a school building uh I
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
just don't know the scope but when you
 
04:18:55.229 --> 04:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
read this the bill really doesn't
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
clarify uh whether the renovation has to
 
04:19:01.630 --> 04:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
be the total HVAC system or whether it's
 
04:19:04.750 --> 04:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
a just classroom by
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
classroom thank you are there any
 
04:19:07.800 --> 04:19:10.590 align:start position:0%
classroom thank you are there any
further

04:19:10.590 --> 04:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:13.870 --> 04:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
questions not see any hands thank you
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
much no I don't oh uh Linda
 
04:19:25.389 --> 04:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
Taylor okay I just didn't know we have a
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
few more movs left in this hearing so
 
04:19:30.830 --> 04:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
one more that's even the second
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
round well she she took her hand down
 
04:19:35.349 --> 04:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm not sure if she had anything
 
04:19:37.710 --> 04:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
else to say don't have anybody else in
 
04:19:41.550 --> 04:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
the queue here so um what do we have in
 
04:19:45.630 --> 04:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
terms of folks okay so uh I am assuming
 
04:19:48.670 --> 04:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
that uh Mr Abbott was
 
04:19:48.680 --> 04:19:50.910 align:start position:0%
that uh Mr Abbott was
opposed

04:19:50.910 --> 04:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
04:19:53.349 --> 04:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
um did he say not
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
opposed neutral okay so we have 15 in
 
04:20:02.830 --> 04:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
support 15 support one oppos one oppos
 
04:20:07.030 --> 04:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
two neutral two neutral and uh I think
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
we had five testified Barbara rep Shaw
 
04:20:13.109 --> 04:20:13.119 align:start position:0%
is that correct four four so we have
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
four testified thank you
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
very I'm an off
 
04:20:18.720 --> 04:20:21.710 align:start position:0%
very I'm an off
day

04:20:21.710 --> 04:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:20:23.870 --> 04:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay with that we're gonna close
 
04:20:27.469 --> 04:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
down to HB 267 and we will start the
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
next one in about seven minutes or
 
04:20:34.349 --> 04:20:34.359 align:start position:0%
so give the tech person a chance for
 
04:20:34.359 --> 04:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
so give the tech person a chance for
some

04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:20:35.520 --> 04:21:05.429 align:start position:0%
some
coffee

04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:27:34.910 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.920 --> 04:27:37.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:27:37.389 --> 04:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:27:40.030 --> 04:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay we're going to go ahead now it

is 1:30 and we're ready to go ahead with
 
04:27:46.910 --> 04:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
the next bill which is HB 441 requiring
 
04:27:49.590 --> 04:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
Universal Declaration of Human Rights to
 
04:27:52.109 --> 04:27:52.119 align:start position:0%
be placed in all public
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
schools the prime sponsor of that bill
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%

04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
hi there
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
hello welcome to
 
04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
education thank you very much am am I
 
04:28:14.560 --> 04:28:16.349 align:start position:0%
education thank you very much am am I
recognized

04:28:16.349 --> 04:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
04:28:20.870 --> 04:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
or go ahead thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:28:22.830 --> 04:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
and honorable members of the education
 
04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
04:28:27.309 --> 04:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham 17 the
 
04:28:30.710 --> 04:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
towns of New Market and new Fields um
 
04:28:33.389 --> 04:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
and the bill I have here today for you
 
04:28:35.229 --> 04:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
uh pretty simple one is the posting of
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
the UN Declaration of Human Rights in
 
04:28:40.469 --> 04:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
schools um this is a bill that was
 
04:28:42.670 --> 04:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
brought to me by another representative
 
04:28:46.950 --> 04:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
who is a cross the a from me uh he the
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
idea was brought to him by one of his
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
constituents and um while at the time he
 
04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
was not opposed to the idea I don't
 
04:28:57.309 --> 04:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
think it was the kind of thing that he
 
04:29:01.229 --> 04:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
saw as being um uh something that people
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
would expect him to put in so he asked
 
04:29:06.229 --> 04:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
if I would put this in for him and I
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
said yes um and so and I spoke with this
 
04:29:12.990 --> 04:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
constituent of his and the idea here
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
just for some background the United
 
04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
Nations Declaration on human rights was
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
um formed in the wake of World War II
 
04:29:23.750 --> 04:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
after the atrocities that the world had
 
04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
experienced and it was the first time
 
04:29:30.189 --> 04:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
this is in 1948 the first time ever that
 
04:29:33.790 --> 04:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh the world um or even any substantial
 
04:29:36.070 --> 04:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
amount of the world had put forth for
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
the idea that all human beings had a
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
standard by which that they should be
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
treated um and so when I spoke with this
 
04:29:48.830 --> 04:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
constituent uh about why we should have
 
04:29:52.870 --> 04:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
this posted in schools the idea was that
 
04:29:54.990 --> 04:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
um this constituent certainly not him
 
04:29:58.030 --> 04:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
only but I think many of us are dismayed
 
04:30:00.550 --> 04:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
at the level of polarization and the
 
04:30:04.429 --> 04:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
lack of Civility that has um kind of
 
04:30:07.710 --> 04:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
beleaguered our our our culture these
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
recent years and um the thought was and
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
and I I connected with this particular
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
constituent because I actually teach
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
American government in college and first
 
04:30:21.309 --> 04:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
day every semester I teach my students
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
the factors uh that lend stability
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
conditions for a stable democracy and
 
04:30:28.469 --> 04:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
one of those factors is what we call
 
04:30:31.550 --> 04:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
social cohesion and social cohesion is
 
04:30:35.790 --> 04:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
the idea that we are more invested in
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
each other as members of our community
 
04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
as fellow human beings than we are as
 
04:30:45.389 --> 04:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
political Rivals so if I for example we
 
04:30:48.030 --> 04:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
both go to the same like archery club or
 
04:30:50.750 --> 04:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
we share you know we go to the same
 
04:30:53.469 --> 04:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
church or whatever then I'm more
 
04:30:55.990 --> 04:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
invested in you and can see you as
 
04:30:58.870 --> 04:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
something that is kind of similar to me
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
and uh recognize that you have inherent
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
um worth and the the the right to be
 
04:31:10.309 --> 04:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
respected just like I want to be and
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
because of that I am more invested in
 
04:31:15.070 --> 04:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
you um than I am and you as a political
 
04:31:16.990 --> 04:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
rival and so I'm invested in getting in
 
04:31:21.269 --> 04:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
in moving past our differences um so the
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
idea of kind of teaching children at an
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
early stage that we all have these basic
 
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
human rights this is something that the
 
04:31:32.429 --> 04:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
world has actually decided upon long ago
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
because of how poorly we have all
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
treated each other in the past past in
 
04:31:38.830 --> 04:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
history um was something that really
 
04:31:41.189 --> 04:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
spoke to me because this actually helps
 
04:31:43.750 --> 04:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
us create stable
 
04:31:46.070 --> 04:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
democracies so um and I believe that
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
that particular constituent is here to
 
04:31:50.309 --> 04:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
talk more about um his feelings on the
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
matter um so I'll just I I'll put that
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
out there I won't read there's a it's a
 
04:31:57.349 --> 04:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
list the actual declaration is a list of
 
04:31:59.950 --> 04:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
30 articles it can be printed on one
 
04:32:03.109 --> 04:32:03.119 align:start position:0%
large piece of paper um it's frequently
 
04:32:07.149 --> 04:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
put on posters but each article is about
 
04:32:10.950 --> 04:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh one or two sentences so it's not very
 
04:32:12.950 --> 04:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
large or prohibitively large to to post
 
04:32:16.109 --> 04:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
on one sheet of paper um there is a
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
obviously a cost a DI Minimus cost to
 
04:32:22.229 --> 04:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
putting up a piece of paper in every
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
school um I I dare say that I could
 
04:32:27.389 --> 04:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
probably pay for it out of my own pocket
 
04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
which is actually really saying
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
something considering I'm just an
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
adjunct at a community college so um the
 
04:32:37.389 --> 04:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
uh the member across the aisle from me
 
04:32:39.750 --> 04:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
had offered the notion that perhaps it
 
04:32:42.269 --> 04:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
could be amended to include the United
 
04:32:44.469 --> 04:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
States Constitution and Declaration of
 
04:32:47.429 --> 04:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
Independence um and I'm perfectly amable
 
04:32:48.830 --> 04:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
with that these are things I obviously
 
04:32:52.550 --> 04:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
Teach as well and then I'll just uh
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
close by saying that any time in
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
politics that we these days I guess that
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
we talk about anything related to the
 
04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
United Nations I kind of feel like I
 
04:33:06.150 --> 04:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
have to address something of an elephant
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
in the room which is the idea of the and
 
04:33:10.390 --> 04:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
many of you might be familiar with the
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
agenda 21 conspiracy theory um that the
 
04:33:17.070 --> 04:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
UN is I I don't want to get into into it
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
but there's like things about Illuminati
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
and taking over the world and and all of
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
those things and I just want to put that
 
04:33:24.830 --> 04:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
out there that I was contacted by some
 
04:33:27.750 --> 04:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
people who were very concerned that
 
04:33:29.789 --> 04:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
something from the UN would be put into
 
04:33:32.990 --> 04:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
our schools um because they were I guess
 
04:33:35.629 --> 04:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
you know bought into some of these ideas
 
04:33:38.189 --> 04:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
um by the way that theory has been
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
routin roundly uh debunked over and over
 
04:33:44.830 --> 04:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
again but um I will say that the one
 
04:33:47.470 --> 04:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
article that was pointed to me out to me
 
04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
as problematic to the to these
 
04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
individuals who are concerned about uh
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
the so-called Agenda 21 um was Article
 
04:33:58.029 --> 04:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
29 where and I didn't read all of the
 
04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful articles and I'll just pull
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
this up real fast so I can read it to
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
you article
 
04:34:04.279 --> 04:34:07.269 align:start position:0%
you article
29

04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
29
 
04:34:10.429 --> 04:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
states that nothing
 
04:34:15.590 --> 04:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:20.349 --> 04:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh sorry I lost my
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
place nothing uh no right these rights
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
and freedoms May in no case be exercised
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
contrary to the purposes and principles
 
04:34:28.869 --> 04:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
of the United Nation United Nations this
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
was something that was of concern to the
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
person that I spoke with I did look into
 
04:34:36.269 --> 04:34:36.279 align:start position:0%
what the purposes and principles of the
 
04:34:38.949 --> 04:34:38.959 align:start position:0%
United Nations were um the four main
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
purposes of the UN is to keep peace
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the world to develop business
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
from the UN website to develop friendly
 
04:34:46.949 --> 04:34:46.959 align:start position:0%
relations among nations to help Nations
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
work together to improve the lives of
 
04:34:50.189 --> 04:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
poor people to conquer hunger disease
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
and illiteracy and to encourage respect
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
for each other's rights and freedoms and
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
to be a center for harmonizing the
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
actions of Nations to achieve these
 
04:35:01.470 --> 04:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
goals uh the principles include and
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
there's you know a longer document but
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
equality the self-determination of
 
04:35:04.879 --> 04:35:05.709 align:start position:0%
equality the self-determination of
Nations

04:35:05.709 --> 04:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
Nations
 
04:35:07.590 --> 04:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
respect of Human Rights and fundamental
 
04:35:09.830 --> 04:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
freedoms and the use of peaceful means
 
04:35:13.269 --> 04:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
to resolve conflict so I just I I would
 
04:35:16.070 --> 04:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
say that it is fine to say that none of
 
04:35:17.910 --> 04:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
that should be interpreted to be in
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
contrary to those purposes um but I did
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
want to go ahead and and and kind of run
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
out in front of the um Agenda 21 style
 
04:35:28.349 --> 04:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
arguments and with that I'm I'm happy to
 
04:35:28.359 --> 04:35:29.189 align:start position:0%
arguments and with that I'm I'm happy to
take

04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
04:35:34.750 --> 04:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative Reed uh representa M
 
04:35:37.189 --> 04:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you repr Reed
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
for uh your measure I want to just
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
applaud your Civic activism and the
 
04:35:44.709 --> 04:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
intent of the measure uh my one quick
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
question article three states quote
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
unquote everyone has the right to life
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
which I I have no problem with that uh
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
but do you think that could be problem
 
04:35:56.910 --> 04:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
others it could be problematic for
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
others uh what would you say to that
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
well um I would say that our very
 
04:36:06.189 --> 04:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
Declaration of indep dependence and
 
04:36:08.670 --> 04:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
writings before that say that we have a
 
04:36:13.150 --> 04:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
right to life so I presume and please do
 
04:36:15.150 --> 04:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
interrupt me if I'm speaking out of turn
 
04:36:17.551 --> 04:36:17.561 align:start position:0%
I presume you might be um
 
04:36:20.429 --> 04:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
referencing uh the debate between
 
04:36:25.510 --> 04:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
pro-choice and pro-life um arguments and
 
04:36:27.709 --> 04:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
I from what I understand of that debate
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
that debate centers heavily around at
 
04:36:32.429 --> 04:36:32.439 align:start position:0%
what stage of fetus is considered a
 
04:36:35.629 --> 04:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
human person and so whatever that stage
 
04:36:38.070 --> 04:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
is whatever people decide that is at
 
04:36:40.869 --> 04:36:40.879 align:start position:0%
that point we all agree that a person
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
has a right to life so um I don't see a
 
04:36:46.830 --> 04:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
problem with stating as we always have
 
04:36:48.750 --> 04:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
in this country that we have a right to
 
04:36:51.869 --> 04:36:51.879 align:start position:0%
life liberty and uh we say the pursuit
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
of happiness but uh Security in one's
 
04:36:57.230 --> 04:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
person is is how the UN puts
 
04:37:00.750 --> 04:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
it thank you thank you very much further
 
04:37:03.910 --> 04:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
questions represent cordelli thank you
 
04:37:05.310 --> 04:37:05.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank thank you
 
04:37:07.310 --> 04:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative for being here this
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon um I'm just wondering
 
04:37:15.310 --> 04:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
um with this declaration is there any um
 
04:37:17.949 --> 04:37:17.959 align:start position:0%
enforcement or there are several places
 
04:37:21.670 --> 04:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
that refer to laws whose laws are we
 
04:37:25.869 --> 04:37:25.879 align:start position:0%
talking about um and for instance also
 
04:37:29.551 --> 04:37:29.561 align:start position:0%
mentioned article nine No One S shall be
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
subjected to arbitrary arrest who
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:41.551 --> 04:37:41.561 align:start position:0%
res thank you for the question um so
 
04:37:45.470 --> 04:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
from my reading of this the UN as I just
 
04:37:47.429 --> 04:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
said in its principles believes in the
 
04:37:49.470 --> 04:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
serey of Nations and one of in one of
 
04:37:51.949 --> 04:37:51.959 align:start position:0%
those principles also talks about the
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
non-interference with domestic matters
 
04:37:59.709 --> 04:37:59.719 align:start position:0%
so um what I'm curious as to what part
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
you're talking about when it talks about
 
04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
laws but um what I believe the overall
 
04:38:07.590 --> 04:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
intention is saying is that laws should
 
04:38:11.070 --> 04:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
not be written to uh take these human
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
rights away from people but beyond that
 
04:38:17.109 --> 04:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
they don't interfere with with laws in
 
04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
terms of the UN itself as a
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
charter member nations you know join the
 
04:38:27.510 --> 04:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
UN and then are you know held to the the
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
charter principles so um there is the
 
04:38:33.990 --> 04:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
concept of uh making sure that member
 
04:38:36.510 --> 04:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
nations are accountable to that Charter
 
04:38:39.470 --> 04:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
but um that's not really a law and as
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
far as arbitrary arrest um I mean you
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
could say this about so many of
 
04:38:45.869 --> 04:38:45.879 align:start position:0%
basically everything that's written
 
04:38:47.390 --> 04:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
whenever you're guaranteeing any kind of
 
04:38:49.470 --> 04:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
right or anything like that there's a
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
lot of room for
 
04:38:53.109 --> 04:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
interpretation but we all understand
 
04:38:56.629 --> 04:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
arbitrary arrest is when um there was no
 
04:38:59.551 --> 04:38:59.561 align:start position:0%
good reason to detain someone uh
 
04:39:02.629 --> 04:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
possibly for example in a a a political
 
04:39:04.029 --> 04:39:04.039 align:start position:0%
conflict where somebody might be
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
arresting their political opponents or
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
something like that but the idea is that
 
04:39:10.990 --> 04:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
if someone gets um detained that there
 
04:39:13.709 --> 04:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
is a good reason behind that um
 
04:39:15.750 --> 04:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion that they committed
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
a crime or or what have you so I think
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
we can all agree I'm gonna go on a limb
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
and say I hope we can all agree that um
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
arbitrary arrest however you might
 
04:39:27.310 --> 04:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
Define arbitrary but it certainly if
 
04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
it's arbitrary that we should not be
 
04:39:29.240 --> 04:39:31.670 align:start position:0%
it's arbitrary that we should not be
tolerating

04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
tolerating
 
04:39:33.949 --> 04:39:33.959 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:39:36.550 --> 04:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
taking the question article
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
22 we have the right to affordable
 
04:39:41.310 --> 04:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
housing medicine education and child
 
04:39:44.708 --> 04:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
care enough money to live on and medical
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
health AR we now getting into socialism
 
04:39:47.878 --> 04:39:49.510 align:start position:0%
health AR we now getting into socialism
and

04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:52.868 --> 04:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
communism well I mean it when you talk
 
04:39:56.190 --> 04:39:56.200 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna really try to hold back my
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
desire to to hop into my uh my teacher
 
04:40:01.990 --> 04:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
mode about the difference between
 
04:40:03.788 --> 04:40:03.798 align:start position:0%
communism and socialism these are
 
04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
economic systems political systems and
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know communism is a very extreme but
 
04:40:11.470 --> 04:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
you know it's never actually functioned
 
04:40:14.030 --> 04:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
in the world socialism is a huge you
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
know big giant grayscale of diff many
 
04:40:19.510 --> 04:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
many many different flavors and many of
 
04:40:22.190 --> 04:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
those do exist in the world um but in
 
04:40:24.270 --> 04:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the right so saying that
 
04:40:26.270 --> 04:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
someone has a right or that you know
 
04:40:30.310 --> 04:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
everyone should have XYZ is one thing
 
04:40:32.470 --> 04:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
socialism as you might point out or any
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
other economic system whereby you try to
 
04:40:37.230 --> 04:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
attempt to get there is is just what you
 
04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
choose to get there right so if you can
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
form for example a capitalist structure
 
04:40:45.510 --> 04:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
that ensures that everyone has basic uh
 
04:40:48.190 --> 04:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
needs like you mentioned um then then
 
04:40:50.070 --> 04:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
that would be fine too so saying that
 
04:40:52.030 --> 04:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
everyone needs these things is different
 
04:40:53.670 --> 04:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
from saying how do you go about
 
04:40:55.788 --> 04:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
providing those things and that's up to
 
04:40:58.788 --> 04:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
each Nation to
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
decide thank you very much uh represent
 
04:41:05.470 --> 04:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
wood thank you Mr chairman represent
 
04:41:08.590 --> 04:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I
 
04:41:10.788 --> 04:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
was interested to read over this
 
04:41:13.590 --> 04:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
document in preparation for this hearing
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
and of course is 1949 it says I think
 
04:41:20.868 --> 04:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
1833 words so looking at the looking at
 
04:41:20.878 --> 04:41:22.230 align:start position:0%
1833 words so looking at the looking at
the

04:41:22.230 --> 04:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:41:24.830 --> 04:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
U legislation that talked about from
 
04:41:26.788 --> 04:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
grades K to
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
12 uh I'm not sure the value of having
 
04:41:33.270 --> 04:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
that particular document uh in grades K
 
04:41:36.910 --> 04:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
through 12 uh as an entity however I did
 
04:41:38.590 --> 04:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to look at many
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
adapted ones for grade level pieces
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
which make much more sense and I was
 
04:41:46.350 --> 04:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the as representative B just
 
04:41:46.360 --> 04:41:47.430 align:start position:0%
looking at the as representative B just
talked

04:41:47.430 --> 04:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
talked
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
they his grade level one would be they
 
04:41:52.830 --> 04:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
have it one phrase we all have a right
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
to affordable housing medicine education
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
child care enough M to live on in
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
medical health depending on the age of
 
04:42:00.390 --> 04:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
the youngster in school so my question
 
04:42:03.788 --> 04:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
is is the intent of this uh declaration
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
if approved to be grade level
 
04:42:09.470 --> 04:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate versus or as your thinking
 
04:42:11.788 --> 04:42:11.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to take that 1949 document
 
04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
of 833 words and just plaster it on a
 
04:42:17.230 --> 04:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
wall thank you very much for the
 
04:42:18.670 --> 04:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
question and you are correct this has
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
been um adapted to all sorts of you know
 
04:42:26.350 --> 04:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
child level reading um book form and you
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
name it
 
04:42:31.390 --> 04:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
cartoons uh so certainly my intention it
 
04:42:33.390 --> 04:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
would be completely in keeping with my
 
04:42:35.550 --> 04:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
intention to post it in a Grade
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate format um like I said the
 
04:42:39.910 --> 04:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative who approached me with
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
this was also talking about including
 
04:42:43.830 --> 04:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
the Constitution the F the US
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the Declaration of
 
04:42:48.390 --> 04:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
Independence and I don't think we've
 
04:42:50.110 --> 04:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
adapted those the same way this has been
 
04:42:52.350 --> 04:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
adapted to a child level reading good
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
point but good point right so if we were
 
04:42:57.110 --> 04:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna say let's put that out
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
there and and have it as like a formal
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
thing that's on the wall then uh you
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
know it makes sense to kind of leave it
 
04:43:04.990 --> 04:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
in if those are in the original form to
 
04:43:06.390 --> 04:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
leave this in its original form but I'm
 
04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
not at all married to that and I think
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
it's totally fine to just convey the
 
04:43:12.990 --> 04:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
meaning um to Children sure thank you
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
very much representative thank you Mr
 
04:43:16.868 --> 04:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
chairman welcome are there any other
 
04:43:18.990 --> 04:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
04:43:21.750 --> 04:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative representative Mo thank
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you uh represent for
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um personally I I uh
 
04:43:30.868 --> 04:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
I see value to this at least in terms of
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
it being a educational historical
 
04:43:37.470 --> 04:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
document um just speaking for myself so
 
04:43:40.430 --> 04:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'm ask I'm wondering would you see a
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
possibility of this being amended so
 
04:43:44.190 --> 04:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
that it would be in every school as
 
04:43:46.590 --> 04:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to every classroom especially if
 
04:43:49.390 --> 04:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
you might be paying for it if I
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
personally am uh so uh absolutely every
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
school is fine I think I thought that
 
04:43:57.430 --> 04:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
the language said every school and
 
04:43:59.430 --> 04:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
Civics Civic specifically Civics
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
classroom which would only be High
 
04:44:03.868 --> 04:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
School uh or possibly mid Middle School
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh like so like one extra classroom in
 
04:44:08.110 --> 04:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
high schools and middle schools uh but
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
yeah if it's just every school that is
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:19.150 --> 04:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
intent thank you very thank you uh not
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
see any other other hands up right now
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative and
 
04:44:25.750 --> 04:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the next person who is okay
 
04:44:28.110 --> 04:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
next speaker is anarie Banfield she's
 
04:44:30.948 --> 04:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
been promoted uh go ahead
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
please okay thank you um my name is Anar
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
bfield and I'm an advocate for parental
 
04:44:38.190 --> 04:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
rights and academic excellence and
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
education today I come here in strong
 
04:44:42.990 --> 04:44:43.000 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
441 uh first of all there's nothing
 
04:44:48.270 --> 04:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
prohibiting a teacher or principal from
 
04:44:49.990 --> 04:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
placing this document or any other
 
04:44:51.868 --> 04:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
document in their school why does this
 
04:44:54.310 --> 04:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
have to be a law and since there is no
 
04:44:55.948 --> 04:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
mandate that the United States
 
04:44:57.628 --> 04:44:57.638 align:start position:0%
Constitution be placed in all public
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
schools this certainly gives the
 
04:45:01.750 --> 04:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
impression that the UN document is being
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
elevated the Declaration of Human Rights
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
is considered a common standard of
 
04:45:07.990 --> 04:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
achievements for All Peoples and All
 
04:45:10.110 --> 04:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
Nations but within their this document
 
04:45:12.510 --> 04:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
there are goals that are Troublesome and
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
even by definition
 
04:45:19.868 --> 04:45:19.878 align:start position:0%
tyrannical So within article 26 it says
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
Elementary education shall be
 
04:45:25.030 --> 04:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
compulsory there is nothing in that
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
article that makes an exception for
 
04:45:30.430 --> 04:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
homeschooling there's also a debate on
 
04:45:32.708 --> 04:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
whether compulsory education is good
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
policy the US Supreme Court recognizes
 
04:45:37.190 --> 04:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
that parents have the fundamental
 
04:45:40.030 --> 04:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental Liber liberty interest for
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
the education of their children prior to
 
04:45:45.190 --> 04:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
com compulsory education parents and
 
04:45:46.750 --> 04:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
teachers worked together there was less
 
04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy less red tape less Data
 
04:45:51.070 --> 04:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
Tracking Beyond achievement much less
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
testing and more opportunity for an
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
education tailored to the child's needs
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
it's really up to the residents of New
 
04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to determine support or
 
04:46:03.150 --> 04:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to this type of education I
 
04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
do have a major issue with article 29
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
where it states literally under number
 
04:46:12.430 --> 04:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
two under number three these rights that
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
they list and freedoms May in no case be
 
04:46:18.390 --> 04:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
exercised contrary to the purposes and
 
04:46:21.150 --> 04:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
principles of the United Nations that's
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
quite a
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
statement this is in direct contrast to
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
the Declaration of Independence which
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
gave birth to our Republic and set forth
 
04:46:32.510 --> 04:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
our unalienable rights to life liberty
 
04:46:34.910 --> 04:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
and the pursuit of happiness compare
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
article 29 to the adoption of the
 
04:46:38.910 --> 04:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution of the United States which
 
04:46:41.948 --> 04:46:41.958 align:start position:0%
built on the foundation principles set
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
forth in the Declaration of Independence
 
04:46:46.390 --> 04:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
the constitutional republic is a
 
04:46:48.350 --> 04:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
government of the People by the people
 
04:46:51.230 --> 04:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
and for the people we are self-governed
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
and our rights do not come from the
 
04:46:56.788 --> 04:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
United Nations if HB 441 passes what
 
04:46:58.590 --> 04:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
does this say to the students attending
 
04:47:00.548 --> 04:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
Public Schools what does it say to the
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire what does it
 
04:47:05.708 --> 04:47:05.718 align:start position:0%
say to the nation we may find Provisions
 
04:47:08.110 --> 04:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
in this document that have some value
 
04:47:09.990 --> 04:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
teachers are free to use this document
 
04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
within their scope and sequence but if
 
04:47:15.070 --> 04:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
you vote for HB 441 you are saying to
 
04:47:17.230 --> 04:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
everyone that this document is worthy of
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
elevating to the point where we now want
 
04:47:21.948 --> 04:47:21.958 align:start position:0%
this document in all schools I have
 
04:47:24.110 --> 04:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely no problem with my children
 
04:47:26.430 --> 04:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
reading this document but I want it
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
explained in reference to our founding
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
documents and that our individual rights
 
04:47:33.830 --> 04:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
are inalienable not given to us by a
 
04:47:35.510 --> 04:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
glob Global
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
organization this document is certainly
 
04:47:40.190 --> 04:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
worthy of discussion and debate in a
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
civic's classroom however I would not
 
04:47:45.030 --> 04:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
want that discussion led by an educator
 
04:47:46.948 --> 04:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
I would want that discussion led by an
 
04:47:49.548 --> 04:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
educator who understands our system of
 
04:47:52.590 --> 04:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
government a republic that was set up to
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
place power in the hands of the people
 
04:47:57.030 --> 04:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
and not a global organization that they
 
04:47:57.040 --> 04:47:58.670 align:start position:0%
and not a global organization that they
cannot

04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
04:48:01.350 --> 04:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
access so this is not about censoring
 
04:48:03.628 --> 04:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
information this is about State Statute
 
04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
and it elevating a document that with a
 
04:48:09.470 --> 04:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
with with is almost like a direct attack
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
on our Liberty um you know just just
 
04:48:17.310 --> 04:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
listening to you all asked questions of
 
04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and having her discuss and
 
04:48:24.030 --> 04:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
and debate this and and educate and talk
 
04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
about that's good that's great for a
 
04:48:29.788 --> 04:48:29.798 align:start position:0%
classroom and that's what I would want
 
04:48:31.788 --> 04:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's not about hiding this
 
04:48:33.548 --> 04:48:33.558 align:start position:0%
document or being afraid or any kind of
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
conspir iracy it's more about let's make
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
sure that if this document is introduced
 
04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
to children in a school that it's done
 
04:48:44.548 --> 04:48:44.558 align:start position:0%
in an educated way and a way where where
 
04:48:46.150 --> 04:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
we're discussing and debating and
 
04:48:48.470 --> 04:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
talking about and understanding what
 
04:48:51.390 --> 04:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
some of these provisions mean and do is
 
04:48:53.190 --> 04:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
it in contrast to what we have in our
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
own country um just finally a a few
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
other points I wanted to bring up you
 
04:49:01.110 --> 04:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
know I was uh working the polls years
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
ago in Bedford and I was sitting there
 
04:49:05.708 --> 04:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
with two students that were getting
 
04:49:07.750 --> 04:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
ready to graduate from high school and I
 
04:49:09.150 --> 04:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
asked them have you read the United
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
States Constitution before you graduate
 
04:49:13.350 --> 04:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
from high school and their answer was no
 
04:49:19.110 --> 04:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
can we please focus on on you know
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
making sure our kids are getting a
 
04:49:21.000 --> 04:49:21.990 align:start position:0%
making sure our kids are getting a
quality

04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
quality
 
04:49:25.990 --> 04:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
education and and then let's move into
 
04:49:28.750 --> 04:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
things like this uh I just I'm just so
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
afraid that this kind of state law makes
 
04:49:35.230 --> 04:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
a statement and that's what that's what
 
04:49:37.548 --> 04:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
concerns me but I do appre appreciate
 
04:49:39.070 --> 04:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
the discussion I appreciate the
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
questions this is exactly what I would
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
expect in a civics class for my kids and
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
that's why I want it discussed but I
 
04:49:47.230 --> 04:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
don't want I don't believe it needs to
 
04:49:49.470 --> 04:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
be in law so I do thank you for taking
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%

Carl from the school board uh I'm sorry
 
04:50:13.788 --> 04:50:13.798 align:start position:0%
not the School Board Association the
 
04:50:15.708 --> 04:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
school administrators
 
04:50:18.590 --> 04:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
Association go ahead
 
04:50:21.548 --> 04:50:21.558 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon members of uh
 
04:50:24.750 --> 04:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
House Ed um thank you for letting me uh
 
04:50:27.150 --> 04:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
testify this afternoon I find myself in
 
04:50:29.948 --> 04:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
somewhat Uncharted Territory as I'm in
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
agreement with Miss Banfield but for
 
04:50:36.030 --> 04:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
different reasons any SAA opposes uh
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
this legislation we certainly appreciate
 
04:50:41.470 --> 04:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill um but we are
 
04:50:44.670 --> 04:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
opposed uh because it is a requirement
 
04:50:48.670 --> 04:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh with no funding background or purpose
 
04:50:50.708 --> 04:50:50.718 align:start position:0%
uh simply placing something in a school
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily equate uh to
 
04:50:55.948 --> 04:50:55.958 align:start position:0%
meeting the intention of the sponsor and
 
04:50:58.230 --> 04:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
one question I would ask is I wonder if
 
04:51:00.590 --> 04:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass would this be
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
considered a divisive concept under HB
 
04:51:07.948 --> 04:51:07.958 align:start position:0%

04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Reed and I thank her I
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
didn't realize how much of a commotion
 
04:53:13.628 --> 04:53:13.638 align:start position:0%
this might cause uh yeah it's a a bill
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
that U we wanted posted to basically in
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
and I was thinking I was a high school
 
04:53:25.548 --> 04:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
history teacher in some Civics uh trying
 
04:53:30.070 --> 04:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
to uh inform students and I I sent my
 
04:53:31.990 --> 04:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
written testimony I hope you receive
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
that uh I don't want to repeat what I've
 
04:53:37.948 --> 04:53:37.958 align:start position:0%
said but uh to inform to educate and
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
possibly to inspire uh both students
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
teachers administrators parents to delve
 
04:53:45.360 --> 04:53:46.868 align:start position:0%
teachers administrators parents to delve
deeper

04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
deeper
 
04:53:50.948 --> 04:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
into uh our Constitution which I taught
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
and in the latter stages of my career
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
when I received information from Amnesty
 
04:54:01.390 --> 04:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
International actually a film short film
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
that went through all 30 Les of the
 
04:54:07.948 --> 04:54:07.958 align:start position:0%
universal declaration we did compare uh
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights to the uh Universal
 
04:54:14.948 --> 04:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
declaration as a matter of fact I have a
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
copy in front of me I'm going to run
 
04:54:19.270 --> 04:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
through everything but like for example
 
04:54:21.830 --> 04:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
Universal declaration article two
 
04:54:24.390 --> 04:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
relates to the our 14th Amendment
 
04:54:26.670 --> 04:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
Article Five relates to our Eighth
 
04:54:29.310 --> 04:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh article 12 to our fourth
 
04:54:32.868 --> 04:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
amendment on privacy uh article 18 First
 
04:54:36.470 --> 04:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment religion uh so I I understand
 
04:54:39.670 --> 04:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
the concerns of of some of the folks who
 
04:54:42.910 --> 04:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill which I of course do
 
04:54:45.868 --> 04:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
support uh but the the thing to recall
 
04:54:48.670 --> 04:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
also is that the universal Declaration
 
04:54:52.350 --> 04:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
of Human Rights uh which was adopted by
 
04:54:56.230 --> 04:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
the way uh 1948 on December 10th and
 
04:55:01.230 --> 04:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
incidentally the uh the actual uh
 
04:55:04.830 --> 04:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
Charter which was signed in s Francisco
 
04:55:06.470 --> 04:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
on June
 
04:55:10.510 --> 04:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
26 1945 right before the end of World
 
04:55:13.110 --> 04:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
War II actually uh I went to a
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
convention there in that Hall that
 
04:55:17.830 --> 04:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
Auditorium uh where that document was
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
signed so I I have a kind of a close
 
04:55:24.030 --> 04:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
Affinity to that but anyway uh uh
 
04:55:26.030 --> 04:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Reed mentioned the fact
 
04:55:28.750 --> 04:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
that um I think she mentioned the League
 
04:55:32.110 --> 04:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
of Nations was a failure uh the U
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
Holocaust were where uh uh millions of
 
04:55:39.150 --> 04:55:39.160 align:start position:0%
people were were killed including uh you
 
04:55:41.070 --> 04:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
know Gypsies and
 
04:55:45.030 --> 04:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
homosexuals and political dissidents Etc
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
um so they came together in San
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
Francisco in
 
04:55:52.750 --> 04:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
1945 and signed that that initial
 
04:55:56.948 --> 04:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
document and then on December 10th
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
1948 uh the general assembly did
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
announce the vote uh in favor and
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
ification including the United States uh
 
04:56:09.670 --> 04:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
of the universal declaration which most
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
importantly to recall is not a treaty it
 
04:56:17.948 --> 04:56:17.958 align:start position:0%
is not binding on any country uh what is
 
04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
binding however are the Proto the
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
covenants and the conventions and the um
 
04:56:30.230 --> 04:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
the protocols to these conventions and
 
04:56:33.910 --> 04:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
Covenants of the 18 that I know of I've
 
04:56:37.230 --> 04:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
researched the United States has signed
 
04:56:41.430 --> 04:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
and ratified but five uh 13 that we have
 
04:56:42.868 --> 04:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
04:56:48.750 --> 04:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
ratified and so I I I think that maybe
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
they're reading too much into this yeah
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I think age appropriate uh by the
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
way representative Reed if you're
 
04:56:57.628 --> 04:56:57.638 align:start position:0%
listening we would help py my other
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
organization called Veterans for peace
 
04:57:02.788 --> 04:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh we were thinking of laminating them
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and and the fact that they're
 
04:57:09.270 --> 04:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
there may stimulate people act as a
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
catalyst to inquire well what is this
 
04:57:15.270 --> 04:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this uh but yeah in the
 
04:57:17.390 --> 04:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
classroom where it should be taught I
 
04:57:22.708 --> 04:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
think in terms of of what what this
 
04:57:26.230 --> 04:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
country has stood for or says it stands
 
04:57:29.948 --> 04:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
for uh human rights among other things
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
by the way Franklin Roosevelt in January
 
04:57:33.440 --> 04:57:34.350 align:start position:0%
by the way Franklin Roosevelt in January
6

04:57:34.350 --> 04:57:34.360 align:start position:0%
6
 
04:57:36.910 --> 04:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
1941 if you haven't read it I recommend
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
it highly the for freedom
 
04:57:44.350 --> 04:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
speech uh which uh uh president
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
Rosevelt spoke of a
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
unified uh world and a precursor of the
 
04:57:56.190 --> 04:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
United Nations so anyway I would U be
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%

state basically dlan's rule says that
 
05:00:31.990 --> 05:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
unless a political subdivision has been
 
05:00:34.548 --> 05:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
specifically granted The Authority it
 
05:00:36.948 --> 05:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
does not have the authority to
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
act House Bill 69 is enabling
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
legislation it is granting a school the
 
05:00:44.548 --> 05:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
authority to display the national
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
modotto of the United States of America
 
05:00:48.350 --> 05:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
in school
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
buildings if schools if a school does
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
not have the funds to provide the
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
durable poster or frame copy of the
 
05:00:57.708 --> 05:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
national model a school May accept
 
05:01:00.150 --> 05:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
non-public funds or in-kind
 
05:01:02.430 --> 05:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
contributions so that the national model
 
05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
can be displayed in the
 
05:01:06.510 --> 05:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
school in our recent history there have
 
05:01:08.190 --> 05:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
been many attempts to have the national
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
model removed from government buildings
 
05:01:12.430 --> 05:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
and even the US
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
currency in 2018 the 8th Circuit Court
 
05:01:18.430 --> 05:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
ruled that the national modotto on US
 
05:01:21.310 --> 05:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
currency was not unconstitutional and in
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
29 2019 the US Supreme Court rejected
 
05:01:27.990 --> 05:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
the suit that was claiming the national
 
05:01:31.510 --> 05:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
model and 's currency was
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional since since there are
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
groups in the United States that have
 
05:01:37.150 --> 05:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
the time and the financial backing to
 
05:01:40.030 --> 05:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
bring suit perhaps the mere threat of a
 
05:01:42.190 --> 05:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against a school for posting the
 
05:01:45.190 --> 05:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
national model would be enough to stop a
 
05:01:47.230 --> 05:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
school from displaying the national
 
05:01:51.310 --> 05:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
model for fear of a costly court case
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
that is why this bill would protect our
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
schools from any lawsuits if the
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
displaying of our country's National
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
modotto were to be challenged in court
 
05:02:01.868 --> 05:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
the Office of the Attorney General of
 
05:02:04.750 --> 05:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would defend the school in
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
the court Mr chair and members of the
 
05:02:09.430 --> 05:02:09.440 align:start position:0%

representative true are there any
 
05:02:19.070 --> 05:02:19.080 align:start position:0%

representative Woodcock thank you uh
 
05:02:25.350 --> 05:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative lad and representative
 
05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
Tru thank you for taking my question I
 
05:02:29.868 --> 05:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
recall hearing you speak last year on
 
05:02:32.708 --> 05:02:32.718 align:start position:0%
this I think it was 1148 or 1140 ser
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
iies bill um if I recall correctly and
 
05:02:37.390 --> 05:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
and the national model we're talking
 
05:02:39.430 --> 05:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
about which you didn't say I thought
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
those are the four words you're going to
 
05:02:43.990 --> 05:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
say when you started the dialogue um is
 
05:02:47.470 --> 05:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
In God We Trust which I have uh a great
 
05:02:50.430 --> 05:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
belief that being said however many
 
05:02:52.830 --> 05:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
others who attend school do not happen
 
05:02:55.110 --> 05:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
to have the same belief that I do or
 
05:02:57.788 --> 05:02:57.798 align:start position:0%
that you may have and I wonder why we
 
05:03:01.670 --> 05:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
would we would uh put uh
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
this uh ideology in all of our schools
 
05:03:08.190 --> 05:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
or allow School building to be used for
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
that by as a law uh when we have such a
 
05:03:14.510 --> 05:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
diverse population of folks that come to
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
the schools that are believers or not
 
05:03:18.868 --> 05:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
Believers why should we have just one
 
05:03:22.270 --> 05:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
sec belief there please it's my
 
05:03:25.548 --> 05:03:25.558 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the question
 
05:03:28.750 --> 05:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
um the national model is in all on all
 
05:03:32.190 --> 05:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
our currency it is simply what it is
 
05:03:35.708 --> 05:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
it's the National model of our country
 
05:03:39.070 --> 05:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
um many courts especially the eth
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court which I think is in St
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
Louis for saying that it is not uh an
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
infringement upon Congress you make no
 
05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
law it is simply uh uh the national
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
model has been since uh 1955 I read I
 
05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
read nothing more into those four words
 
05:03:59.948 --> 05:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
then it is the motto of our
 
05:04:03.270 --> 05:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
country followup representative lad
 
05:04:06.628 --> 05:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
right thank you well repres true
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
understand it's not an
 
05:04:10.590 --> 05:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
infringement um but though my question
 
05:04:14.150 --> 05:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
was why should we put those four words
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
of which I happen to be a strong
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
believer why should we put those four
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
words in our school buildings um when it
 
05:04:25.070 --> 05:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
may uh disenfranchise many of the
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
youngsters and students to come and
 
05:04:29.350 --> 05:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
faculty to come into that building why
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
would we uh identify a particular
 
05:04:37.150 --> 05:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
belief I I don't care if it's on money I
 
05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
wish I had more of it but that's not the
 
05:04:43.548 --> 05:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
point uh the circuit courts have ruled
 
05:04:46.990 --> 05:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
it is uh it is not uh about a belief it
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
is simply the national modotto um I
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
believe the uh the argument being made
 
05:04:56.868 --> 05:04:56.878 align:start position:0%
was the argument that was made by the
 
05:04:59.708 --> 05:04:59.718 align:start position:0%
into the E circuit court that some
 
05:05:01.990 --> 05:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
people are could be offended by the
 
05:05:04.150 --> 05:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
national model because it has the word
 
05:05:07.150 --> 05:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
God in it and the that's what the that's
 
05:05:09.670 --> 05:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
what the eth Circuit Court
 
05:05:12.590 --> 05:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
rejected um that that it was not un
 
05:05:15.310 --> 05:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional to have the word God in
 
05:05:19.948 --> 05:05:19.958 align:start position:0%
a national model since since uh
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
1955 thank you repres TR he didn't
 
05:05:23.910 --> 05:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
answer the question but thank you thank
 
05:05:26.030 --> 05:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
you representative ladc are there
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
further questions have represent true
 
05:05:32.990 --> 05:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair uh
 
05:05:34.948 --> 05:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
true I'd like to follow up on
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock's uh question
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
with my own forward question uh which is
 
05:05:43.030 --> 05:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die which is our state
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
model for Words which is on our state
 
05:05:47.310 --> 05:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
license plate but my question is do you
 
05:05:50.270 --> 05:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
do you see this National
 
05:05:53.788 --> 05:05:53.798 align:start position:0%
model uh requirement is analogous uh
 
05:05:56.310 --> 05:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
similar to the state model requirement
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
where we have that on state license
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
plates and
 
05:06:03.190 --> 05:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
elsewhere um
 
05:06:06.190 --> 05:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
all all states well well Most states
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
that I know of they all have their
 
05:06:09.750 --> 05:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
individual State model or whatever
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
phrase they're going to put on their
 
05:06:14.350 --> 05:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
license plates
 
05:06:17.590 --> 05:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
um I I believe it was a few years ago uh
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
there was there was a bill in the house
 
05:06:23.350 --> 05:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh to do away with the state motto
 
05:06:25.070 --> 05:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
because they thought it was too
 
05:06:25.080 --> 05:06:27.110 align:start position:0%
because they thought it was too
violent

05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
violent
 
05:06:30.590 --> 05:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
um and and to that I I say the same
 
05:06:33.430 --> 05:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
thing about the national
 
05:06:36.070 --> 05:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
modotto it is the state motto is not a
 
05:06:41.230 --> 05:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
motto thank you are there further

raised and
 
05:07:05.390 --> 05:07:05.400 align:start position:0%

05:07:09.150 --> 05:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
true okay so we're gonna close this
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
hearing down but get the
 
05:07:14.750 --> 05:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
number we have Carl AD school
 
05:07:17.350 --> 05:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
administrator associ just raise his
 
05:07:19.270 --> 05:07:19.280 align:start position:0%

05:07:19.280 --> 05:07:21.350 align:start position:0%
hand almost like he went through a
yellow

05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%

light go ahead Mr lad okay Carl you're
 
05:07:28.070 --> 05:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
up on Deck here sorry Mr chairman um I
 
05:07:31.948 --> 05:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
thought I had signed up to to speak um I
 
05:07:31.958 --> 05:07:32.948 align:start position:0%
thought I had signed up to to speak um I
think

05:07:32.948 --> 05:07:32.958 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:07:36.190 --> 05:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
um I I hesitate to insert myself into
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
this type of uh discussion but I I I
 
05:07:41.948 --> 05:07:41.958 align:start position:0%
think it's important the phrase In God
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
We Trust isn't something that was
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
conjured up by the founders I was first
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
used on a coin uh by the North in the
 
05:07:53.830 --> 05:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
Civil War and it wasn't until 1956
 
05:07:56.910 --> 05:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
during the Red Scare um when our country
 
05:07:59.110 --> 05:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to strike a blow against quote
 
05:08:01.830 --> 05:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
unquote Godless communism in the Soviet
 
05:08:04.470 --> 05:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
Union that the bill passed President
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
Eisenhower did sign it um and that
 
05:08:10.590 --> 05:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
phrase replaced the much more inclusive
 
05:08:14.190 --> 05:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
urbus Unum which used to be on our
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
currency uh out of many one um which had
 
05:08:21.190 --> 05:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
served as our national motto since
 
05:08:25.230 --> 05:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
1782 um when we say that the phrase In
 
05:08:28.830 --> 05:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
God We Trust isn't really religious um I
 
05:08:30.910 --> 05:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that's exactly
 
05:08:33.628 --> 05:08:33.638 align:start position:0%
accurate um it's obviously a religious
 
05:08:35.948 --> 05:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
phrase uh it's one that puts the
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
government in the position of taking a
 
05:08:41.150 --> 05:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
stand on theology the phrase asserts
 
05:08:44.670 --> 05:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
that there is one God not five not 20
 
05:08:47.548 --> 05:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
not no God and it says you should trust
 
05:08:50.830 --> 05:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
in this God the implication is that this
 
05:08:53.788 --> 05:08:53.798 align:start position:0%
is what Real Americans do if you choose
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
not to are these people to be considered
 
05:08:58.830 --> 05:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
suspect or
 
05:09:01.230 --> 05:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
unpatriotic when we have signs or
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
posters commun communicating this kind
 
05:09:06.270 --> 05:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
of statement posted in public schools
 
05:09:07.670 --> 05:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
and put in front of our most
 
05:09:10.390 --> 05:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
impressionable youngsters the message is
 
05:09:12.990 --> 05:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
not subtle the students are being told
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
that their Public School A
 
05:09:17.190 --> 05:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
government-run institution wants them to
 
05:09:21.110 --> 05:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
believe in and indeed trust in God for
 
05:09:22.868 --> 05:09:22.878 align:start position:0%
parents and children who don't accept
 
05:09:25.948 --> 05:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
that view um or even the existence of
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
God uh the harm is real and it can be
 
05:09:32.430 --> 05:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
palpable for those families um this this

IEP The District Court ruled for the
 
05:31:16.230 --> 05:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
schafers but the fourth cir fourth
 
05:31:18.948 --> 05:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court reversed that decision I
 
05:31:22.868 --> 05:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
should mention that the uh schafers got
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
services from the district only after
 
05:31:27.788 --> 05:31:27.798 align:start position:0%
the Court ruled for the

that the general rule that the party
 
05:31:40.030 --> 05:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
initiating the suit Bears the burden
 
05:31:43.270 --> 05:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
should be applied that set the stage for

interesting
 
05:31:51.030 --> 05:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
discussion the court majority agreed
 
05:31:52.590 --> 05:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
that the party seeking relief should
 
05:31:56.230 --> 05:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
bear the burden but the court declined
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
to address the question of whether
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
States on their own could adopt
 
05:32:02.670 --> 05:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
legislation or regulations assigning the
 
05:32:04.310 --> 05:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
burden to the school
 
05:32:07.350 --> 05:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
district in the majority opinion Justice
 
05:32:11.150 --> 05:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
okono wrote we need not decide this
 
05:32:14.430 --> 05:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
issue today Justice Brier contends that
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
the allocation of the burden ought to be
 
05:32:19.390 --> 05:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
left entirely up to the state but
 
05:32:21.510 --> 05:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
neither party made that argument before
 
05:32:24.628 --> 05:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
this court we therefore declin to
 
05:32:24.638 --> 05:32:25.628 align:start position:0%
this court we therefore declin to
address

05:32:25.628 --> 05:32:25.638 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
it so in that Supreme Court case nine
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
States filed briefs supporting the idea
 
05:32:34.948 --> 05:32:34.958 align:start position:0%
that the burden should fall on the
 
05:32:38.548 --> 05:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
district since that decision in
 
05:32:42.310 --> 05:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
2005 number of States including
 
05:32:45.548 --> 05:32:45.558 align:start position:0%
Connecticut New York New Jersey have
 
05:32:50.190 --> 05:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
passed similar uh laws to HB
 
05:32:53.548 --> 05:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
581 let me touch on one detail in the
 
05:32:56.868 --> 05:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
bill on lines three and four you will
 
05:33:00.030 --> 05:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
note that the the terms burden approv
 
05:33:02.070 --> 05:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
Pro and burden excuse me burden of
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
production and burden of
 
05:33:07.350 --> 05:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
persuasion uh burden of proof
 
05:33:09.470 --> 05:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
encompasses both these
 
05:33:12.868 --> 05:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
principles as Justice OK Conor wrote the
 
05:33:16.750 --> 05:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
term burden of burden of proof is
 
05:33:20.948 --> 05:33:20.958 align:start position:0%
slippery in terms of family legal terms
 
05:33:22.990 --> 05:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
part of the confusion surrounding the
 
05:33:25.470 --> 05:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
term arises from the fact that the
 
05:33:27.830 --> 05:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
concept en encompasses both these
 
05:33:30.910 --> 05:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
distinct burdens persu
 
05:33:30.920 --> 05:33:31.830 align:start position:0%
distinct burdens persu
and

05:33:31.830 --> 05:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:34.628 --> 05:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
production production meaning that you
 
05:33:37.190 --> 05:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
must offer evidence to be allowed to
 
05:33:39.628 --> 05:33:39.638 align:start position:0%
proceed and persuasion meaning that you
 
05:33:42.270 --> 05:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
have to convince of the existence of
 
05:33:44.750 --> 05:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
facts to Prevail in the
 
05:33:49.270 --> 05:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
case that is why in HB 581 we assigned
 
05:33:52.628 --> 05:33:52.638 align:start position:0%
both burdens to the school district to
 
05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that there was no
 
05:33:56.590 --> 05:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
confusion and why should we place the
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
burden of proof on districts I'll start
 
05:34:00.868 --> 05:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
with a quote from the late Justice
 
05:34:03.310 --> 05:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
Ginsburg and her descent in this Supreme
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
Court case uh she cited the prior fourth
 
05:34:09.350 --> 05:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
circuit court and mentioning that the
 
05:34:12.590 --> 05:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
party with the bigger guns but she she
 
05:34:16.430 --> 05:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
went on to write that they have better
 
05:34:19.548 --> 05:34:19.558 align:start position:0%
access to information greater expertise
 
05:34:21.788 --> 05:34:21.798 align:start position:0%
and an affirmative obligation to provide
 
05:34:24.430 --> 05:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
the contestant services policy
 
05:34:26.990 --> 05:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
considerations convenience and fairness
 
05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
I think it plain point in the same
 
05:34:29.360 --> 05:34:30.910 align:start position:0%
I think it plain point in the same
direction

05:34:30.910 --> 05:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
direction
 
05:34:32.788 --> 05:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
their collectively warrants a rule
 
05:34:34.990 --> 05:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
requiring the school district in due
 
05:34:38.310 --> 05:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
process hearings to explain persuasively
 
05:34:42.788 --> 05:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
why it's proposed IEP satisfies Ida
 
05:34:45.628 --> 05:34:45.638 align:start position:0%
standards I believe that Justice
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
Ginsburg was right parents don't have
 
05:34:50.350 --> 05:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
the resources to take on a school
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
district it can be very expensive to
 
05:34:54.948 --> 05:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
hire a lawyer parents don't have the
 
05:34:57.670 --> 05:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
legal resources document or information
 
05:35:00.350 --> 05:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
that a school district does they don't
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
have the ability to interview School
 
05:35:04.990 --> 05:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
staff before a hearing the parents are
 
05:35:07.628 --> 05:35:07.638 align:start position:0%
at a disadvantage and that is why we
 
05:35:11.310 --> 05:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
have so few de due process hearings uh
 
05:35:13.470 --> 05:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
we've had written testimony from a
 
05:35:16.510 --> 05:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
number of people said saying you why why
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
do I want to go to this expense when I'm
 
05:35:24.150 --> 05:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the resources to Prevail
 
05:35:27.548 --> 05:35:27.558 align:start position:0%
and I would like to comment on um other
 
05:35:30.350 --> 05:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
written testimony that we received
 
05:35:33.310 --> 05:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
um three points if I could um in the
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
testimony it states imposing the burden
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
of production on school districts is bad
 
05:35:41.430 --> 05:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
policy because it will unnecessarily
 
05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
prolong special ad
 
05:35:46.110 --> 05:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
hearings putting the burden of
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
production on parents does not prolong
 
05:35:50.750 --> 05:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
hearings probably not because they don't
 
05:35:53.788 --> 05:35:53.798 align:start position:0%
have the resources to provide all the
 
05:35:56.150 --> 05:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
background information the lawyers and
 
05:36:00.270 --> 05:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
the testimony that uh that the school
 
05:36:00.280 --> 05:36:01.310 align:start position:0%
the testimony that uh that the school
district

05:36:01.310 --> 05:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:36:01.320 --> 05:36:05.910 align:start position:0%
district
does

05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:08.350 --> 05:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
secondly HB
 
05:36:12.030 --> 05:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
581 will increase local costs while no
 
05:36:14.548 --> 05:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
offering no additional State funding to
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
cover the costs so again here we raised
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
the boogeyman of increased local
 
05:36:23.788 --> 05:36:23.798 align:start position:0%
costs but they refuse again to talk
 
05:36:26.670 --> 05:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
about the kids and what about the human
 
05:36:29.230 --> 05:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
costs we talk about the monetary costs
 
05:36:31.270 --> 05:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
but what about the human cost in this
 
05:36:35.628 --> 05:36:35.638 align:start position:0%
case special uh needs children and
 
05:36:38.868 --> 05:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
thirdly uh it is difficult to it is
 
05:36:40.510 --> 05:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
already difficult for school districts
 
05:36:43.510 --> 05:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
to Prevail at special edit hearings oh
 
05:36:46.110 --> 05:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
really hearing officers naturally
 
05:36:48.430 --> 05:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
sympath sympathize with students who
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
have disabilities and with their
 
05:36:53.230 --> 05:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
parents sometimes hearing officers
 
05:36:55.470 --> 05:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
Overlook that public resources are
 
05:36:57.990 --> 05:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
finite when a district spends more money
 
05:37:00.430 --> 05:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
on one student it must raise taxes or
 
05:37:02.070 --> 05:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
cut programs for other
 
05:37:05.470 --> 05:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
children hearing officers do not decide
 
05:37:09.310 --> 05:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
the facts on decide the case on facts
 
05:37:11.910 --> 05:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
but on emotions about who they feel
 
05:37:11.920 --> 05:37:13.270 align:start position:0%
but on emotions about who they feel
sorry

05:37:13.270 --> 05:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:37:15.708 --> 05:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
for um maybe someone from the Department
 
05:37:19.150 --> 05:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
could comment on that but troubling to
 
05:37:22.708 --> 05:37:22.718 align:start position:0%
me the district has finite resources
 
05:37:25.590 --> 05:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
what about parents what about their
 
05:37:28.070 --> 05:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
resources there's no there's no
 
05:37:31.030 --> 05:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
equivalency here it's out outrageous in
 
05:37:33.270 --> 05:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
my opinion that statement is one of the
 
05:37:35.788 --> 05:37:35.798 align:start position:0%
most troubling that I've heard in in a
 
05:37:35.798 --> 05:37:36.788 align:start position:0%
most troubling that I've heard in in a
long

05:37:36.788 --> 05:37:36.798 align:start position:0%
long
 
05:37:40.030 --> 05:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
time so this is really about a matter of
 
05:37:43.030 --> 05:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
fairness it's fairness for parents and
 
05:37:45.948 --> 05:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
fairness for children with children with
 
05:37:48.670 --> 05:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities they need to have a Level
 
05:37:51.470 --> 05:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
Playing Field when they go to a deep due
 
05:37:55.670 --> 05:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
process hearing and HB 581 will provide
 
05:37:59.270 --> 05:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
them with that Level Playing Field thank
 
05:38:01.990 --> 05:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you very much are
 
05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
there questions for representative
 
05:38:07.868 --> 05:38:07.878 align:start position:0%
cordelli rep Miler rep Miler thank you
 
05:38:10.030 --> 05:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you representative
 
05:38:13.310 --> 05:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli for taking my question so if
 
05:38:14.990 --> 05:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
this bill were to become
 
05:38:18.590 --> 05:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
law can you explain how it would change
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
things what what would how how it would
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
look different than what we currently
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
have um right now uh when a parent U
 
05:38:32.430 --> 05:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
files for a due process hearing it is a
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh the burden of proof the burden of
 
05:38:37.390 --> 05:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
production and persuasion is on the
 
05:38:40.548 --> 05:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
parent they must convince the hearing
 
05:38:44.350 --> 05:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
officer that the proposed IEP does not
 
05:38:46.468 --> 05:38:46.478 align:start position:0%
meet the child's needs does not comply
 
05:38:48.510 --> 05:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
with h
 
05:38:52.670 --> 05:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
idea um with 581 the burden of proof
 
05:38:55.110 --> 05:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
would be on the school district they
 
05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
have the resources to provide uh the
 
05:39:01.510 --> 05:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
information um that the parents do not
 
05:39:03.350 --> 05:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that is why it
 
05:39:04.750 --> 05:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
levels the
 
05:39:07.868 --> 05:39:07.878 align:start position:0%
playing a followup
 
05:39:10.628 --> 05:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
please and and the who is the hearing
 
05:39:14.670 --> 05:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
offer officer in this m c um I believe
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
that they are appointed by the
 
05:39:17.708 --> 05:39:17.718 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
05:39:21.510 --> 05:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
Education so if I may then uh the an
 
05:39:23.590 --> 05:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
independent person comes in in this
 
05:39:27.430 --> 05:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
hearing under this law and rather as I
 
05:39:28.990 --> 05:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
understand it rather than having the
 
05:39:29.000 --> 05:39:30.948 align:start position:0%
understand it rather than having the
parent

05:39:30.948 --> 05:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
parent
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
having to provide whatever
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
documentation uh medical records uh
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
whatever they might be the school
 
05:39:40.750 --> 05:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
district then would basic would
 
05:39:42.990 --> 05:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
basically switch at that point in time
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
where the school district would then
 
05:39:47.628 --> 05:39:47.638 align:start position:0%
have to basically provide that burden
 
05:39:50.670 --> 05:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
rather than the parent is that correct
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
right they would have to Pro they would
 
05:39:55.510 --> 05:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
have to convince the uh hearing officer
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
that um their proposed uh services um
 
05:40:03.430 --> 05:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
plan um does meet the needs of the child
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
rather than the other way around okay
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that
 
05:40:09.628 --> 05:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
clarification I appreciate that thank
 
05:40:12.030 --> 05:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
you uh are there further questions for
 
05:40:12.040 --> 05:40:13.390 align:start position:0%
you uh are there further questions for
representa

05:40:13.390 --> 05:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
representa
 
05:40:16.190 --> 05:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
cordelli represent
 
05:40:19.270 --> 05:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
wood thank you representative lad and
 
05:40:20.628 --> 05:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cell for just
 
05:40:22.230 --> 05:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have I have two
 
05:40:24.468 --> 05:40:24.478 align:start position:0%
questions the first one is probably the
 
05:40:26.270 --> 05:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
easier the two I guess how how do you
 
05:40:27.350 --> 05:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
how are they going to measure
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
preponderance what does that actually
 
05:40:28.920 --> 05:40:32.110 align:start position:0%
preponderance what does that actually
mean

05:40:32.110 --> 05:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:34.430 --> 05:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
um maybe I'll leave that uh if there's a
 
05:40:37.708 --> 05:40:37.718 align:start position:0%
lawyer here as to the termination of the
 
05:40:40.110 --> 05:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
prance of evidence but I think it's the
 
05:40:45.030 --> 05:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
bulk of the prance um be more than
 
05:40:48.468 --> 05:40:48.478 align:start position:0%
50% but U I'll really leave that to a
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:56.190 --> 05:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
please so the the school district could
 
05:40:59.468 --> 05:40:59.478 align:start position:0%
create this as you said volume of
 
05:41:01.190 --> 05:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
production wouldn't that be a
 
05:41:04.670 --> 05:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
preponderance of
 
05:41:08.230 --> 05:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
data um it's production but it's not
 
05:41:08.240 --> 05:41:09.948 align:start position:0%
data um it's production but it's not
necessarily

05:41:09.948 --> 05:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
05:41:12.670 --> 05:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
persuasion so and final final question
 
05:41:16.030 --> 05:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chair how how does how does
 
05:41:18.990 --> 05:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
this process that you're
 
05:41:21.030 --> 05:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
recommending differ from the current
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
special ed complaint process
 
05:41:26.948 --> 05:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
now um when there's a special a
 
05:41:29.910 --> 05:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
complaint um there are several steps
 
05:41:33.350 --> 05:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
that can be um uh initiated by a parent
 
05:41:36.830 --> 05:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
including mediation due process is the
 
05:41:40.070 --> 05:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh the final step um and that's the
 
05:41:43.390 --> 05:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
existing process um I'm not changing
 
05:41:46.830 --> 05:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
that process at all I'm just changing in
 
05:41:49.230 --> 05:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
a due process hearing um who has to
 
05:41:49.240 --> 05:41:51.110 align:start position:0%
a due process hearing um who has to
person

05:41:51.110 --> 05:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:41:54.510 --> 05:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
Pro just the one last final so are you
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there's not a
 
05:41:56.558 --> 05:41:58.150 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there's not a
difference

05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
difference
 
05:42:01.030 --> 05:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
of a difference between the due process
 
05:42:04.708 --> 05:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
hearing and a special ed complaint
 
05:42:10.110 --> 05:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
hearing there is there is um this is uh
 
05:42:13.150 --> 05:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:16.390 --> 05:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
processing thank you thank you Mr for CH
 
05:42:19.590 --> 05:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
M you're welcome are there any H further
 
05:42:22.390 --> 05:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
05:42:25.670 --> 05:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli rep represent
 
05:42:28.468 --> 05:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:42:31.750 --> 05:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative of cordelli so o okay
 
05:42:34.468 --> 05:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
not to be obtuse here but tell me if
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
I've got this right as the law is
 
05:42:41.590 --> 05:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
written right now if a parent takes a
 
05:42:44.708 --> 05:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
school district to doe process the
 
05:42:48.190 --> 05:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
parent has to go in and produce all the
 
05:42:50.590 --> 05:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
physical evidence and the
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
persuasion to convince the hearing
 
05:42:57.230 --> 05:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
officer that the school is not doing
 
05:43:02.110 --> 05:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
enough or not meeting the needs of the
 
05:43:04.350 --> 05:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
child I'm sorry that's the way it is
 
05:43:08.590 --> 05:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
right now right whoever files the
 
05:43:11.468 --> 05:43:11.478 align:start position:0%
complaint is responsible all right so in
 
05:43:13.590 --> 05:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
the case of a parent thinking that the
 
05:43:16.750 --> 05:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
school isn't doing enough then the
 
05:43:18.430 --> 05:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
parent would have to come up with the
 
05:43:21.070 --> 05:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
argument and all the evidence but if we
 
05:43:25.150 --> 05:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
were to adopt this and a parent filed
 
05:43:27.310 --> 05:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
for due process and said the school's
 
05:43:29.788 --> 05:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
not doing enough then then what this
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
would do is put the school in the
 
05:43:35.110 --> 05:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
position of having to go in and say we
 
05:43:37.350 --> 05:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
are doing enough here's all of this
 
05:43:39.548 --> 05:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
evidence and here's the
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
persuasion that indicates that we're
 
05:43:43.830 --> 05:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
doing enough they would have to come up
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
with the information to defend
 
05:43:49.750 --> 05:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
themselves yes okay all right thank you
 
05:43:52.590 --> 05:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
just making sure I I I I wasn't chasing
 
05:43:54.270 --> 05:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
my own tail
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
here thank you uh further
 
05:43:58.000 --> 05:44:01.430 align:start position:0%
here thank you uh further
questions

05:44:01.430 --> 05:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:04.390 --> 05:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
not see any hands here or there thank
 
05:44:06.788 --> 05:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
you very much represent cordelli okay
 
05:44:09.510 --> 05:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
next speaker is Mary Gibbon Stevens and
 
05:44:12.788 --> 05:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
I promoted her go ahead and welcome to
 
05:44:16.510 --> 05:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
education thank you um so yes my name is
 
05:44:18.868 --> 05:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
Mary Stevens I'm an attorney I practice
 
05:44:21.430 --> 05:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
with the law firm in KY Maine and I've
 
05:44:24.190 --> 05:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
been practicing law for over 30 years in
 
05:44:27.390 --> 05:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
different roles as in child advocacy and
 
05:44:29.830 --> 05:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
one uh part of my ad advocacy has been
 
05:44:31.948 --> 05:44:31.958 align:start position:0%
in protecting the educational rights of
 
05:44:34.030 --> 05:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
disabled children and their parents
 
05:44:36.948 --> 05:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
under idea that representative cordelli
 
05:44:39.788 --> 05:44:39.798 align:start position:0%
was just mentioning um and the purpose
 
05:44:42.390 --> 05:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
of idea is to ensure that disabled
 
05:44:44.830 --> 05:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
children are provided with what we call
 
05:44:46.628 --> 05:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
well what the statute says is a free and
 
05:44:48.910 --> 05:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate education a free and
 
05:44:51.190 --> 05:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education that we
 
05:44:53.788 --> 05:44:53.798 align:start position:0%
refer to as fate that's the acronym that
 
05:44:56.788 --> 05:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
we use um and the purpose is also so
 
05:44:59.910 --> 05:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
that uh disabled children can achieve
 
05:45:02.190 --> 05:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
further education employment and
 
05:45:04.590 --> 05:45:04.600 align:start position:0%
independent living so basically in the
 
05:45:07.350 --> 05:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
big picture the purpose is to allow
 
05:45:11.910 --> 05:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
children and and to um to have states
 
05:45:14.430 --> 05:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
spend the money on children's education
 
05:45:16.548 --> 05:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
when they're young so that when they
 
05:45:19.110 --> 05:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
finish their education their secondary
 
05:45:22.670 --> 05:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
education they can become uh taxpayers
 
05:45:26.230 --> 05:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
and fully uh you know um members of
 
05:45:28.030 --> 05:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
society and our and contributing members
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
of our communities so but like many laws
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
while idea gives parents and children
 
05:45:38.030 --> 05:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
with disabilities um several rights um
 
05:45:40.868 --> 05:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
it does not always uh the intent is not
 
05:45:43.510 --> 05:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
always played out in reality in
 
05:45:46.230 --> 05:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
practice and parents really do I want to
 
05:45:50.948 --> 05:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
say that I Echo 100% from my you know
 
05:45:52.910 --> 05:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
day-to-day experience what
 
05:45:55.788 --> 05:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli has described
 
05:45:59.990 --> 05:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
and explained I second it completely um
 
05:46:02.510 --> 05:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
so parents of disabled children often
 
05:46:04.510 --> 05:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
face an uphill battle regarding their
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
children's education they in addition to
 
05:46:09.150 --> 05:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
caring for their children they have to
 
05:46:11.670 --> 05:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
learn all they can about their child's
 
05:46:13.788 --> 05:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
disability and they have to become
 
05:46:15.670 --> 05:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
experts not only about their own
 
05:46:17.830 --> 05:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
individual children but about the
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
condition or conditions that impact
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
their development then they have to
 
05:46:23.270 --> 05:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
advocate for them to receive an
 
05:46:26.030 --> 05:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate education now when parents
 
05:46:28.590 --> 05:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
are treated as equal members of the team
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
the system can actually work very well
 
05:46:33.190 --> 05:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately there are many times
 
05:46:35.548 --> 05:46:35.558 align:start position:0%
when parents are not viewed as experts
 
05:46:37.750 --> 05:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
at the table and they're not treated as
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
equal members of the team and when that
 
05:46:42.548 --> 05:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
happens and parents assert that the
 
05:46:44.590 --> 05:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
school is not providing their child with
 
05:46:46.750 --> 05:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
Fae they can request a due process
 
05:46:49.468 --> 05:46:49.478 align:start position:0%
hearing as you heard and this hearing is
 
05:46:51.990 --> 05:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
intended to be an efficient
 
05:46:54.390 --> 05:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
administrative review it is not intended
 
05:46:57.350 --> 05:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
to be lengthy litigation but the truth
 
05:46:59.708 --> 05:46:59.718 align:start position:0%
is it's a complicated and difficult
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
legal process the federal and state laws
 
05:47:06.670 --> 05:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
and regulations are very very long and
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
their dense now New Hampshire has a
 
05:47:11.510 --> 05:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
parent friendly Guide to the New
 
05:47:13.868 --> 05:47:13.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire special education regulations
 
05:47:17.948 --> 05:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
the parent friendly guide is 282 pages
 
05:47:21.030 --> 05:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
long that just gives you an idea that in
 
05:47:23.150 --> 05:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
addition to all the caregiving and other
 
05:47:25.070 --> 05:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities parents have they have
 
05:47:27.030 --> 05:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
to familiarize themselves with hundreds
 
05:47:30.030 --> 05:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
of pages of detailed legal language in
 
05:47:31.670 --> 05:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
order to assert their child's right to
 
05:47:34.948 --> 05:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
an education and even when they get that
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
understanding they're often still at it
 
05:47:39.708 --> 05:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
at a disadvantage and I want to um
 
05:47:41.468 --> 05:47:41.478 align:start position:0%
respond a little bit to the questions
 
05:47:44.510 --> 05:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
that were raised earlier if you think
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
about you know Lady Justice the scales
 
05:47:49.350 --> 05:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
of Justice the the woman with the
 
05:47:51.670 --> 05:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
blindfold and holding the scales of
 
05:47:55.510 --> 05:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
Justice what we're talking about is who
 
05:47:56.750 --> 05:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
has to
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
prove the the Tipping the scales of the
 
05:48:02.270 --> 05:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
justice and there uh the and there was a
 
05:48:03.788 --> 05:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
question about preponderance of the
 
05:48:06.990 --> 05:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that's what it is like who like
 
05:48:09.390 --> 05:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
are does the evidence lean on one side
 
05:48:11.548 --> 05:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
or the other and so who has the burden
 
05:48:14.708 --> 05:48:14.718 align:start position:0%
of proving that in reality the process
 
05:48:16.830 --> 05:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
is not going to be any different because
 
05:48:18.910 --> 05:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
as uh representative cordelli said there
 
05:48:21.548 --> 05:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
are some cases in which a district will
 
05:48:24.270 --> 05:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
initiate the due process hearing in that
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
case the district has the burden of
 
05:48:29.510 --> 05:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
proof in any of these cases both sides
 
05:48:31.708 --> 05:48:31.718 align:start position:0%
produce the evidence that they want to
 
05:48:34.110 --> 05:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
produce whether you are asserting the
 
05:48:35.670 --> 05:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
case or whether you're defending the
 
05:48:38.430 --> 05:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
case you are asserting the same evidence
 
05:48:40.750 --> 05:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
but the reason that this is so important
 
05:48:43.310 --> 05:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
and truly is leveling the playing field
 
05:48:46.430 --> 05:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
is for the uh reasons that uh that
 
05:48:48.670 --> 05:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli mentioned that
 
05:48:51.150 --> 05:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
um Justice Ginsburg had mentioned in her
 
05:48:54.190 --> 05:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh descent the school is the holder of
 
05:48:56.030 --> 05:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
the information and the evidence
 
05:48:58.590 --> 05:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
regarding the child's education parents
 
05:49:01.030 --> 05:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
do not know what happens at school on a
 
05:49:04.270 --> 05:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis now it's not unusual I
 
05:49:05.990 --> 05:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
will tell you for teachers and other
 
05:49:07.590 --> 05:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
staff members to give parents
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
information off the Record and it's
 
05:49:12.070 --> 05:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
understandable that the same people are
 
05:49:14.030 --> 05:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
then unwilling to speak up in a way that
 
05:49:16.390 --> 05:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
would impact their employment this is a
 
05:49:18.830 --> 05:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
reality that happens sometimes and
 
05:49:20.590 --> 05:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
parents often have to fight with schools
 
05:49:23.030 --> 05:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
to obtain documents and other evidence
 
05:49:25.110 --> 05:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
and even after several requests all the
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
information may not be provided and
 
05:49:29.150 --> 05:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
since the school is the holder of the
 
05:49:30.868 --> 05:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
evidence the school should bear the
 
05:49:33.628 --> 05:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
burden of proof at Heering and in order
 
05:49:35.468 --> 05:49:35.478 align:start position:0%
for parents to prove that their children
 
05:49:37.390 --> 05:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
did not receive fape from the school
 
05:49:39.830 --> 05:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
district they usually need the testimony
 
05:49:42.510 --> 05:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
of one or more expert Witnesses and the
 
05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
schools have a variety of experts on
 
05:49:47.788 --> 05:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
staff calling those experts to testify
 
05:49:50.230 --> 05:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
may not call uh may not cost the school
 
05:49:52.750 --> 05:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
district extra money but parents have to
 
05:49:55.190 --> 05:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
find and retain experts at their own
 
05:49:58.670 --> 05:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
expense and Shifting the burden of proof
 
05:50:01.390 --> 05:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
uh from the school uh I mean from the
 
05:50:03.910 --> 05:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
parents to the school May alleviate some
 
05:50:06.788 --> 05:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
of the expenses incurred by the parents
 
05:50:09.430 --> 05:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
pursuing due process because they don't
 
05:50:12.430 --> 05:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
have that hurdle quite as high a hurdle
 
05:50:15.628 --> 05:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
to prove they still need to convince the
 
05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing officer there're still the
 
05:50:19.670 --> 05:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
two sides of the argument but they don't
 
05:50:23.110 --> 05:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
have that that such a high hurdle
 
05:50:26.350 --> 05:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
finally it is the school that has the
 
05:50:28.708 --> 05:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide fate for the the
 
05:50:30.590 --> 05:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
child parents have their own
 
05:50:32.468 --> 05:50:32.478 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but when it comes to
 
05:50:35.670 --> 05:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
educating a disabled child the duty
 
05:50:38.788 --> 05:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
rests squarely upon the school district
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
the school district has the obligation
 
05:50:42.990 --> 05:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
to educate so the school district should
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
have the burden of proving it has done
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
so when parents raise a challenge so
 
05:50:51.310 --> 05:50:51.320 align:start position:0%
this bill will help to protect the
 
05:50:53.390 --> 05:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
rights of the most vulnerable members of
 
05:50:56.468 --> 05:50:56.478 align:start position:0%
our society disabled children and I urge
 
05:51:00.030 --> 05:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
you to uh pass and approve and support
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'm willing to take any
 
05:51:06.670 --> 05:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh St uh
 
05:51:08.110 --> 05:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
05:51:11.548 --> 05:51:11.558 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee represent
 
05:51:14.590 --> 05:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
Miler uh thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:51:17.070 --> 05:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
you uh Miss Stevens for taking my
 
05:51:20.150 --> 05:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
question I I have I have two uh
 
05:51:23.670 --> 05:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
questions really uh one in your
 
05:51:28.868 --> 05:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
experience um how what percent of the
 
05:51:31.708 --> 05:51:31.718 align:start position:0%
um issues that you deal with are
 
05:51:34.708 --> 05:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
resolved in mediation that's the first
 
05:51:39.190 --> 05:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
question well um most are you know very
 
05:51:41.670 --> 05:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
most are either resolved at the IEP
 
05:51:45.468 --> 05:51:45.478 align:start position:0%
process in the schools or through um
 
05:51:49.230 --> 05:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
mediation you know it's um going to doe
 
05:51:51.948 --> 05:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
process I going to tell you it is an
 
05:51:55.468 --> 05:51:55.478 align:start position:0%
extreme burden on parents it's a lot of
 
05:51:59.910 --> 05:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
work it is it is not the the efficient
 
05:52:02.430 --> 05:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
hearing that is intended and so we only
 
05:52:04.708 --> 05:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
go to due process as a last resort
 
05:52:07.548 --> 05:52:07.558 align:start position:0%
honestly so so so you would say you're I
 
05:52:08.830 --> 05:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
think you answer the first question that
 
05:52:11.350 --> 05:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
most get resolved either through the IEP
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
process or through a mediation process
 
05:52:16.510 --> 05:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
correct okay so the second question is
 
05:52:20.070 --> 05:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
this is that what is
 
05:52:23.390 --> 05:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
the what's the problem with the school
 
05:52:26.510 --> 05:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
districts as relates to their position
 
05:52:29.230 --> 05:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
typically is it because there are they
 
05:52:32.030 --> 05:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
are fearful of the potential cost that
 
05:52:36.628 --> 05:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
might be incurred here um is and so I'm
 
05:52:38.350 --> 05:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
just kind of wondering what your
 
05:52:40.708 --> 05:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
experience has been in dealing with the
 
05:52:42.910 --> 05:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
school district's position when they go
 
05:52:45.670 --> 05:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
to uh when they go to the due process
 
05:52:49.150 --> 05:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
Harry when they go to Due Process um
 
05:52:51.270 --> 05:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
when we're at that point there's been
 
05:52:53.310 --> 05:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
you know a breakdown usually of trust
 
05:52:55.350 --> 05:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
between the parents and the district I
 
05:52:59.468 --> 05:52:59.478 align:start position:0%
mean it's always you know Ida okay um is
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
it has never been fully funded that's a
 
05:53:04.270 --> 05:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem so there are these
 
05:53:05.708 --> 05:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
you know mandates coming from the
 
05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
federal government to the states and
 
05:53:08.868 --> 05:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
they're never full it's never been fully
 
05:53:10.910 --> 05:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
funded so it all come it often comes
 
05:53:13.468 --> 05:53:13.478 align:start position:0%
down to money even though it's not
 
05:53:15.548 --> 05:53:15.558 align:start position:0%
supposed to come down to money so it's
 
05:53:17.548 --> 05:53:17.558 align:start position:0%
always the elephant in the room you
 
05:53:19.868 --> 05:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
can't say the school district is you
 
05:53:21.628 --> 05:53:21.638 align:start position:0%
know is not supposed to say we can't do
 
05:53:23.350 --> 05:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
that because we can't afford it they're
 
05:53:26.110 --> 05:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to do whatever the child needs
 
05:53:29.788 --> 05:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
but the reality is and I so yeah so that
 
05:53:31.310 --> 05:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
your the statement you said about the
 
05:53:34.350 --> 05:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
breakdown in trust obviously is key the
 
05:53:37.548 --> 05:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
final thing is is um there's been some
 
05:53:41.390 --> 05:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
concern about frivolous cases going
 
05:53:44.590 --> 05:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
forward If This Were to shift in in the
 
05:53:46.590 --> 05:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
burden of proof what's your what's your
 
05:53:50.030 --> 05:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
sense of that comment I honestly
 
05:53:52.430 --> 05:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
honestly cannot see that happening I
 
05:53:55.708 --> 05:53:55.718 align:start position:0%
mean because if if parents I mean it's
 
05:54:00.070 --> 05:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
still it's not like a parent can just um
 
05:54:01.990 --> 05:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
you don't think of any lawsuit right you
 
05:54:06.150 --> 05:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
if if a parent just makes an accusation
 
05:54:07.830 --> 05:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
against a school district with nothing
 
05:54:09.230 --> 05:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
to back it
 
05:54:12.310 --> 05:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
up they still have to are they gonna are
 
05:54:14.948 --> 05:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
they gonna hire an attorney if they're
 
05:54:16.830 --> 05:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
not going to hire an ATT I mean attorney
 
05:54:18.910 --> 05:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
has their we have our ethical obligation
 
05:54:22.270 --> 05:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
to not pursue frivolous cases right so
 
05:54:23.788 --> 05:54:23.798 align:start position:0%
they have to go through that so if
 
05:54:25.990 --> 05:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to do it on their own it's
 
05:54:27.788 --> 05:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
still so much work they still have to
 
05:54:29.468 --> 05:54:29.478 align:start position:0%
get the documents they still have to get
 
05:54:31.628 --> 05:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
experts they still have to produce
 
05:54:34.708 --> 05:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
Witnesses I I just don't see that being
 
05:54:37.310 --> 05:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
a realistic thing it is not a pleasant
 
05:54:40.110 --> 05:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
experience for parents okay thank you
 
05:54:41.910 --> 05:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your input thank
 
05:54:43.270 --> 05:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
you very much you're welcome thank you
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
for your
 
05:54:47.150 --> 05:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
questions Miss Stevens I have a question
 
05:54:49.750 --> 05:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
under current law the way it is right
 
05:54:53.750 --> 05:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
now are there various organizations or
 
05:54:55.430 --> 05:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
groups out there with the funding
 
05:54:58.150 --> 05:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
available for parents to help pursue a
 
05:55:01.350 --> 05:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
case like this or is it a result of
 
05:55:03.510 --> 05:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
parents not having the these Monies to
 
05:55:06.910 --> 05:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
help cost out this horrible situation so
 
05:55:09.670 --> 05:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
they're stopping uh are there agencies
 
05:55:11.548 --> 05:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
out there are there funding sources are
 
05:55:13.350 --> 05:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
there advocacy groups that are willing
 
05:55:16.070 --> 05:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
to take something like this forward
 
05:55:19.548 --> 05:55:19.558 align:start position:0%
there are there are legal aid um so what
 
05:55:22.590 --> 05:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
I what I have found in my practice is
 
05:55:27.510 --> 05:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
that um it it's so it's a it's a very
 
05:55:29.868 --> 05:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
expensive thing for a small Law Firm
 
05:55:31.788 --> 05:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
like myself you know it's very expensive
 
05:55:34.230 --> 05:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of time what I find is
 
05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
that either parents can um go to a law
 
05:55:41.070 --> 05:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
firm that you know requires like tens of
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
thousands you know like
 
05:55:47.430 --> 05:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
$30,000 upfront to to litigate a due
 
05:55:50.750 --> 05:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
process matter or they can go to a legal
 
05:55:53.990 --> 05:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
aid um you know legal aid providers that
 
05:55:56.948 --> 05:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
can do it but they of course um then you
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
have income requ requirements and then
 
05:56:01.990 --> 05:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're really booked and can only take
 
05:56:04.030 --> 05:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
certain cases and then there's you know
 
05:56:06.190 --> 05:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
disability rights and they'll do it but
 
05:56:09.110 --> 05:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
again they're um they're overbooked and
 
05:56:11.750 --> 05:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
can't take all the cases and so it's the
 
05:56:16.548 --> 05:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
sort of um it's the um middle class
 
05:56:19.990 --> 05:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
families that have a hard time with this
 
05:56:22.750 --> 05:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
that can't really afford
 
05:56:27.310 --> 05:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
$30,000 to you know pay for this and so
 
05:56:27.320 --> 05:56:28.590 align:start position:0%
$30,000 to you know pay for this and so
um

05:56:28.590 --> 05:56:28.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:31.230 --> 05:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
there is a fee shifting provision in
 
05:56:35.350 --> 05:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
idea where if parents Prevail then um
 
05:56:39.270 --> 05:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
they the the school district um has to
 
05:56:41.548 --> 05:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
pay their attorney fees but that's after
 
05:56:43.628 --> 05:56:43.638 align:start position:0%
you go through a whole hearing so
 
05:56:45.590 --> 05:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're able to negotiate and
 
05:56:47.590 --> 05:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
get some attorney's fees paid in
 
05:56:49.868 --> 05:56:49.878 align:start position:0%
mediation but it's always you know
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
nickel and dimed and then um but other
 
05:56:55.468 --> 05:56:55.478 align:start position:0%
things are not like expert Witnesses are
 
05:56:58.390 --> 05:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
not paid for by uh the school District
 
05:57:00.510 --> 05:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
even if the parents Prevail so they
 
05:57:04.390 --> 05:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
still have um often very you know high
 
05:57:06.628 --> 05:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
costs and then what happens is that you
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
know we I mean just to be frank you know
 
05:57:11.270 --> 05:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
we end up not being paid our full price
 
05:57:14.110 --> 05:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
we you know our full fees we cut it and
 
05:57:16.390 --> 05:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know in our effort to try to resolve
 
05:57:19.670 --> 05:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
these matters so um but I have not I'm
 
05:57:22.390 --> 05:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
not familiar with any organization I
 
05:57:25.510 --> 05:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
know I have one client now who is trying
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
to get funding from some organizations
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
that help support her disabled child but
 
05:57:34.070 --> 05:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
I have not seen that myself any
 
05:57:35.468 --> 05:57:35.478 align:start position:0%
organizations that have been able to
 
05:57:38.948 --> 05:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
fund um this and you know like it's very
 
05:57:41.390 --> 05:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
costly and so sometimes I mean I'll be
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
perfectly Frank with you sometimes it's
 
05:57:45.990 --> 05:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
much better for parents to put their
 
05:57:48.030 --> 05:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
money towards supplementing the
 
05:57:50.350 --> 05:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
education and put it towards a tutor or
 
05:57:52.750 --> 05:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
put it towards another person that's
 
05:57:54.468 --> 05:57:54.478 align:start position:0%
giving Direct Services to their child
 
05:57:57.390 --> 05:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
instead of paying me to try to assert
 
05:58:00.270 --> 05:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
their right under the law I mean that is
 
05:58:02.590 --> 05:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
that is not an unusual conversation for
 
05:58:04.830 --> 05:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
me to have with
 
05:58:08.670 --> 05:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
clients one follow what you just said so
 
05:58:10.910 --> 05:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
a parent goes through the IEP process
 
05:58:12.830 --> 05:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
working in the IEP and nothing gets
 
05:58:15.430 --> 05:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
resolved there they go to mediation
 
05:58:17.868 --> 05:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
nothing's resolved there how long does
 
05:58:20.670 --> 05:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
the due process take to get that
 
05:58:22.390 --> 05:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
concluded and what happens to the
 
05:58:25.670 --> 05:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
student in the room so it's um it's
 
05:58:28.430 --> 05:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be conclud uh concluded very
 
05:58:30.788 --> 05:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
quickly sometimes it does get continued
 
05:58:33.910 --> 05:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
but that's only by um by agreement so
 
05:58:36.468 --> 05:58:36.478 align:start position:0%
that's not that's typically not a
 
05:58:39.150 --> 05:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
problem sometimes things happen with
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
people's schedules and you know and that
 
05:58:46.468 --> 05:58:46.478 align:start position:0%
that does happen but if a child is in a
 
05:58:49.390 --> 05:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
situation where there really needs to be
 
05:58:52.468 --> 05:58:52.478 align:start position:0%
um an um you know a decision made
 
05:58:54.430 --> 05:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
quickly then it needs to be made within
 
05:58:58.070 --> 05:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
30 days and then the hearing officer H
 
05:59:00.190 --> 05:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have all the D Times
 
05:59:01.990 --> 05:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
Really committed to memory the days
 
05:59:03.510 --> 05:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
because every State's a little different
 
05:59:06.990 --> 05:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
but um it has to be very quickly you
 
05:59:09.030 --> 05:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
know has to be very quick turnaround so
 
05:59:12.468 --> 05:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
that's that part is fine thank you very
 
05:59:14.030 --> 05:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
much are there any further questions
 
05:59:17.948 --> 05:59:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:20.868 --> 05:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
Stevens repres you have your hand up yes
 
05:59:22.230 --> 05:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
sir yes Mr
 
05:59:24.270 --> 05:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:59:26.628 --> 05:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
05:59:29.390 --> 05:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
um seems from what I'm hearing that a
 
05:59:32.350 --> 05:59:32.360 align:start position:0%
lot of this is b a lot of the concern
 
05:59:36.788 --> 05:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
here um is based on and probably fairly
 
05:59:40.390 --> 05:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
so on unequal economic
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
resources so District resources versus a
 
05:59:43.760 --> 05:59:45.030 align:start position:0%
resources so District resources versus a
families

05:59:45.030 --> 05:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
families
 
05:59:50.310 --> 05:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
resources um and an unequal uh perhaps
 
05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity or uh ability or the time to
 
05:59:58.270 --> 05:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
master and gain sort of control over uh
 
06:00:01.750 --> 06:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
large amounts of both data uh but also
 
06:00:03.750 --> 06:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
as you said the parents the friendly
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
guide for parents that's well over 200
 
06:00:09.350 --> 06:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
pages long so given all of that I'm
 
06:00:11.070 --> 06:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
still at I'm still trying to figure out
 
06:00:14.590 --> 06:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
how does changing the burden solve those
 
06:00:18.390 --> 06:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
things so it it just
 
06:00:21.708 --> 06:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
will we go into
 
06:00:26.190 --> 06:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
um we go into a hearing with the
 
06:00:29.708 --> 06:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
school having to um not just poke holes
 
06:00:33.628 --> 06:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
in our case and say you didn't prove it
 
06:00:35.788 --> 06:00:35.798 align:start position:0%
and so again it's like the you know if
 
06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's the the even like you just um they
 
06:00:43.830 --> 06:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
ha they have to prove they have to have
 
06:00:46.788 --> 06:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
that that heavier piece of the of the
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
scales than than we do so it
 
06:00:56.670 --> 06:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
um it's a hearing officer can say well
 
06:00:59.430 --> 06:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
parents I here you know yes you you've
 
06:01:00.990 --> 06:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
established this this and this but you
 
06:01:03.868 --> 06:01:03.878 align:start position:0%
didn't prove that it's at that level so
 
06:01:07.110 --> 06:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a hurdle I keep using
 
06:01:08.468 --> 06:01:08.478 align:start position:0%
that word hurdle but that's what it
 
06:01:10.230 --> 06:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
feels like you know it's like a
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
something you have to overcome at the
 
06:01:16.708 --> 06:01:16.718 align:start position:0%
hearing and so it does um it just helps
 
06:01:18.270 --> 06:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
to level the playing field it doesn't
 
06:01:20.270 --> 06:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
change who has access to the information
 
06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
and so forth but it just makes it more
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:31.830 --> 06:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing that that just I guess
 
06:01:34.670 --> 06:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
is still uh a little Troublesome to me
 
06:01:36.150 --> 06:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
maybe uh and I don't know I don't know
 
06:01:39.708 --> 06:01:39.718 align:start position:0%
where I stand on this but um you know
 
06:01:41.628 --> 06:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
normally in our system I believe you
 
06:01:44.548 --> 06:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
know the idea is that this is what at
 
06:01:47.190 --> 06:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
least what I've been taught um is that
 
06:01:49.390 --> 06:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
you're innocent until proven
 
06:01:52.350 --> 06:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
guilty but in this case it would be kind
 
06:01:54.190 --> 06:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
of the district is guilty unless they
 
06:01:56.350 --> 06:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
can prove they're
 
06:01:56.360 --> 06:01:58.390 align:start position:0%
can prove they're
innocent

06:01:58.390 --> 06:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
innocent
 
06:02:00.830 --> 06:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
like if you're it's more like that you
 
06:02:04.708 --> 06:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
know the state has the OB has the burden
 
06:02:07.190 --> 06:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
of proof and a criminal matter because
 
06:02:10.150 --> 06:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's the state to prove that
 
06:02:12.510 --> 06:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
and you know obviously the the burden of
 
06:02:14.070 --> 06:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
proof is higher it's beyond a reasonable
 
06:02:17.430 --> 06:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
doubt in a criminal matter but it's
 
06:02:17.440 --> 06:02:19.430 align:start position:0%
doubt in a criminal matter but it's
um

06:02:19.430 --> 06:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:27.468 --> 06:02:27.478 align:start position:0%
it's who who has the the access um to
 
06:02:28.990 --> 06:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
the information the evidence the
 
06:02:31.150 --> 06:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
witnesses and all of that you know and
 
06:02:32.990 --> 06:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's really so the whole idea you have
 
06:02:35.948 --> 06:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
to get back to the purpose of idea you
 
06:02:38.948 --> 06:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
know it's it really isn't supposed to be
 
06:02:41.670 --> 06:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
this this uh
 
06:02:43.990 --> 06:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
confrontational parent V
 
06:02:46.628 --> 06:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
school thing it's supposed to be and the
 
06:02:48.350 --> 06:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
department of Ed for the state is
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to be overseeing this it's
 
06:02:52.750 --> 06:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be that that that you know
 
06:02:54.628 --> 06:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
the kids have rights and that their
 
06:02:58.430 --> 06:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
rights are being protected and and um
 
06:03:00.150 --> 06:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
and so the school just comes in and said
 
06:03:01.548 --> 06:03:01.558 align:start position:0%
this is what we're doing and this is why
 
06:03:05.590 --> 06:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing it and this is um enough and
 
06:03:08.830 --> 06:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's um schools and
 
06:03:10.750 --> 06:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
superintendents and teachers have a lot
 
06:03:10.760 --> 06:03:12.430 align:start position:0%
superintendents and teachers have a lot
of

06:03:12.430 --> 06:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:03:15.150 --> 06:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
um you know trust from the hearing
 
06:03:17.390 --> 06:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
officers I'd say or whatever the right
 
06:03:19.190 --> 06:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
word is
 
06:03:22.390 --> 06:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
right I guess I I guess my concern or
 
06:03:24.030 --> 06:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
the thing that sort of sticks with me
 
06:03:26.030 --> 06:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
and even just following with what you
 
06:03:28.708 --> 06:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
just said if if if I'm suing the
 
06:03:30.750 --> 06:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
state because I believe the state is
 
06:03:34.910 --> 06:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
abridging my rights the burden lies with
 
06:03:39.548 --> 06:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
me but in this case it sounds like the
 
06:03:42.990 --> 06:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
burden the parent or whomever files is
 
06:03:47.070 --> 06:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
saying you are bridging my the child's
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
rights but the burden lies with the
 
06:03:53.390 --> 06:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
state or the district I'm sorry um the
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
burden lies with the state of the
 
06:03:56.590 --> 06:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
district in this case to say no actually
 
06:03:58.030 --> 06:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
06:04:01.350 --> 06:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
um so again it it seems I don't to me it
 
06:04:03.468 --> 06:04:03.478 align:start position:0%
just seems to reverse uh what is the
 
06:04:06.030 --> 06:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
norm I'm not saying that that's that's
 
06:04:08.030 --> 06:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know problematic I'm just trying to
 
06:04:10.110 --> 06:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
get my head around this that's all well
 
06:04:12.150 --> 06:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
that's why you know the the Supreme
 
06:04:14.510 --> 06:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
Court defaulted to that and said you
 
06:04:17.070 --> 06:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
know we're it's the party bringing the
 
06:04:18.670 --> 06:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
action has the burden of proof so when
 
06:04:20.948 --> 06:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
the school district brings the due
 
06:04:22.548 --> 06:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
process they have the burden of proof
 
06:04:24.868 --> 06:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
but you just think of like even access
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
to you know access to evidence access to
 
06:04:31.708 --> 06:04:31.718 align:start position:0%
Witnesses it's it's a unique situation
 
06:04:35.788 --> 06:04:35.798 align:start position:0%
and it um because of what's involved um
 
06:04:39.868 --> 06:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
and who's involved it requires a unique
 
06:04:43.070 --> 06:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
approach my opinion okay thank you thank
 
06:04:45.150 --> 06:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much uh
 
06:04:45.160 --> 06:04:46.868 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you very much uh
represent

06:04:46.868 --> 06:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
06:04:51.910 --> 06:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Miss Stevens
 
06:04:55.708 --> 06:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
um I would ass is am I making a correct
 
06:04:59.110 --> 06:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
assumption that the cases that go to Due
 
06:05:03.310 --> 06:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
Process are are not just over a tutor or
 
06:05:07.830 --> 06:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
um you know minor thing in the IEP that
 
06:05:09.708 --> 06:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
when it goes to Due Process the stakes
 
06:05:10.868 --> 06:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
are pretty
 
06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
high sometimes
 
06:05:16.868 --> 06:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it involves you know like
 
06:05:18.910 --> 06:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
private like placement at a private
 
06:05:21.230 --> 06:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
school you know special purpose private
 
06:05:24.628 --> 06:05:24.638 align:start position:0%
school but sometimes
 
06:05:28.990 --> 06:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
it's um but yeah you know has to be cost
 
06:05:31.948 --> 06:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
efficient I guess for both parties so
 
06:05:34.670 --> 06:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
the so the mediation is because I know a
 
06:05:38.110 --> 06:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
lot of schools have been trying to um
 
06:05:41.628 --> 06:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
you know beef up for lack of better
 
06:05:44.430 --> 06:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
words they're inhouse special education
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
services right right and providers in
 
06:05:49.548 --> 06:05:49.558 align:start position:0%
order to keep the child in the least
 
06:05:51.390 --> 06:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment and also to keep
 
06:05:54.750 --> 06:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
them within District um is this where a
 
06:05:58.070 --> 06:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
lot of the due process problems come
 
06:06:01.468 --> 06:06:01.478 align:start position:0%
arise well you know certainly some but
 
06:06:04.070 --> 06:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
not not all sometimes it's just you know
 
06:06:07.110 --> 06:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
in in my professional opinion it's when
 
06:06:10.230 --> 06:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's um a disconnect between the
 
06:06:13.708 --> 06:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
parents understanding of their child's
 
06:06:15.868 --> 06:06:15.878 align:start position:0%
disability and needs and the school's
 
06:06:18.590 --> 06:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
understanding of the of the needs and
 
06:06:20.750 --> 06:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
then I think schools have to make
 
06:06:24.510 --> 06:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
decisions they um based on budgets even
 
06:06:25.910 --> 06:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
though that's not supposed to be part of
 
06:06:27.590 --> 06:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
it that's the reality you know and you
 
06:06:29.948 --> 06:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
can't blame them but that's the reality
 
06:06:34.590 --> 06:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
but um often it's just when parents and
 
06:06:36.868 --> 06:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
then when parents are really advocating
 
06:06:40.110 --> 06:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
strongly sometimes school districts just
 
06:06:42.708 --> 06:06:42.718 align:start position:0%
they they just won't listen to them I
 
06:06:45.070 --> 06:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
mean that's the reality and you know I
 
06:06:46.548 --> 06:06:46.558 align:start position:0%
know we all support schools and
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
everything but that is the reality of it
 
06:06:52.750 --> 06:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
happens thank you thank you thank you
 
06:06:55.030 --> 06:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
very much rep Woodcock do you have a
 
06:06:57.670 --> 06:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
question just one thank you Mr chairman
 
06:06:59.270 --> 06:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
P Stevens thank you for taking my
 
06:07:01.708 --> 06:07:01.718 align:start position:0%
question and I feel like representative
 
06:07:04.590 --> 06:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
Le I'm sort of have time hard time
 
06:07:06.070 --> 06:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
getting head on
 
06:07:09.030 --> 06:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
this in in your practice in this
 
06:07:12.430 --> 06:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
particular type of a
 
06:07:15.110 --> 06:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
case can you give me a ballpark on
 
06:07:18.190 --> 06:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
percentage where the where the uh
 
06:07:21.430 --> 06:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
results not typically land uh the parent
 
06:07:24.190 --> 06:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
wins 70% of the time 30% of the time
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
schools 602 just where is that distrib
 
06:07:29.948 --> 06:07:29.958 align:start position:0%
ution just ballpark if you may I think
 
06:07:32.510 --> 06:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
um schools generally win when it goes to
 
06:07:36.670 --> 06:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and schools if they will settle
 
06:07:40.390 --> 06:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
if they think that they're going to lose
 
06:07:44.430 --> 06:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah no I think that um parents lose
 
06:07:45.910 --> 06:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
more than they win when it goes to
 
06:07:48.708 --> 06:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
hearing my experience it's absolutely
 
06:07:51.310 --> 06:07:51.320 align:start position:0%
true okay thank you thank you attorney
 
06:07:53.948 --> 06:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you very
 
06:07:57.110 --> 06:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
much uh M St are there further questions
 
06:08:01.590 --> 06:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:05.788 --> 06:08:05.798 align:start position:0%
Stevens go ahead thank you she very much
 
06:08:07.430 --> 06:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
I was just gonna say Thank you Mr chair
 
06:08:09.910 --> 06:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me I thought you
 
06:08:10.670 --> 06:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
ask yourself a
 
06:08:10.680 --> 06:08:11.750 align:start position:0%
ask yourself a
[Music]

06:08:11.750 --> 06:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:08:16.590 --> 06:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much okay so
 
06:08:21.468 --> 06:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
um Mora Ryan has joined
 
06:08:25.590 --> 06:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
yep go ahead Miss Ryan can you hear

me okay thank you just checking if you
 
06:08:29.510 --> 06:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
hear a lot of wind it's because it's
 
06:08:31.270 --> 06:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
very windy and hopefully hopefully my
 
06:08:32.750 --> 06:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
house will not blow
 
06:08:35.670 --> 06:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
away um my name is Mora Ryan and I'm
 
06:08:38.230 --> 06:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
here to speak to you regarding HB
 
06:08:41.110 --> 06:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
581 um I am a member of the sock
 
06:08:43.788 --> 06:08:43.798 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm also the head of a
 
06:08:47.070 --> 06:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
parent advocacy group um and I am here
 
06:08:48.628 --> 06:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
speaking as a private individual and a
 
06:08:51.548 --> 06:08:51.558 align:start position:0%
person who has gone through due process
 
06:08:54.708 --> 06:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
personally um HB 581 would shift the
 
06:08:56.150 --> 06:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
burden of proof from parents to schools
 
06:08:58.350 --> 06:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
and do class hearings this bill is
 
06:08:59.708 --> 06:08:59.718 align:start position:0%
critically important to students with
 
06:09:01.030 --> 06:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities who are struggling to
 
06:09:03.350 --> 06:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
access an appropriate appropriate
 
06:09:05.628 --> 06:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
education as a parent I've Had The
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
Misfortune to go through facilitated IEP
 
06:09:10.430 --> 06:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
meetings State complaints mediation and
 
06:09:12.590 --> 06:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
due process these processes are
 
06:09:14.868 --> 06:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
inherently biased and unfair here are
 
06:09:17.510 --> 06:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons why facilitated IEP
 
06:09:19.468 --> 06:09:19.478 align:start position:0%
meetings don't involve a facilitator who
 
06:09:21.868 --> 06:09:21.878 align:start position:0%
guides the conversation to move forward
 
06:09:24.070 --> 06:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
as a result the facilitator will repeat
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
what each person has said which is not
 
06:09:28.270 --> 06:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
productive in state complaints the
 
06:09:30.190 --> 06:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
parent as the filer is required to
 
06:09:31.628 --> 06:09:31.638 align:start position:0%
submit everything that they send to the
 
06:09:33.708 --> 06:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
investigator to the school as well but
 
06:09:35.430 --> 06:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
the school is not required to send their
 
06:09:37.350 --> 06:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
information to the parent who is given
 
06:09:39.910 --> 06:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
no opportunity to refute or present
 
06:09:43.070 --> 06:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
additional evidence to address that um
 
06:09:44.468 --> 06:09:44.478 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with due process that
 
06:09:46.030 --> 06:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of due process that
 
06:09:47.190 --> 06:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
would not be something that would be
 
06:09:49.548 --> 06:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
acceptable in a court of law um in
 
06:09:51.030 --> 06:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
addition school districts have the use
 
06:09:53.628 --> 06:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
of attorneys whereas parents do not last
 
06:09:55.868 --> 06:09:55.878 align:start position:0%
there's due process due process is an
 
06:09:58.868 --> 06:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
unfair bias and one-sided system why
 
06:10:00.708 --> 06:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
school districts have access to all of
 
06:10:02.430 --> 06:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
the students records and can observe the
 
06:10:04.430 --> 06:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
student in the school parents have been
 
06:10:06.150 --> 06:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
denied the ability to conduct
 
06:10:07.948 --> 06:10:07.958 align:start position:0%
observations within with their own
 
06:10:09.670 --> 06:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
evaluators even though they have that
 
06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
right by law I have a parent who's
 
06:10:13.670 --> 06:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
preparing to file for due process right
 
06:10:15.788 --> 06:10:15.798 align:start position:0%
now she requested a complete set of
 
06:10:17.830 --> 06:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
records for her child she received
 
06:10:19.990 --> 06:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 40 pages for the students
 
06:10:23.390 --> 06:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
10 plus years in school there's no way
 
06:10:26.350 --> 06:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
these records are that limited in my due
 
06:10:27.948 --> 06:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
process say the school turned over no
 
06:10:29.750 --> 06:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
current records and special education
 
06:10:31.948 --> 06:10:31.958 align:start position:0%
records that were over 3 years old if
 
06:10:33.670 --> 06:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with due process you can
 
06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
only go back two years so I did not
 
06:10:37.868 --> 06:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
receive any records that would assist me
 
06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
with my due process claim exhibits are
 
06:10:42.270 --> 06:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
exchanged five days prior to due process
 
06:10:43.910 --> 06:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
and if the school has put in an exhibit
 
06:10:45.310 --> 06:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
that the parent wants to challenge with
 
06:10:47.548 --> 06:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
new evidence it is virtually impossible
 
06:10:50.350 --> 06:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
to get it entered into the record in my
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
D process we were not able to get any
 
06:10:54.430 --> 06:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
Discovery or use any exits and had to
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
rely completely on what the school gave
 
06:10:56.400 --> 06:10:57.350 align:start position:0%
rely completely on what the school gave
us

06:10:57.350 --> 06:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:10:59.670 --> 06:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
they started they they slanted things
 
06:11:01.390 --> 06:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
from the records and they misinterpreted
 
06:11:03.708 --> 06:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
them to suit their purposes I was not
 
06:11:05.948 --> 06:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
permitted to hear all of the testimony
 
06:11:07.750 --> 06:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
that the school district gave but the
 
06:11:10.190 --> 06:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
school Lea was able to hear all I I was
 
06:11:11.590 --> 06:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
not permitted to hear all the testimony
 
06:11:14.430 --> 06:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
that was rendered but was able to hear
 
06:11:16.788 --> 06:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
all my testimony plus all of her
 
06:11:19.708 --> 06:11:19.718 align:start position:0%
employees testimony in addition the
 
06:11:22.670 --> 06:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
testimony of the of two witnesses went
 
06:11:25.150 --> 06:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
missing the evaluator and the classroom
 
06:11:26.750 --> 06:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
teacher and were never entered into into
 
06:11:28.310 --> 06:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
the record rendering the record
 
06:11:30.788 --> 06:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
inaccurate I had an expert evaluator who
 
06:11:32.270 --> 06:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
taught at Harvard Medical School and did
 
06:11:33.948 --> 06:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
specialty residencies in Columbia who
 
06:11:36.230 --> 06:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
was an expert in autism the school had
 
06:11:37.628 --> 06:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
an evaluator who had an eight-month
 
06:11:39.670 --> 06:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
Masters that she got at Rivier College
 
06:11:41.510 --> 06:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
had no medical training was not a
 
06:11:43.548 --> 06:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
specialist in autism and could not
 
06:11:45.030 --> 06:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
understand the statistical relevance of
 
06:11:47.070 --> 06:11:47.080 align:start position:0%
the outcomes of her own
 
06:11:49.310 --> 06:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
testing because my witness was not
 
06:11:51.070 --> 06:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
granted access to observe my son in
 
06:11:53.150 --> 06:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
school more weight was placed on the
 
06:11:55.830 --> 06:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
less qualified evaluator the situation
 
06:11:58.030 --> 06:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
was frustrating to say the least there
 
06:12:00.990 --> 06:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
were no proo the as far as attorneys go
 
06:12:03.070 --> 06:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
there were no proor options available to
 
06:12:05.628 --> 06:12:05.638 align:start position:0%
me as a disabled veteran I'm on a fixed
 
06:12:07.390 --> 06:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
income but I still had to pay thousands
 
06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
and thousands of dollars which were
 
06:12:10.990 --> 06:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
nothing to the district many districts
 
06:12:12.990 --> 06:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
carry primx liability insurance which
 
06:12:14.750 --> 06:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
covers their due process expenses and
 
06:12:16.990 --> 06:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have to pay anything and
 
06:12:19.150 --> 06:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
while my costs were equivalent to the
 
06:12:21.390 --> 06:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
price of a small automobile what the
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
district spent was not even a rounding
 
06:12:25.030 --> 06:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
error in their budget disadvantaged
 
06:12:28.030 --> 06:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
groups like some others income
 
06:12:30.310 --> 06:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
families minorities and English as a
 
06:12:32.070 --> 06:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
second language Learners have no real
 
06:12:37.390 --> 06:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
claim as a result of lack of viable educ
 
06:12:42.750 --> 06:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
our DEA says we must act in the best
 
06:12:44.190 --> 06:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
interest of the child at all times that
 
06:12:46.628 --> 06:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
includes the school is that happening if
 
06:12:48.270 --> 06:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
these children are being left unable to
 
06:12:50.750 --> 06:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
care for them themselves once they leave
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
school because the school controlled the
 
06:12:55.350 --> 06:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
information had unlimited funds and did
 
06:12:56.990 --> 06:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
not have to prove
 
06:12:58.910 --> 06:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
the de sacked against me and that was
 
06:13:00.948 --> 06:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
only the beginning of the problems my
 
06:13:03.070 --> 06:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
child is high functioning autistic
 
06:13:04.670 --> 06:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
because of this the school feels that my
 
06:13:07.110 --> 06:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
child is less deserving of help the
 
06:13:09.070 --> 06:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
school district in their brief stated
 
06:13:10.628 --> 06:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
that they were only required to give a
 
06:13:13.190 --> 06:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
bare minimum benefit this is the rally
 
06:13:15.310 --> 06:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
standard which has long been overturned
 
06:13:18.150 --> 06:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
by the inur F standard um from the
 
06:13:20.468 --> 06:13:20.478 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court furthermore the district
 
06:13:22.230 --> 06:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
failed to provide progress reports or
 
06:13:24.070 --> 06:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
provide all the services and alter
 
06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
different aspects of service delivery to
 
06:13:27.510 --> 06:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
minimize the the cost therefore
 
06:13:28.990 --> 06:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
diminishing the effectiveness of the
 
06:13:32.590 --> 06:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
service Services now in grade 11 my
 
06:13:34.190 --> 06:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
child can only write on a fifth grade
 
06:13:36.910 --> 06:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
level cannot Advocate and has difficulty
 
06:13:38.628 --> 06:13:38.638 align:start position:0%
navigating remote learning and it has
 
06:13:40.350 --> 06:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
lost almost two years of instruction
 
06:13:42.510 --> 06:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
which will impact both higher education
 
06:13:44.070 --> 06:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
which is no longer a
 
06:13:46.670 --> 06:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
possibility this will Al also limit
 
06:13:49.750 --> 06:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
employment options as a junior my
 
06:13:52.390 --> 06:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
child's counselor helping figure out
 
06:13:54.670 --> 06:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
what my child can do after school but
 
06:13:56.468 --> 06:13:56.478 align:start position:0%
school has given up on him and devalues
 
06:13:59.030 --> 06:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
existence in the world my child will not
 
06:14:01.070 --> 06:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
be able to attain gainful employment or
 
06:14:02.708 --> 06:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
live independently despite the fact that
 
06:14:06.390 --> 06:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
he has an IQ of 160 children with IEPs
 
06:14:08.150 --> 06:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
make up roughly 20% of Any Given
 
06:14:10.150 --> 06:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
graduating class but they don't have the
 
06:14:11.468 --> 06:14:11.478 align:start position:0%
same access to the curriculum as they're
 
06:14:13.708 --> 06:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
non- disabled peers this becomes very
 
06:14:15.230 --> 06:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
clear when you look at the proficiency
 
06:14:17.788 --> 06:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
data for children with IEP Statewide
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
only 14% are proficient in math and 17%
 
06:14:22.708 --> 06:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
are proficient in reading this leaves
 
06:14:23.990 --> 06:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
very little chance for independent
 
06:14:26.310 --> 06:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
living or self-sufficiency if we as a
 
06:14:28.030 --> 06:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
the state continue to allow such a large
 
06:14:29.390 --> 06:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
portion of our graduating high school
 
06:14:31.430 --> 06:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
classes to be unemployable it's
 
06:14:33.990 --> 06:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
unsustainable to keep our state solvent
 
06:14:35.548 --> 06:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
the state will spend Millions supporting
 
06:14:36.830 --> 06:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
kids who with the proper training and
 
06:14:38.468 --> 06:14:38.478 align:start position:0%
services could have been independent
 
06:14:41.190 --> 06:14:41.200 align:start position:0%
taxpaying members of our society it's
 
06:14:43.548 --> 06:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
also unfair to kids many low-income kids
 
06:14:47.430 --> 06:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
join the Army that's Ryan um need to
 
06:14:50.788 --> 06:14:50.798 align:start position:0%
speak to the bill um and I think you're
 
06:14:52.548 --> 06:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
starting to lose some of the folks here
 
06:14:55.310 --> 06:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
just uh moving very quickly and trying
 
06:14:57.788 --> 06:14:57.798 align:start position:0%
to get a lot done and we're we're we're
 
06:15:00.070 --> 06:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
not really addressing specific language
 
06:15:01.948 --> 06:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
within this bill which we need to have
 
06:15:04.430 --> 06:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
you address thank
 
06:15:09.628 --> 06:15:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:11.910 --> 06:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
as the school
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
districts left to their own devices will
 
06:15:16.190 --> 06:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
favor educational options that enable
 
06:15:19.070 --> 06:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
them to conserve resources um many
 
06:15:21.030 --> 06:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
school districts deny a few thousand
 
06:15:22.750 --> 06:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
worth of services off of making this
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
decision on the basis of staff and
 
06:15:26.190 --> 06:15:26.200 align:start position:0%
funding and not on what the child needs
 
06:15:27.548 --> 06:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
in my case the district was denying
 
06:15:30.030 --> 06:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
$7,000 worth of services over four years
 
06:15:31.030 --> 06:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
which was less than the amount of
 
06:15:31.990 --> 06:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
funding that they received from the
 
06:15:33.670 --> 06:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
federal government and if you actually
 
06:15:36.548 --> 06:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
look at the court case um deal which is
 
06:15:38.948 --> 06:15:38.958 align:start position:0%
also cited um and will be in my written
 
06:15:40.910 --> 06:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
testimony the school district spent $2
 
06:15:44.468 --> 06:15:44.478 align:start position:0%
million in legal fees um over a few
 
06:15:47.230 --> 06:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of services as well um
 
06:15:49.270 --> 06:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
Ida encourages collaboration and
 
06:15:50.830 --> 06:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
creative thinking between the parent and
 
06:15:52.468 --> 06:15:52.478 align:start position:0%
the school district to attain solutions
 
06:15:55.070 --> 06:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
that will benefit the child to try and
 
06:15:57.510 --> 06:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
reach some level of bance Ida discarded
 
06:15:59.110 --> 06:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
or disallows schools bringing an
 
06:16:00.910 --> 06:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
attorney to meeting un the parent brings
 
06:16:03.430 --> 06:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
one first but this is not the reality as
 
06:16:05.150 --> 06:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
districts have begun bringing in lawyers
 
06:16:08.030 --> 06:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
before the IEP team meeting has ever
 
06:16:11.110 --> 06:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
occurred um Justice Ginsburg noted that
 
06:16:12.510 --> 06:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
if a school district not have the burden
 
06:16:14.750 --> 06:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
of proof the district is unlikely to
 
06:16:16.948 --> 06:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
reach a consensus with the parent about
 
06:16:16.958 --> 06:16:17.830 align:start position:0%
reach a consensus with the parent about
an

06:16:17.830 --> 06:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
an
 
06:16:20.590 --> 06:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
IEP the decision on the schaer v's case
 
06:16:21.990 --> 06:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
was attained because the parent state
 
06:16:23.910 --> 06:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
Maryland did not have a state law
 
06:16:25.708 --> 06:16:25.718 align:start position:0%
regarding who should um have the burden
 
06:16:27.788 --> 06:16:27.798 align:start position:0%
of proof Pro the default position was
 
06:16:29.070 --> 06:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
that the person bringing the action
 
06:16:30.910 --> 06:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
should have that Duty therefore there
 
06:16:33.070 --> 06:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
are some states which have that law in
 
06:16:37.230 --> 06:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
place um Alaska Alabama Connecticut DC
 
06:16:39.830 --> 06:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
Delaware Georgia Illinois Kentucky
 
06:16:42.548 --> 06:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
Minnesota West Virginia New York New
 
06:16:45.548 --> 06:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
Jersey Delaware and Georgia we're we are
 
06:16:47.230 --> 06:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
here today because we're asking for
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
children to become inde independent and
 
06:16:51.150 --> 06:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
educated we want them to have aimful
 
06:16:52.948 --> 06:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
employment and to be active participants
 
06:16:55.590 --> 06:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
in society this law is not new and did
 
06:16:57.670 --> 06:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
not negatively impact the number of due
 
06:17:00.150 --> 06:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
processes filed um if anything these
 
06:17:02.628 --> 06:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
states um experienced a decrease in due
 
06:17:04.270 --> 06:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
process filings after this law was
 
06:17:06.270 --> 06:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
passed part of the reason was if you
 
06:17:09.468 --> 06:17:09.478 align:start position:0%
look at the Cadre website they um they
 
06:17:11.628 --> 06:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
track these states and they look at
 
06:17:14.868 --> 06:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
their D Miss Ryan I think you've gone
 
06:17:17.230 --> 06:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
well beyond the time that you know
 
06:17:19.548 --> 06:17:19.558 align:start position:0%
you're allocated you need to wrap this
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:27.190 --> 06:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
please hearing officers are actually
 
06:17:28.708 --> 06:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
trained by the school district attorneys
 
06:17:30.350 --> 06:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
and have personal relationships with
 
06:17:32.110 --> 06:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
them I don't believe any parent would
 
06:17:33.670 --> 06:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
bring a frivolous lawsuit because it's
 
06:17:35.750 --> 06:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
just such a nightmare and I think that
 
06:17:37.030 --> 06:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
with the schools bringing a more
 
06:17:39.670 --> 06:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
in-house special education they don't
 
06:17:41.270 --> 06:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
take into consideration the needs of the
 
06:17:45.310 --> 06:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
individual child um I support 581 I
 
06:17:48.110 --> 06:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary and I ask that you
 
06:17:50.570 --> 06:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of it thank
 
06:17:50.580 --> 06:17:54.910 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of it thank

a disability who is an adult now and I

am also have worked in the special ed
 
06:19:06.628 --> 06:19:06.638 align:start position:0%
setting as a special education teacher
 
06:19:09.750 --> 06:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
and residential and private school and I
 
06:19:12.750 --> 06:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
currently uh am working as an advocate
 
06:19:15.910 --> 06:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
for parents and I I appreciate your time
 
06:19:17.830 --> 06:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to take up much of it I
 
06:19:19.948 --> 06:19:19.958 align:start position:0%
just wanted to speak on behalf of the
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
parents that I have worked with over the
 
06:19:22.320 --> 06:19:23.270 align:start position:0%
parents that I have worked with over the
many

06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
many
 
06:19:25.868 --> 06:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
years that I have been practicing in
 
06:19:29.190 --> 06:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
special education and on their behalf um
 
06:19:34.150 --> 06:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
I totally support um HB 581 based on my
 
06:19:38.070 --> 06:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
experiences in and out of uh the public
 
06:19:41.868 --> 06:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
school setting I've had wonderful
 
06:19:43.670 --> 06:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
experiences working with some very
 
06:19:46.708 --> 06:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
dedicated administrators and Educators
 
06:19:48.270 --> 06:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
but I have a unique position where I
 
06:19:51.310 --> 06:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
have been able to see also what happens
 
06:19:54.510 --> 06:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors and it's not always
 
06:19:56.948 --> 06:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
great like any session there are people
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
who are wonderful at their jobs and
 
06:20:02.868 --> 06:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
dedicated and some that are not and this
 
06:20:07.788 --> 06:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately does often come out um as
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
you move up the line between parent and
 
06:20:13.270 --> 06:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
schools with um some disagreements
 
06:20:13.280 --> 06:20:15.310 align:start position:0%
schools with um some disagreements
and

06:20:15.310 --> 06:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:20:18.310 --> 06:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately my experience with
 
06:20:21.430 --> 06:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
parents there's not it's not fair for
 
06:20:23.430 --> 06:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
them to be
 
06:20:27.070 --> 06:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
expected to be able to to provide the
 
06:20:29.708 --> 06:20:29.718 align:start position:0%
amount of information that's required
 
06:20:33.948 --> 06:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
and the time that's needed to defend the
 
06:20:35.190 --> 06:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
rights of their child that they're
 
06:20:38.350 --> 06:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
already entitled to they're living their
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
lives as we are day in day out raising
 
06:20:44.750 --> 06:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
children who may have disabilities they
 
06:20:47.868 --> 06:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
are not employed full-time to be dealing
 
06:20:50.150 --> 06:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
with this they may also already have a
 
06:20:52.750 --> 06:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
full-time job outside of their home the
 
06:20:55.910 --> 06:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
school districts employ people to do
 
06:20:58.468 --> 06:20:58.478 align:start position:0%
this they are the experts they are the
 
06:21:00.990 --> 06:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
ones that the hearing officers look to
 
06:21:04.110 --> 06:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
for expert testimony they are the ones
 
06:21:07.350 --> 06:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
who oftentimes will tell parents while
 
06:21:10.310 --> 06:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're sitting across the table that they
 
06:21:13.150 --> 06:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
know more than the parent
 
06:21:16.390 --> 06:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
does after an enormous amount of time of
 
06:21:18.990 --> 06:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
going back and forth lengthy periods
 
06:21:21.910 --> 06:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
time lots of hours and still not being
 
06:21:24.750 --> 06:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
able to come to the conclusion that
 
06:21:27.030 --> 06:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
works for the child and that the child
 
06:21:29.390 --> 06:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
is entitled to you have different
 
06:21:31.628 --> 06:21:31.638 align:start position:0%
options and when you work through all of
 
06:21:33.468 --> 06:21:33.478 align:start position:0%
those and come to doe process you've
 
06:21:36.670 --> 06:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
already spent a lot of money as a parent
 
06:21:38.230 --> 06:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
and many parents
 
06:21:40.910 --> 06:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
don't have children thinking they're
 
06:21:44.030 --> 06:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
going to need a fund of 30 to $50,000
 
06:21:47.270 --> 06:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
set aside in their budget to be able to
 
06:21:49.468 --> 06:21:49.478 align:start position:0%
defend the rights of their child to get
 
06:21:53.468 --> 06:21:53.478 align:start position:0%
a free and public education um school
 
06:21:56.230 --> 06:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
districts already have this money set
 
06:21:59.788 --> 06:21:59.798 align:start position:0%
aside they have lawyers on staff who are
 
06:22:03.070 --> 06:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
already doing this and I I think there's
 
06:22:05.628 --> 06:22:05.638 align:start position:0%
a misconception that if a school were to
 
06:22:09.150 --> 06:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
lose which they often don't um due to
 
06:22:12.708 --> 06:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
the enormous amount of resources they
 
06:22:16.868 --> 06:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
have um they often it seems to me that
 
06:22:18.030 --> 06:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
people have
 
06:22:22.230 --> 06:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
this perception that the school is
 
06:22:24.390 --> 06:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
taking funds
 
06:22:27.468 --> 06:22:27.478 align:start position:0%
from uh um areas that affect students
 
06:22:29.788 --> 06:22:29.798 align:start position:0%
this isn't the case and I'm not going to
 
06:22:31.350 --> 06:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
take up everyone's time trying to
 
06:22:33.750 --> 06:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
explain where this money comes from it's
 
06:22:35.750 --> 06:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted there's insurance if the
 
06:22:38.110 --> 06:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
district loses it comes from that if the
 
06:22:40.708 --> 06:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
parent loses it's coming from their
 
06:22:44.030 --> 06:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
paycheck and it's a lot of money
 
06:22:48.670 --> 06:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
um I have seen years go by where there's
 
06:22:51.628 --> 06:22:51.638 align:start position:0%
no progress and parents are still paying
 
06:22:54.510 --> 06:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
to try and get what we all want for our
 
06:22:54.520 --> 06:22:56.548 align:start position:0%
to try and get what we all want for our
children

06:22:56.548 --> 06:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
um like I said I I appreciate time I
 
06:23:01.430 --> 06:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to take a lot of it up I just
 
06:23:05.230 --> 06:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
would like to support all the parents
 
06:23:08.948 --> 06:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
and all the students who really need to
 
06:23:11.548 --> 06:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
be heard and hope that you'll vote in
 
06:23:13.430 --> 06:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
favor of HB
 
06:23:16.788 --> 06:23:16.798 align:start position:0%

for this opportunity I do appreciate it
 
06:23:44.190 --> 06:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
I will try to keep it short I'm here as
 
06:23:45.830 --> 06:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Citizen and mother to
 
06:23:48.468 --> 06:23:48.478 align:start position:0%
four children three of those children
 
06:23:51.110 --> 06:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
have autism and other special needs I'm
 
06:23:53.510 --> 06:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
also here as an unofficial volunteer
 
06:23:55.948 --> 06:23:55.958 align:start position:0%
being a voice for other special needs
 
06:23:58.390 --> 06:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
families I've heard countless stories of
 
06:24:00.468 --> 06:24:00.478 align:start position:0%
parents simply needing a little support
 
06:24:02.788 --> 06:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
for their children to no avail due to
 
06:24:05.310 --> 06:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
this burdensome process such as the
 
06:24:08.430 --> 06:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
power uh Power align tree worker who
 
06:24:10.270 --> 06:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
trimmed the trees behind my house who
 
06:24:12.070 --> 06:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
shared that his autistic eighth grader
 
06:24:14.350 --> 06:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
could still not read because he had no
 
06:24:16.788 --> 06:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
ability to afford or figure out the
 
06:24:19.830 --> 06:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
unmanageable process our families in New
 
06:24:22.548 --> 06:24:22.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as in many other states have
 
06:24:24.190 --> 06:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
been dealing with many children with
 
06:24:27.310 --> 06:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
legitimately diagnosed medical issues
 
06:24:29.468 --> 06:24:29.478 align:start position:0%
that affect these children academically
 
06:24:30.990 --> 06:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
behaviorally developmentally and
 
06:24:33.310 --> 06:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
emotionally in the school environment
 
06:24:35.468 --> 06:24:35.478 align:start position:0%
I'll say it again their medical
 
06:24:37.510 --> 06:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis U the need for special
 
06:24:39.350 --> 06:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
education continues to grow and has
 
06:24:40.830 --> 06:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
turned into a living nightmare for most
 
06:24:43.070 --> 06:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
families in New Hampshire due to lack of
 
06:24:44.750 --> 06:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
resources and other things but I can
 
06:24:46.190 --> 06:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
tell you there's no such thing as a
 
06:24:48.430 --> 06:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
frivolous case in all of my encounters
 
06:24:50.548 --> 06:24:50.558 align:start position:0%
with the almost 2,000 parents from the
 
06:24:52.628 --> 06:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire autism group and several
 
06:24:55.310 --> 06:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
other groups that I helped manage out of
 
06:24:58.510 --> 06:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
voler State just due to the need these
 
06:24:59.910 --> 06:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
are families and children who are
 
06:25:02.190 --> 06:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to quote unquote fly under the
 
06:25:04.430 --> 06:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
radar and belong to families that try to
 
06:25:06.708 --> 06:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
obtain help and quickly learn that they
 
06:25:08.868 --> 06:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
cannot navigate the cumbersome and
 
06:25:11.150 --> 06:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
difficult process these are families and
 
06:25:13.350 --> 06:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
children who are largely from
 
06:25:15.750 --> 06:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
financially disadvantaged situations
 
06:25:17.910 --> 06:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
already having a child with special
 
06:25:19.990 --> 06:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
needs is demanding and expensive and
 
06:25:22.390 --> 06:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
there is not an option to not provide
 
06:25:24.390 --> 06:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
this type of help so many of us find a
 
06:25:26.910 --> 06:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
way to get get the help sacrificing our
 
06:25:28.708 --> 06:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
health and well-being in the process to
 
06:25:29.948 --> 06:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
survive the
 
06:25:32.230 --> 06:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
journey I'm here today as a mother who
 
06:25:34.468 --> 06:25:34.478 align:start position:0%
has lived the struggle so much so that
 
06:25:35.990 --> 06:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
it tore our family apart and that
 
06:25:37.548 --> 06:25:37.558 align:start position:0%
struggle began in Earnest when our
 
06:25:39.990 --> 06:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
children set foot in schools this is not
 
06:25:41.670 --> 06:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
to say that we've not been able to gain
 
06:25:43.430 --> 06:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
common ground with the folks who have
 
06:25:45.030 --> 06:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
gotten to know our family over the years
 
06:25:46.628 --> 06:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
we now have kids in third fourth and
 
06:25:48.830 --> 06:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
fifth grades after many years of
 
06:25:50.670 --> 06:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
struggling we were able to get some help
 
06:25:53.150 --> 06:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
some of that which is very good some a
 
06:25:55.270 --> 06:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
work in progress but the path we
 
06:25:57.868 --> 06:25:57.878 align:start position:0%
traveled is all too common leading to
 
06:26:00.230 --> 06:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
Broken financially strapped families
 
06:26:01.670 --> 06:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
struggling to hang on by their
 
06:26:04.310 --> 06:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
proverbial fingernails when my now
 
06:26:06.110 --> 06:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
severely ill child with an acquired
 
06:26:07.830 --> 06:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
medical condition and autism was in
 
06:26:10.670 --> 06:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
first grade he cried nightly while I
 
06:26:13.430 --> 06:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
begged for help he was not able to have
 
06:26:15.788 --> 06:26:15.798 align:start position:0%
anyone even check in with him while the
 
06:26:17.990 --> 06:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
head of the PTA had had a one-on-one PA
 
06:26:20.830 --> 06:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
up for her son due to anxiety my child
 
06:26:22.468 --> 06:26:22.478 align:start position:0%
then went through a series of spiraling
 
06:26:22.478 --> 06:26:23.510 align:start position:0%
then went through a series of spiraling
downward

06:26:23.510 --> 06:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
downward
 
06:26:26.110 --> 06:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
physically uh issues due to the massive
 
06:26:27.430 --> 06:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
amount of stress he encountered the
 
06:26:29.430 --> 06:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
following years with little to no help
 
06:26:31.070 --> 06:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
he's now gotten some response but
 
06:26:33.230 --> 06:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
without my ability to hire an attorney
 
06:26:34.788 --> 06:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
having just gotten out of a six-year
 
06:26:37.150 --> 06:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
complex divorce not of my choosing we
 
06:26:39.030 --> 06:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
are not going to get very far can you
 
06:26:40.510 --> 06:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
imagine being a parent going through
 
06:26:42.990 --> 06:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
this with one child at once working
 
06:26:44.510 --> 06:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
full-time dealing with the host of
 
06:26:46.310 --> 06:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
issues that child has to address outside
 
06:26:48.270 --> 06:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
of school and paying privately for
 
06:26:50.190 --> 06:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
things to make up for the lack of
 
06:26:53.190 --> 06:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
support what I'm here to say however is
 
06:26:55.468 --> 06:26:55.478 align:start position:0%
for any of us involved it does not need
 
06:26:57.270 --> 06:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
to be this painful and hard not for
 
06:26:59.510 --> 06:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
anyone not for the school administration
 
06:27:01.788 --> 06:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
which are usually stretched thin they
 
06:27:03.590 --> 06:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
are people that are they teachers and
 
06:27:04.948 --> 06:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
assistant principles they're playing
 
06:27:07.468 --> 06:27:07.478 align:start position:0%
multiple roles and the system has an
 
06:27:09.190 --> 06:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to work better
 
06:27:11.788 --> 06:27:11.798 align:start position:0%
together not using the legal system
 
06:27:13.708 --> 06:27:13.718 align:start position:0%
which is based on a system of opposition
 
06:27:15.910 --> 06:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
of one party to the other we're not
 
06:27:18.030 --> 06:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
talking about suing a school district
 
06:27:19.590 --> 06:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily we're talking about small
 
06:27:21.510 --> 06:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
matters that can be worked out for the
 
06:27:24.230 --> 06:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
most part as attorney Stevens mentioned
 
06:27:26.590 --> 06:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
earlier this same evidence is provided
 
06:27:29.510 --> 06:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
on both sides a huge difference however
 
06:27:31.868 --> 06:27:31.878 align:start position:0%
is that parents might as well not even
 
06:27:33.510 --> 06:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
try to present evidence or spend the
 
06:27:35.708 --> 06:27:35.718 align:start position:0%
money to get help because they lost
 
06:27:38.190 --> 06:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
before they even started most of us have
 
06:27:40.670 --> 06:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
been told we cannot even go to mediation
 
06:27:42.830 --> 06:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
unless we have an attorney this is a
 
06:27:45.190 --> 06:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
common request from educational
 
06:27:49.070 --> 06:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
Advocates as it stands today under idea
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
schools already only have to consider
 
06:27:54.708 --> 06:27:54.718 align:start position:0%
medical diagnosis like autism not just
 
06:27:56.990 --> 06:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
accept them and coupled with the way the
 
06:27:59.468 --> 06:27:59.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law is written now leaves
 
06:28:01.230 --> 06:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
typically financially stretched and
 
06:28:03.270 --> 06:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
lifeb burdened families with even more
 
06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
hardship I speak not just for me but for
 
06:28:07.708 --> 06:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
the many teachers and administrators who
 
06:28:09.948 --> 06:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
can't say a word but they know things
 
06:28:12.990 --> 06:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
need to change flipping the burden of
 
06:28:15.948 --> 06:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
proof makes sense both from a stretched
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
educational system perspective and also
 
06:28:21.390 --> 06:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
from a hardship to fam's perspective we
 
06:28:23.510 --> 06:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
need to encourage a more collaborative
 
06:28:25.468 --> 06:28:25.478 align:start position:0%
process these matter matters are not
 
06:28:27.468 --> 06:28:27.478 align:start position:0%
frivolous or the same as a lawsuit in
 
06:28:29.708 --> 06:28:29.718 align:start position:0%
any way these are generally matters of a
 
06:28:31.788 --> 06:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
child needing a weekly speech or
 
06:28:33.510 --> 06:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy session of 30
 
06:28:35.430 --> 06:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
minutes child needing a little
 
06:28:37.468 --> 06:28:37.478 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional support and that's
 
06:28:39.868 --> 06:28:39.878 align:start position:0%
generally about all our neurodiverse
 
06:28:42.350 --> 06:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
kids need a common set of help and
 
06:28:44.670 --> 06:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
supports a set of things that's nearly
 
06:28:46.750 --> 06:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
standard for all of them and none of
 
06:28:48.150 --> 06:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
them should require fighting
 
06:28:50.788 --> 06:28:50.798 align:start position:0%
individually the same battle over and
 
06:28:53.390 --> 06:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
over and over these supports are very
 
06:28:56.230 --> 06:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
basic and relate to providing a free and
 
06:28:59.070 --> 06:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate education as justified by
 
06:29:01.948 --> 06:29:01.958 align:start position:0%
legitimate medical diagnosis and
 
06:29:04.628 --> 06:29:04.638 align:start position:0%
documentation often more than would ever
 
06:29:07.350 --> 06:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
be required even in a court of law and
 
06:29:09.350 --> 06:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
because of the burden of proof It's
 
06:29:11.830 --> 06:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
never enough how would you feel being
 
06:29:14.948 --> 06:29:14.958 align:start position:0%
denied a wheelchair if you couldn't walk
 
06:29:16.430 --> 06:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
how would you feel if you were forced to
 
06:29:18.390 --> 06:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
demonstrate you cannot walk because
 
06:29:20.910 --> 06:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
somebody can't see it there is no
 
06:29:22.830 --> 06:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
difference here please help our kids and
 
06:29:25.230 --> 06:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
schools come together in a better way
 
06:29:27.548 --> 06:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
let our families and schools work out a
 
06:29:30.070 --> 06:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
better process we don't need to invest
 
06:29:32.190 --> 06:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
this time of this kind of time and money
 
06:29:33.830 --> 06:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
to fight over whether a child needs
 
06:29:36.510 --> 06:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
basic supports and services let's invest
 
06:29:39.230 --> 06:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
where it makes sense please approve and

chairman lad thanks for hearing my
 
06:30:37.670 --> 06:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
testimony today I will try to keep it
 
06:30:39.430 --> 06:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
brief I know it's been a long day for
 
06:30:42.070 --> 06:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
all of you uh I'm Becky Wilson I'm the
 
06:30:43.948 --> 06:30:43.958 align:start position:0%
director of governmental relations for
 
06:30:45.510 --> 06:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
06:30:48.070 --> 06:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
Association I come to you today uh we're
 
06:30:51.548 --> 06:30:51.558 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 581 um and I
 
06:30:54.270 --> 06:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
want to also just um share this
 
06:30:56.230 --> 06:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
testimony with the background that I was
 
06:30:57.948 --> 06:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
prior to moving into this position a
 
06:30:59.708 --> 06:30:59.718 align:start position:0%
special ed director in New Hampshire for
 
06:31:02.110 --> 06:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
20 years um and out of those 20 years
 
06:31:03.788 --> 06:31:03.798 align:start position:0%
I've only gone through a full due
 
06:31:07.070 --> 06:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
process hearing one time it is a rarity
 
06:31:08.708 --> 06:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that speaks quite
 
06:31:10.628 --> 06:31:10.638 align:start position:0%
honestly I I know there's been a lot of
 
06:31:12.468 --> 06:31:12.478 align:start position:0%
testimony today about people's
 
06:31:14.750 --> 06:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
challenges um with the team process and
 
06:31:16.468 --> 06:31:16.478 align:start position:0%
the collaboration at the school level
 
06:31:18.788 --> 06:31:18.798 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that for most
 
06:31:20.990 --> 06:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
districts collaborating with families is
 
06:31:24.430 --> 06:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
at the priority level for all of these
 
06:31:26.948 --> 06:31:26.958 align:start position:0%
um decisions and due process truly is a
 
06:31:30.468 --> 06:31:30.478 align:start position:0%
last resort um in terms of resolving a
 
06:31:32.150 --> 06:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
dispute that can't be resolved in other
 
06:31:34.910 --> 06:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
ways um and that quite honestly uh there
 
06:31:37.350 --> 06:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
are times within the law where we are
 
06:31:39.948 --> 06:31:39.958 align:start position:0%
required to file a due process hearing
 
06:31:42.510 --> 06:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
to resolve a dispute so I certainly
 
06:31:45.190 --> 06:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
don't want it to sound as though um
 
06:31:48.110 --> 06:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
people are on either side frivolously
 
06:31:50.030 --> 06:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
filing for due process it's not
 
06:31:52.788 --> 06:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
something that is as common I think as
 
06:31:54.788 --> 06:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh what's been maybe portrayed today but
 
06:31:56.230 --> 06:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
I do want to speak from the Schoolboard
 
06:31:59.110 --> 06:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
perspective a bit um about the concerns
 
06:32:00.510 --> 06:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
I think I shared this with you in some
 
06:32:03.230 --> 06:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
written testimony already um there
 
06:32:05.230 --> 06:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
certainly are obviously the fiscal
 
06:32:07.430 --> 06:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
impacts of this bill were the burden of
 
06:32:09.548 --> 06:32:09.558 align:start position:0%
proof to shift to the school district
 
06:32:11.910 --> 06:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
all the time as some other people have
 
06:32:14.070 --> 06:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
already testified there are times
 
06:32:16.230 --> 06:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
already where the district shares has
 
06:32:17.628 --> 06:32:17.638 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof because they are the
 
06:32:19.388 --> 06:32:19.398 align:start position:0%
ones that filed for the due process
 
06:32:23.350 --> 06:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
hearing so this does not necessarily
 
06:32:25.910 --> 06:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
resolve it completely it's already
 
06:32:27.868 --> 06:32:27.878 align:start position:0%
resolved for a lot of the time when
 
06:32:31.030 --> 06:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
these file these are filed um but it
 
06:32:32.868 --> 06:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
would shift the burden of proof and
 
06:32:34.910 --> 06:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
persuasion to the district for any
 
06:32:37.230 --> 06:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
reason that a due process were filed
 
06:32:38.990 --> 06:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of who files for the due
 
06:32:41.750 --> 06:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
process um certainly the legal fees and
 
06:32:43.190 --> 06:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
things like that there are some
 
06:32:45.788 --> 06:32:45.798 align:start position:0%
insurance um benefits that districts do
 
06:32:47.830 --> 06:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
carry however the findings of the
 
06:32:50.510 --> 06:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
hearing if those carry with it uh an
 
06:32:52.990 --> 06:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
outof District placement perhaps um
 
06:32:55.030 --> 06:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
additional Services those C are not
 
06:32:57.270 --> 06:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
covered by insurance and those costs can
 
06:32:58.910 --> 06:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
stay with the district for a very long
 
06:33:01.468 --> 06:33:01.478 align:start position:0%
period of time it's rare that a case
 
06:33:03.990 --> 06:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
would go to do process towards the end
 
06:33:05.910 --> 06:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
of a child's School career quite
 
06:33:07.750 --> 06:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
honestly in the last two or three years
 
06:33:10.150 --> 06:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
most of these things are happening um at
 
06:33:14.150 --> 06:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
a younger level and some of the um the
 
06:33:16.750 --> 06:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
hearing findings or what's mandated to
 
06:33:19.548 --> 06:33:19.558 align:start position:0%
the district as a result if they were to
 
06:33:22.468 --> 06:33:22.478 align:start position:0%
um not win the hearing so to speak are
 
06:33:24.190 --> 06:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
years of placements that then would
 
06:33:26.070 --> 06:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
follow into the operating budget because
 
06:33:28.150 --> 06:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
they would no longer be considered
 
06:33:30.430 --> 06:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
unanticipated um so they couldn't use
 
06:33:32.270 --> 06:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
that um fund that several people have
 
06:33:34.628 --> 06:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
talked about in other conversations this
 
06:33:37.590 --> 06:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
session of um unanticipated special ed
 
06:33:40.110 --> 06:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
costs those can't be accessed once you
 
06:33:42.190 --> 06:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
know that this cost is now to be
 
06:33:44.590 --> 06:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
anticipated for a number of years those
 
06:33:46.030 --> 06:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
costs are going to downshift to the
 
06:33:47.910 --> 06:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
operating budget um and are going to
 
06:33:51.190 --> 06:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
fall to the taxpayers so um that
 
06:33:54.030 --> 06:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
certainly is a piece of the litig of the
 
06:33:57.468 --> 06:33:57.478 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact secondly going to hearing
 
06:33:59.868 --> 06:33:59.878 align:start position:0%
um is a lengthy procedure regardless of
 
06:34:01.788 --> 06:34:01.798 align:start position:0%
whether you are the family or the
 
06:34:04.350 --> 06:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
district if you are the district you are
 
06:34:07.468 --> 06:34:07.478 align:start position:0%
taking a a high number of Staff quite
 
06:34:10.030 --> 06:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
often out of the building out of the
 
06:34:13.270 --> 06:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
classroom to prepare for a hearing to
 
06:34:17.350 --> 06:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:20.310 --> 06:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
you go it could go for two days it could
 
06:34:23.230 --> 06:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
go for two months um and you are taking
 
06:34:24.990 --> 06:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
staff out of the buildings and out from
 
06:34:26.548 --> 06:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
the classroom of all the other students
 
06:34:29.388 --> 06:34:29.398 align:start position:0%
that are um looking for that person's
 
06:34:30.990 --> 06:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
instruction and those service providers
 
06:34:32.910 --> 06:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
to be there for them the district is
 
06:34:35.590 --> 06:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
incurring substitute costs as a result
 
06:34:38.310 --> 06:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
um as well as um District staff needing
 
06:34:41.868 --> 06:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
to be tied up so to speak um and lastly
 
06:34:44.910 --> 06:34:44.920 align:start position:0%
I will just say um and I want to speak a
 
06:34:46.590 --> 06:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
little bit to the I think there was a
 
06:34:48.430 --> 06:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
comment made earlier about the human
 
06:34:52.350 --> 06:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
cost of going to Due Process um and
 
06:34:54.670 --> 06:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
having a case go to Due Process early on
 
06:34:58.750 --> 06:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
in a child's School career um does erode
 
06:35:00.548 --> 06:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
that relationship with that family quite
 
06:35:01.750 --> 06:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
often between the family and the
 
06:35:04.030 --> 06:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
district for a very long period of time
 
06:35:05.590 --> 06:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
districts do not want to go to Due
 
06:35:08.030 --> 06:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
Process hearings um there are many other
 
06:35:09.830 --> 06:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
ways to resolve it there's neutral
 
06:35:13.030 --> 06:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
conferences there are mediations there's
 
06:35:16.750 --> 06:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
facilitated IEP meetings um shifting
 
06:35:18.910 --> 06:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
this cost shifting this burden approv to
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
the district all the time I don't see
 
06:35:24.388 --> 06:35:24.398 align:start position:0%
how that really um allows the parent
 
06:35:28.430 --> 06:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
parents more financial ability to secure
 
06:35:30.388 --> 06:35:30.398 align:start position:0%
um the support that has been brought up
 
06:35:32.548 --> 06:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
Shifting the burden doesn't
 
06:35:35.070 --> 06:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily somehow allow for more
 
06:35:36.948 --> 06:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
resources to be diverted to the parent
 
06:35:39.230 --> 06:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
unless there's a belief that by Shifting
 
06:35:42.110 --> 06:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
the burden um more parents will prevail
 
06:35:44.468 --> 06:35:44.478 align:start position:0%
in these cases and some of the findings
 
06:35:45.788 --> 06:35:45.798 align:start position:0%
will be for the district to have to
 
06:35:48.628 --> 06:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
reimburse for the cost of these parents
 
06:35:51.388 --> 06:35:51.398 align:start position:0%
fees and outside evaluations Etc that's
 
06:35:53.628 --> 06:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
the only way I that it makes sense to me
 
06:35:55.750 --> 06:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
of how this shift in the burden would
 
06:35:59.190 --> 06:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
somehow allow families to have uh more
 
06:36:01.990 --> 06:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
ability to pursue due process hearings
 
06:36:04.388 --> 06:36:04.398 align:start position:0%
so um I'm happy to take any questions
 
06:36:06.110 --> 06:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
from the committee I apologize for going
 
06:36:08.510 --> 06:36:08.520 align:start position:0%

association

06:36:16.350 --> 06:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:20.270 --> 06:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
yes I don't see any know I don't see any
 
06:36:23.510 --> 06:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
hands okay thank thank you very much
 
06:36:24.948 --> 06:36:24.958 align:start position:0%

06:36:34.430 --> 06:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
minutes I I think what I'm going to do
 
06:36:36.510 --> 06:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
from this point onward because we still
 
06:36:39.310 --> 06:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
have quite a few to speak I'm GNA limit
 
06:36:43.350 --> 06:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
people to three minutes please thank
 
06:36:46.030 --> 06:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
you okay go thank you to the can you
 
06:36:49.270 --> 06:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
hear me yes we can okay thank you to
 
06:36:50.708 --> 06:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
those who wrote this bill and brought it
 
06:36:53.670 --> 06:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
up for hearing um please consider my
 
06:36:56.150 --> 06:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
position as apparent victim of New
 
06:36:59.070 --> 06:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's um special education due
 
06:37:01.590 --> 06:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
process um I feel strongly that under
 
06:37:04.350 --> 06:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
the current rules the burden of proof in
 
06:37:06.030 --> 06:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
one of these hearings is absolutely
 
06:37:07.910 --> 06:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
insurmountable to any
 
06:37:07.920 --> 06:37:09.708 align:start position:0%
insurmountable to any
parent

06:37:09.708 --> 06:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
parent
 
06:37:12.430 --> 06:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
um you might think that this is Shifting
 
06:37:14.030 --> 06:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
the burden from the person who brought
 
06:37:17.548 --> 06:37:17.558 align:start position:0%
the action to always the school but
 
06:37:20.830 --> 06:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
there's very few defined cases where the
 
06:37:25.030 --> 06:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
school has to um file for due process C
 
06:37:26.430 --> 06:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
06:37:29.910 --> 06:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
an um initial
 
06:37:32.830 --> 06:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
evaluation to provide initial um
 
06:37:35.708 --> 06:37:35.718 align:start position:0%
services to the child or if the school
 
06:37:38.590 --> 06:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
does not wish to pay for an independent
 
06:37:41.548 --> 06:37:41.558 align:start position:0%
educational evaluation only in those
 
06:37:43.990 --> 06:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
cases does the school have the burden of
 
06:37:46.628 --> 06:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
proof um please check the percentage of
 
06:37:48.430 --> 06:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
due process hearings that are actually
 
06:37:51.910 --> 06:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
brought by the parent versus the school
 
06:37:54.910 --> 06:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
district um apparent will file because
 
06:37:57.230 --> 06:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
the child's not making progress if the
 
06:37:58.948 --> 06:37:58.958 align:start position:0%
parent were ever to win any type of
 
06:38:00.788 --> 06:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
complaint the most concerning outcome
 
06:38:02.750 --> 06:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
for the district is that they would be
 
06:38:04.270 --> 06:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
compelled to do what they were supposed
 
06:38:06.190 --> 06:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
to do in the first
 
06:38:09.830 --> 06:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
place um regardless of the type of
 
06:38:12.270 --> 06:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
complaint they could win quite a bit has
 
06:38:15.030 --> 06:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
been said about mediation mediation is
 
06:38:17.590 --> 06:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely optional for both parties and
 
06:38:20.230 --> 06:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
it was refused by my school district
 
06:38:22.910 --> 06:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
because they wanted to put the burden of
 
06:38:26.548 --> 06:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
proof on me I'm not a public speaker and
 
06:38:28.310 --> 06:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
the lawyer and the team of lawyers
 
06:38:28.320 --> 06:38:29.708 align:start position:0%
the lawyer and the team of lawyers
behind

06:38:29.708 --> 06:38:29.718 align:start position:0%
behind
 
06:38:29.718 --> 06:38:33.910 align:start position:0%
behind
are

06:38:33.910 --> 06:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:36.548 --> 06:38:36.558 align:start position:0%
um those that oppose this bill claim you
 
06:38:38.468 --> 06:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
have the whole team they must invite you
 
06:38:40.750 --> 06:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
to meetings well yes they do but what
 
06:38:42.230 --> 06:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
comes out of those meetings and gets
 
06:38:44.110 --> 06:38:44.120 align:start position:0%
placed into the written IEP is at the
 
06:38:45.430 --> 06:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
discretion of the special head
 
06:38:47.548 --> 06:38:47.558 align:start position:0%
Department administrator take it or
 
06:38:47.558 --> 06:38:48.310 align:start position:0%
Department administrator take it or
leave

06:38:48.310 --> 06:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
leave
 
06:38:48.320 --> 06:38:50.230 align:start position:0%
leave
it

06:38:50.230 --> 06:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:38:53.388 --> 06:38:53.398 align:start position:0%
um there's also um if the district is
 
06:38:56.468 --> 06:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
non-compliant client non-compliant in
 
06:38:58.788 --> 06:38:58.798 align:start position:0%
providing Services agreed to by the
 
06:39:01.708 --> 06:39:01.718 align:start position:0%
whole team but the IEP contains words or
 
06:39:04.270 --> 06:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
phrases put in there by administrators
 
06:39:06.830 --> 06:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
such as as needed or when required you
 
06:39:09.388 --> 06:39:09.398 align:start position:0%
lose the school has experts that can
 
06:39:11.990 --> 06:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
complain that can claim they didn't feel
 
06:39:13.948 --> 06:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
it was needed or it turned out it wasn't
 
06:39:16.830 --> 06:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
required up to X hours actually means
 
06:39:19.310 --> 06:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere from zero to X hours and the
 
06:39:23.670 --> 06:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
district is compant at zero parent files
 
06:39:25.548 --> 06:39:25.558 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education recommends
 
06:39:27.350 --> 06:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
against using these words and phrases
 
06:39:29.110 --> 06:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
because they might be misinterpreted but
 
06:39:31.270 --> 06:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
they don't prohibit it every word in an
 
06:39:33.910 --> 06:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
IEP is reviewed by the district
 
06:39:36.150 --> 06:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
administrator parent files for due
 
06:39:41.510 --> 06:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:44.030 --> 06:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
options if there's one thing a special
 
06:39:47.670 --> 06:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
education administrator can do it's St
 
06:39:50.150 --> 06:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
hold another meeting rescheduling the
 
06:39:51.990 --> 06:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
meeting continuing it because of a
 
06:39:54.548 --> 06:39:54.558 align:start position:0%
concern that the parent got got pushed
 
06:39:56.110 --> 06:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
to the end of the meeting and time ran
 
06:39:58.310 --> 06:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
out are requiring updated testing that
 
06:40:00.750 --> 06:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
will take some time to complete we have
 
06:40:04.788 --> 06:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
deadlines to file and um the school can
 
06:40:07.670 --> 06:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
push us Beyond those deadlines I want to
 
06:40:12.510 --> 06:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
um speak in on behalf of bill um 581 and
 
06:40:15.270 --> 06:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you listening thank you
 
06:40:16.708 --> 06:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
06:40:16.718 --> 06:40:19.948 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
any

06:40:19.948 --> 06:40:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:22.150 --> 06:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
06:40:26.110 --> 06:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:28.708 --> 06:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay next we have Bonnie Dunham Bonnie
 
06:40:32.750 --> 06:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:36.350 --> 06:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
education thank you very much um I
 
06:40:38.590 --> 06:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to make I think I'm unmuted now
 
06:40:41.948 --> 06:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um I am very much in
 
06:40:44.788 --> 06:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and I appreciate um
 
06:40:46.548 --> 06:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli bringing it
 
06:40:48.830 --> 06:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
Forward first it's important to know
 
06:40:50.990 --> 06:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
that there are not very many due process
 
06:40:52.990 --> 06:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
hearings in New Hampshire we've had an
 
06:40:55.270 --> 06:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
average of 3 per year over the past 5
 
06:40:57.750 --> 06:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
years and which means that most often
 
06:40:59.788 --> 06:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
parents in schools work their issues out
 
06:41:02.190 --> 06:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
before they get to a due process hearing
 
06:41:04.310 --> 06:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and and New Hampshire does have a lot
 
06:41:06.310 --> 06:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
of options that go beyond even those
 
06:41:08.150 --> 06:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
required by the federal law for that to
 
06:41:10.548 --> 06:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
happen but when a parent does decide
 
06:41:12.030 --> 06:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
that they need to file a due process
 
06:41:14.750 --> 06:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
hearing it's because they they really
 
06:41:16.468 --> 06:41:16.478 align:start position:0%
believe that's the only option for them
 
06:41:18.708 --> 06:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
to receive the services that their child
 
06:41:21.110 --> 06:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
needs something has gone wrong they've
 
06:41:23.510 --> 06:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
they've seen their child fail um and
 
06:41:25.468 --> 06:41:25.478 align:start position:0%
they just reach the point where nothing
 
06:41:27.230 --> 06:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
else will work and as someone already
 
06:41:29.910 --> 06:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned some of the other options the
 
06:41:31.788 --> 06:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution options
 
06:41:33.708 --> 06:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
are voluntary and so if the school
 
06:41:36.190 --> 06:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to go the parent is left
 
06:41:38.788 --> 06:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
with very few choices
 
06:41:42.150 --> 06:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
um we when we have those few due process
 
06:41:45.430 --> 06:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
hearings per year parents rarely win
 
06:41:47.590 --> 06:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's an it's an imbalanced situation in
 
06:41:49.628 --> 06:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
the past five years parents have won
 
06:41:53.110 --> 06:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
about 10% of those due process hearings
 
06:41:56.070 --> 06:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
um and so it certainly does discourage
 
06:41:58.910 --> 06:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
people from using that process um
 
06:42:02.230 --> 06:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
because of those low numbers and and so
 
06:42:04.388 --> 06:42:04.398 align:start position:0%
it's a real challenge for families
 
06:42:06.190 --> 06:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
there's an inherence imbalance in that
 
06:42:10.030 --> 06:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
process because sorry because when the
 
06:42:11.628 --> 06:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
evidence is presented by the both
 
06:42:13.548 --> 06:42:13.558 align:start position:0%
parties first you only burden of proof
 
06:42:16.468 --> 06:42:16.478 align:start position:0%
only comes up if it's if it's close if
 
06:42:18.708 --> 06:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
the person can't determine clearly which
 
06:42:21.070 --> 06:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
person has made their case and so it's
 
06:42:22.708 --> 06:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
not even an issue that comes up very
 
06:42:24.948 --> 06:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
often but when it does it makes sense
 
06:42:26.510 --> 06:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
that it be the school district that
 
06:42:29.030 --> 06:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
carries that burden of proof um even the
 
06:42:31.230 --> 06:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court while they ruled in favor
 
06:42:34.350 --> 06:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
of of the party that has filed for the
 
06:42:36.190 --> 06:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
hearing having the burden approved they
 
06:42:37.948 --> 06:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
recognize that schools have a natural
 
06:42:42.670 --> 06:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
advantage in that process um and so what
 
06:42:44.388 --> 06:42:44.398 align:start position:0%
and some of that natural Advantage comes
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
because schools have more experience
 
06:42:48.110 --> 06:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
they know the special ed law they have
 
06:42:50.190 --> 06:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
experience with the procedures they have
 
06:42:51.788 --> 06:42:51.798 align:start position:0%
access to more resources including the
 
06:42:53.708 --> 06:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
teachers evaluators and specialed
 
06:42:56.110 --> 06:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
education experts and they have control
 
06:42:58.468 --> 06:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
over the witnesses many of the witnesses
 
06:43:01.190 --> 06:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
work for them it's really hard to
 
06:43:03.548 --> 06:43:03.558 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to your employer
 
06:43:06.590 --> 06:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
um and so that that um can make for a
 
06:43:06.600 --> 06:43:07.750 align:start position:0%
um and so that that um can make for a
difficult

06:43:07.750 --> 06:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
06:43:09.750 --> 06:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
situation and schools are better
 
06:43:12.030 --> 06:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
prepared to carry the burden of proof
 
06:43:14.310 --> 06:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
when a school district develops a
 
06:43:16.510 --> 06:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
proposal to a school to a parent for
 
06:43:19.948 --> 06:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
example a draft IEP or a proposed IEP
 
06:43:21.910 --> 06:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to have the the data
 
06:43:23.990 --> 06:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
the information that supports that
 
06:43:25.990 --> 06:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
proposal that that can convince the
 
06:43:27.948 --> 06:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
parent that here's why this is going to
 
06:43:29.070 --> 06:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
provide your child with a free
 
06:43:31.388 --> 06:43:31.398 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education so if they
 
06:43:33.150 --> 06:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
do end up going to a hearing the school
 
06:43:34.910 --> 06:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
district has already done their work
 
06:43:36.350 --> 06:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
they have the information that they
 
06:43:40.070 --> 06:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:42.948 --> 06:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
case okay thank
 
06:43:46.350 --> 06:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
you minut
 
06:43:48.750 --> 06:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
Bonnie are there any questions uh
 
06:43:51.070 --> 06:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
represent LE you have a question I do
 
06:43:52.830 --> 06:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just very I just
 
06:43:54.670 --> 06:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I heard right uh
 
06:43:56.510 --> 06:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
Miss Dunham you were saying that there's
 
06:43:59.270 --> 06:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
approximately three cases filed per year
 
06:44:02.628 --> 06:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
of late is that it that it's there are
 
06:44:04.190 --> 06:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
approximately three that are held
 
06:44:07.110 --> 06:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes people resolve prior or they
 
06:44:10.030 --> 06:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
withdraw okay uh just a brief followup
 
06:44:12.868 --> 06:44:12.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um and are some of those cases
 
06:44:14.868 --> 06:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
do they I think someone who testified
 
06:44:16.388 --> 06:44:16.398 align:start position:0%
previously said there are cases where
 
06:44:19.868 --> 06:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
the school actually files so would those
 
06:44:22.388 --> 06:44:22.398 align:start position:0%
do do your numbers include those cases
 
06:44:24.670 --> 06:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
yes it was about 5050 it was um there
 
06:44:26.708 --> 06:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
were 16 and there were there were seven
 
06:44:28.510 --> 06:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
filed by parents seven filed by the
 
06:44:30.070 --> 06:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
school district and to that it really
 
06:44:31.750 --> 06:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear reading the report who
 
06:44:35.590 --> 06:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
filed I see okay thank you you're
 
06:44:38.110 --> 06:44:38.120 align:start position:0%

what your what Your I'm a parent of a
 
06:44:50.430 --> 06:44:50.440 align:start position:0%
child with disabilities and fortunately
 
06:44:51.948 --> 06:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
we were always able to work with our
 
06:44:54.670 --> 06:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
school to get what our son needed um but
 
06:44:57.430 --> 06:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
because of my professional job and my

connections to many support groups I
 
06:45:00.830 --> 06:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
speak to a lot of parents and I know
 
06:45:03.350 --> 06:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is a huge concern I also serve on
 
06:45:04.910 --> 06:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
the state advisory committee for special
 
06:45:06.628 --> 06:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
education but I am not representing any
 
06:45:09.110 --> 06:45:09.120 align:start position:0%

presentation thank you very much uh
 
06:45:15.990 --> 06:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
Bonnie I do have a question for you
 
06:45:18.548 --> 06:45:18.558 align:start position:0%
you've worked with groups with us many
 
06:45:22.070 --> 06:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
many times over the years here uh to try
 
06:45:24.190 --> 06:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
to improve specialed ucation and
 
06:45:28.110 --> 06:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
services to Charter Schools Etc um I
 
06:45:29.708 --> 06:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
have a question if a parent sitting in
 
06:45:31.628 --> 06:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
an IEP meeting and I've been through
 
06:45:34.468 --> 06:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
this as an administrator principal and
 
06:45:37.350 --> 06:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
teacher and the parent says I can't
 
06:45:40.430 --> 06:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
agree with that um and and an
 
06:45:42.670 --> 06:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
administrator writes in something such
 
06:45:46.270 --> 06:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
as as needed um that we've heard spoken
 
06:45:48.910 --> 06:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
to earlier this afternoon what recourse
 
06:45:51.830 --> 06:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
does that parent have if they don't sign
 
06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
what happens first they could say you've
 
06:45:56.310 --> 06:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
given me a lot to think about why don't
 
06:45:57.788 --> 06:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
we have another meeting so that we can
 
06:45:59.388 --> 06:45:59.398 align:start position:0%
talk about this more after we've both
 
06:46:01.150 --> 06:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
digested the information we've each
 
06:46:03.510 --> 06:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
presented they can ask for a facilitated
 
06:46:06.468 --> 06:46:06.478 align:start position:0%
IEP team meeting they have uh thirdparty
 
06:46:08.070 --> 06:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
moderated discussions they have
 
06:46:10.388 --> 06:46:10.398 align:start position:0%
facilitated IEP team meetings they can
 
06:46:13.230 --> 06:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
ask the school to go to mediation um or
 
06:46:14.670 --> 06:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
they may be able to go out and get more
 
06:46:16.510 --> 06:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
information themselves to make their
 
06:46:18.150 --> 06:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
case to the school district at another
 
06:46:20.510 --> 06:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
IEP team meeting why this child needs
 
06:46:22.230 --> 06:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
this why what you're proposing will not
 
06:46:23.948 --> 06:46:23.958 align:start position:0%
work um
 
06:46:25.750 --> 06:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
if ultimately they are not able to reach
 
06:46:27.628 --> 06:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
agreement then the parent either settles
 
06:46:29.388 --> 06:46:29.398 align:start position:0%
for what they believe isn't appropriate
 
06:46:31.468 --> 06:46:31.478 align:start position:0%
for their child is less than or they
 
06:46:34.230 --> 06:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
file for a due process hearing thank you
 
06:46:36.590 --> 06:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
very much thank you are there any
 
06:46:38.350 --> 06:46:38.360 align:start position:0%

06:47:18.430 --> 06:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
Hannon I'm a former State Rep and I'm
 
06:47:20.628 --> 06:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
the parent of a six-year-old a sixth
 
06:47:22.510 --> 06:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
grader with uh who has diagnosis of down
 
06:47:24.708 --> 06:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
syndrome uh my wife has been actively
 
06:47:26.150 --> 06:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
involved in the Down Syndrome community
 
06:47:27.830 --> 06:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
and different activist groups but uh
 
06:47:30.270 --> 06:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
she's unable to be here today because of
 
06:47:33.388 --> 06:47:33.398 align:start position:0%
work uh earlier there was mentioned of
 
06:47:35.350 --> 06:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
the the the ideas of innocence and
 
06:47:36.830 --> 06:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
burden and I'd like to say that first of
 
06:47:38.388 --> 06:47:38.398 align:start position:0%
all every child is innocent and the
 
06:47:39.990 --> 06:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
burden to provide a free and appropriate
 
06:47:42.628 --> 06:47:42.638 align:start position:0%
education is on the state and the school
 
06:47:44.948 --> 06:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
districts uh and a little background
 
06:47:46.708 --> 06:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
about my daughter I am very fortunate
 
06:47:48.788 --> 06:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
that my wife and I were both doctors we
 
06:47:50.628 --> 06:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
have a lot of resources to provide for
 
06:47:53.510 --> 06:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
our children the best that we can uh we
 
06:47:56.548 --> 06:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
only had one dispute with our uh uh
 
06:47:58.590 --> 06:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
school with uh in regards to my
 
06:48:00.788 --> 06:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
daughter's IEP and that was early on
 
06:48:03.388 --> 06:48:03.398 align:start position:0%
they wanted her to have uh part of her
 
06:48:05.590 --> 06:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
activities were uh to enhance core
 
06:48:07.270 --> 06:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
strength so they had pole dancing as one
 
06:48:09.468 --> 06:48:09.478 align:start position:0%
of her requirements and I was the only
 
06:48:11.030 --> 06:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
male in the room and I said well it's
 
06:48:12.430 --> 06:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
probably not a good idea so they quickly
 
06:48:14.868 --> 06:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
dropped it no court cases it was all fun
 
06:48:19.030 --> 06:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
and and well and good but um anyway uh a
 
06:48:20.788 --> 06:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
lot of parents aren't aren't able to
 
06:48:22.788 --> 06:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
access the same level of professional
 
06:48:24.548 --> 06:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
legal expertise the school districts
 
06:48:27.070 --> 06:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
have access to and that's a major factor
 
06:48:30.788 --> 06:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
and a major issue as to why um they they
 
06:48:32.388 --> 06:48:32.398 align:start position:0%
don't go forward with some of these
 
06:48:34.590 --> 06:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
cases uh whether it's the real or
 
06:48:36.430 --> 06:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
perceived costs of attorney
 
06:48:37.910 --> 06:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
representation and whether they can
 
06:48:39.590 --> 06:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
actually overcome these burdens of
 
06:48:41.628 --> 06:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
winning against the state we heard uh
 
06:48:44.110 --> 06:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
someone just say that about 10% of the P
 
06:48:46.310 --> 06:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
people win these cases when they go to
 
06:48:48.310 --> 06:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
that level uh in some states like
 
06:48:49.910 --> 06:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
Maryland which has been discussed
 
06:48:52.150 --> 06:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
significantly earlier about 15% of the
 
06:48:55.388 --> 06:48:55.398 align:start position:0%
cases brought are won by the parents and
 
06:48:57.628 --> 06:48:57.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of States uh that have the same
 
06:48:59.628 --> 06:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
burden on the the plane the person
 
06:49:01.708 --> 06:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
bringing the charge are are very
 
06:49:04.548 --> 06:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
similar um you know one of the big
 
06:49:07.070 --> 06:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
reasons uh you know the lobbyist earlier
 
06:49:08.670 --> 06:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
who mind you you know all these parents
 
06:49:09.830 --> 06:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
and people coming today are mostly
 
06:49:11.670 --> 06:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
unpaid people but the people trying to
 
06:49:12.910 --> 06:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
stop this actually have the money to
 
06:49:15.670 --> 06:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
bring a paid lobbyist in and that person
 
06:49:17.350 --> 06:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
said that a lot of these cases actually
 
06:49:19.468 --> 06:49:19.478 align:start position:0%
occur early on in the education of the
 
06:49:22.070 --> 06:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
child um well that's actually a good
 
06:49:24.388 --> 06:49:24.398 align:start position:0%
thing because if something is determined
 
06:49:26.190 --> 06:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
early that a child needs they have many
 
06:49:28.510 --> 06:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
more years to benefit from that service
 
06:49:30.350 --> 06:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
and ultimately if you can address these
 
06:49:33.030 --> 06:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
needs earlier we can save not just the
 
06:49:34.868 --> 06:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
child a lot of Anguish and improve their
 
06:49:37.230 --> 06:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
lives but we can save society as a whole
 
06:49:38.948 --> 06:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer in general from the burdens
 
06:49:40.310 --> 06:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
of having to provide for some of these
 
06:49:41.708 --> 06:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
individuals later in life because
 
06:49:43.468 --> 06:49:43.478 align:start position:0%
they've had a better education at an
 
06:49:45.548 --> 06:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
early time so in conclusion I'd like to
 
06:49:47.430 --> 06:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
just say 30 seconds left is great
 
06:49:48.750 --> 06:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
returning the burden approv to the
 
06:49:50.510 --> 06:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
school districts does not unduly burden
 
06:49:52.230 --> 06:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
the districts or the taxpayers and it's
 
06:49:53.948 --> 06:49:53.958 align:start position:0%
going to ensure the tax dollars are
 
06:49:56.388 --> 06:49:56.398 align:start position:0%
being spent on effective programs and
 
06:49:58.750 --> 06:49:58.760 align:start position:0%
enhances District accountability I'd be
 
06:50:00.948 --> 06:50:00.958 align:start position:0%

06:50:04.670 --> 06:50:04.680 align:start position:0%

University of New Hampshire in
 
06:51:15.110 --> 06:51:15.120 align:start position:0%

for many school districts in New
 
06:51:22.310 --> 06:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we worked with grants and
 
06:51:24.388 --> 06:51:24.398 align:start position:0%
what we did is um the project was to
 
06:51:27.070 --> 06:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
help schools become more proactive
 
06:51:28.868 --> 06:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
instead of reactive this is called
 
06:51:31.868 --> 06:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered systems of supports uh this
 
06:51:35.230 --> 06:51:35.240 align:start position:0%
work included system building uh for
 
06:51:37.948 --> 06:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
academics behavior and to produce fiscal
 
06:51:40.788 --> 06:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
Improvement both short and long term
 
06:51:43.350 --> 06:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
previously for 10 years I served on the
 
06:51:45.070 --> 06:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
special education State advisory
 
06:51:47.910 --> 06:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm back again right now
 
06:51:49.350 --> 06:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh I've earned a master's degree in
 
06:51:51.270 --> 06:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
education and I am currently enrolled in
 
06:51:53.788 --> 06:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
a jurist Doctrine program although I
 
06:51:55.628 --> 06:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
have had extensive training in the
 
06:51:57.468 --> 06:51:57.478 align:start position:0%
educational field the road through
 
06:51:59.868 --> 06:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
special education was difficult with my
 
06:52:02.670 --> 06:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
family and my daughter despite my gra
 
06:52:04.190 --> 06:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
background and having a good school
 
06:52:06.270 --> 06:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
district to work with we had many
 
06:52:09.110 --> 06:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
challenges in our educational experience
 
06:52:11.590 --> 06:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
one of the big ones starting with the
 
06:52:13.628 --> 06:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
school trying to suspend my daughter
 
06:52:15.310 --> 06:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
from the upper elementary school because
 
06:52:17.788 --> 06:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
of behavior difficulties which behavior
 
06:52:19.190 --> 06:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
is part of her
 
06:52:23.030 --> 06:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
diagnosis the IEP team had decided to to
 
06:52:25.468 --> 06:52:25.478 align:start position:0%
have her attend a private school and I
 
06:52:28.310 --> 06:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
was in agreement I was I I always say
 
06:52:30.910 --> 06:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
this is my first time ever having a
 
06:52:33.590 --> 06:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
however old child with a disability I
 
06:52:37.230 --> 06:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
had no experience before um the IEP team
 
06:52:39.190 --> 06:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
decided to have her attend this private
 
06:52:41.350 --> 06:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
school I was in agreement until she was
 
06:52:43.548 --> 06:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
restrained and put into a seclusion room
 
06:52:46.230 --> 06:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis I did not realize that
 
06:52:49.070 --> 06:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
restraints and seclusion was a customary
 
06:52:52.190 --> 06:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
practice despite being an educator after
 
06:52:54.070 --> 06:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
finding br on my daughter I pulled her
 
06:52:56.110 --> 06:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
out of that private school however the
 
06:52:58.270 --> 06:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
public school did not let her come back
 
06:52:59.910 --> 06:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
the school said she was too dangerous
 
06:53:01.990 --> 06:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
for the public school now since she had
 
06:53:04.670 --> 06:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
been restrained suddenly after seven
 
06:53:08.070 --> 06:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
years of public school she was too
 
06:53:10.150 --> 06:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
dangerous I filed a complaint with the
 
06:53:12.110 --> 06:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Education it
 
06:53:13.750 --> 06:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
was only through the help of the parent
 
06:53:16.990 --> 06:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
information center specifically Bonnie
 
06:53:19.388 --> 06:53:19.398 align:start position:0%
that I had any idea on even how to do
 
06:53:22.190 --> 06:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
this again despite being an educator I
 
06:53:24.388 --> 06:53:24.398 align:start position:0%
had documented mented everything so the
 
06:53:25.948 --> 06:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
results of the complaint were in my
 
06:53:27.628 --> 06:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
favor and they ordered the school to
 
06:53:29.948 --> 06:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
have my child return to public school
 
06:53:31.910 --> 06:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
and for the district to have training in
 
06:53:35.270 --> 06:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
her rare syrum the pain and tears that I
 
06:53:38.150 --> 06:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
experienced are what continue to fuel my
 
06:53:41.388 --> 06:53:41.398 align:start position:0%
desire to help others due to my unique
 
06:53:43.750 --> 06:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
background I have worked in well over 50
 
06:53:46.430 --> 06:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
schools here in New Hampshire I know
 
06:53:49.548 --> 06:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
what happens in schools mostly it's a
 
06:53:52.310 --> 06:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
systemic problem not a person problem
 
06:53:54.430 --> 06:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
School typically work in a reactive
 
06:53:57.150 --> 06:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
State and it's hard to be more proactive
 
06:54:00.150 --> 06:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
especially in special education however
 
06:54:02.030 --> 06:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
I will be honest there are some
 
06:54:04.270 --> 06:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
districts that have administrators who
 
06:54:07.388 --> 06:54:07.398 align:start position:0%
engage in bullying and retaliation to
 
06:54:09.788 --> 06:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
whether it be other employees or
 
06:54:12.910 --> 06:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
families you can spot this when you see
 
06:54:15.910 --> 06:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
that the the person never mentions the
 
06:54:18.430 --> 06:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
child's name throughout a whole meeting
 
06:54:20.830 --> 06:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
it becomes about adult problems and not
 
06:54:23.628 --> 06:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
children problems parents do not have a
 
06:54:25.670 --> 06:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
fair shot in the special education due
 
06:54:28.430 --> 06:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
process procedures it is expensive
 
06:54:30.948 --> 06:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
emotional and it is unfair to have the
 
06:54:33.190 --> 06:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
burden of proof lie in their laps the
 
06:54:34.990 --> 06:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
school districts with the taxpayers
 
06:54:37.868 --> 06:54:37.878 align:start position:0%
money hire attorneys to represent them
 
06:54:40.190 --> 06:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
not the student despite the committee's
 
06:54:42.788 --> 06:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
well-educated background without
 
06:54:45.310 --> 06:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
expensive representation arue I would
 
06:54:47.270 --> 06:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
argue that anybody on this committee
 
06:54:49.910 --> 06:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
would be able to win a special education
 
06:54:52.830 --> 06:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
due process hearing the schools have
 
06:54:54.830 --> 06:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
expertise they have the money and they
 
06:54:58.468 --> 06:54:58.478 align:start position:0%
have the tenacity currently the I'm
 
06:55:01.590 --> 06:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
sorry your time is up you want to close
 
06:55:04.468 --> 06:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
a sentence or that was my last line
 
06:55:06.150 --> 06:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
currently the special education due
 
06:55:08.468 --> 06:55:08.478 align:start position:0%
process burden prooof is imbalanced and
 
06:55:10.070 --> 06:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is the right thing to do for
 
06:55:11.948 --> 06:55:11.958 align:start position:0%

Hampshire resident and a parent uh in
 
06:56:51.948 --> 06:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
our amazing Granite State as a mother of
 
06:56:54.150 --> 06:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
two children both which have learning
 
06:56:56.388 --> 06:56:56.398 align:start position:0%
setbacks and require special education
 
06:56:58.708 --> 06:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
assistance I am testifying today in
 
06:57:00.468 --> 06:57:00.478 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
06:57:02.910 --> 06:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
581 I have to share that as a special
 
06:57:05.230 --> 06:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
education parent the current process is
 
06:57:06.948 --> 06:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
broken when relative to the burden of
 
06:57:08.948 --> 06:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
proof being held on the parent as a
 
06:57:10.868 --> 06:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
mother and constituent the process of
 
06:57:13.150 --> 06:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
advocating for my children has and will
 
06:57:15.388 --> 06:57:15.398 align:start position:0%
continue to be a full-time role to which
 
06:57:18.030 --> 06:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
I am not compensated nor do I expect to
 
06:57:20.350 --> 06:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
be we need to shift the burden of proof
 
06:57:21.510 --> 06:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
to help families throughout New
 
06:57:23.350 --> 06:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to hold districts accountable
 
06:57:25.750 --> 06:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
to federal and state laws in Nashville
 
06:57:27.788 --> 06:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
alone we currently have a number of
 
06:57:29.590 --> 06:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
state and federal complaints to the
 
06:57:31.948 --> 06:57:31.958 align:start position:0%
offices of civil rights in conjunction
 
06:57:33.670 --> 06:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
with countless

individual education plans Amendment
 
06:57:38.670 --> 06:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
meetings and we also have had to VI
 
06:57:40.628 --> 06:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
compensatory service requests for
 
06:57:44.430 --> 06:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
refusal of services House Bill 581 would
 
06:57:46.350 --> 06:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
not only help the financial constraints
 
06:57:48.350 --> 06:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
for families which often do not have the
 
06:57:49.948 --> 06:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
financial backing to fight their
 
06:57:54.750 --> 06:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:56.350 --> 06:57:56.360 align:start position:0%
help avoid significant financial
 
06:57:58.030 --> 06:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
setbacks for the students for the
 
06:57:59.430 --> 06:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
schools to begin at the ground level
 
06:58:01.230 --> 06:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
with proper construction and formatting
 
06:58:03.708 --> 06:58:03.718 align:start position:0%

education I spend the majority of my
 
06:58:08.070 --> 06:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
time advocating for my children's
 
06:58:09.628 --> 06:58:09.638 align:start position:0%
educational means which are protect
 
06:58:11.230 --> 06:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
which are protected by a number of
 
06:58:15.388 --> 06:58:15.398 align:start position:0%
federal laws Ida fape the Rehabilitation
 
06:58:17.830 --> 06:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
Act of 1973 and likely others to
 
06:58:19.670 --> 06:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
repetitively remind and fight the

town of nashille
 
06:58:25.230 --> 06:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
on these federal laws I spend countless
 
06:58:27.230 --> 06:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
hours to review rsas and federal
 
06:58:29.990 --> 06:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
statutes in order to have the vernacular
 
06:58:32.030 --> 06:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
to use these special education meetings
 
06:58:34.868 --> 06:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
as a platform to ensure that I'm
 
06:58:36.110 --> 06:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
consistently and effectively
 
06:58:38.388 --> 06:58:38.398 align:start position:0%
communicating the needs of my children
 
06:58:40.548 --> 06:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
in complete transparency I have to be
 
06:58:42.310 --> 06:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
honest with you that one of the most
 
06:58:42.320 --> 06:58:43.510 align:start position:0%
honest with you that one of the most
significant

06:58:43.510 --> 06:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
significant
 
06:58:46.070 --> 06:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
changes or eye-opening experiences for
 
06:58:48.510 --> 06:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
me has been the fact that I had to face
 
06:58:50.948 --> 06:58:50.958 align:start position:0%
as a result of covid-19 to run quick
 
06:58:53.910 --> 06:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
study IDE ideologies on the rules and
 
06:58:56.110 --> 06:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
regulations as well as federal and state
 
06:58:58.270 --> 06:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
laws again in order to advocate for my
 
06:59:00.788 --> 06:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
children's needs in 11 months many
 
06:59:03.510 --> 06:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
parents in my district alone have have
 
06:59:05.590 --> 06:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
faced a direct refusal of services in
 
06:59:07.030 --> 06:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
combination with a special education
 
06:59:09.190 --> 06:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
depart Department who went so far as to
 
06:59:11.030 --> 06:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
implement strategies to deny and refuse
 
06:59:13.350 --> 06:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
services to many special education
 
06:59:15.910 --> 06:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
students I would like to
 
06:59:18.910 --> 06:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
end with another statement of gratitude
 
06:59:20.670 --> 06:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to look into the
 
06:59:24.030 --> 06:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
positives of this bill and hold special
 
06:59:26.830 --> 06:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
educ departments to forcibly discontinue
 
06:59:29.030 --> 06:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
unlawful practices by way of Shifting
 
06:59:30.310 --> 06:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
the burden of
 
06:59:34.430 --> 06:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
proof hold on I'm so sorry the only way
 
06:59:36.110 --> 06:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
to do this is to help our children and
 
06:59:37.590 --> 06:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
families who do not have access to
 
06:59:39.590 --> 06:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
unlimited funding and to shift the
 
06:59:41.430 --> 06:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
burden of proof in order to force them
 
06:59:43.788 --> 06:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
to review their processes and compliance
 
06:59:46.548 --> 06:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion I implore you all to
 
06:59:49.868 --> 06:59:49.878 align:start position:0%
vote Yes on House Bill 581 to shift the
 
06:59:53.310 --> 06:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
burden of proof which would ideally
 
06:59:55.628 --> 06:59:55.638 align:start position:0%
enforce these districts to create
 
06:59:57.830 --> 06:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
policies at the bottom in order to avoid
 
06:59:59.750 --> 06:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
potential risk outcomes through
 
07:00:03.350 --> 07:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
litigation due process and mediation

Heather young I live in Rochester um I
 
07:00:50.708 --> 07:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm just getting in from from
 
07:00:54.388 --> 07:00:54.398 align:start position:0%
work so this is Lucas um and I did
 
07:00:56.190 --> 07:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
submit some written testimony this
 
07:00:58.310 --> 07:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
morning so I won't read everything all
 
07:01:01.030 --> 07:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
over again um I just wanted to reiterate
 
07:01:03.030 --> 07:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
the importance of supporting a bill like
 
07:01:07.788 --> 07:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
this um Lucas is in fifth grade um he
 
07:01:10.350 --> 07:01:10.360 align:start position:0%
does receive special education services
 
07:01:12.070 --> 07:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
we're a family who's very fortunate to
 
07:01:13.868 --> 07:01:13.878 align:start position:0%
be connected to many resources in the
 
07:01:15.548 --> 07:01:15.558 align:start position:0%
state including the parent information
 
07:01:17.590 --> 07:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
center and all of the trainings that
 
07:01:20.350 --> 07:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
they've been able to provide for us um
 
07:01:22.388 --> 07:01:22.398 align:start position:0%
if it wasn't for some of that I'm not
 
07:01:26.670 --> 07:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
sure where we would be uh we do um we do
 
07:01:28.388 --> 07:01:28.398 align:start position:0%
think that we're a family that's well
 
07:01:30.150 --> 07:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
connected and we still struggled really
 
07:01:33.190 --> 07:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
hard with our school district um despite
 
07:01:34.868 --> 07:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
the rules and laws in place that are
 
07:01:37.670 --> 07:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
there to support us uh we still continue
 
07:01:40.510 --> 07:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
to um have an issue with being able to
 
07:01:42.230 --> 07:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
prove that the services that were being
 
07:01:44.670 --> 07:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
provided were not adequate uh despite
 
07:01:47.230 --> 07:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
those rules helping to support that um
 
07:01:49.230 --> 07:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
the district does have an indispensable
 
07:01:50.910 --> 07:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
amount of money to bring attorneys or
 
07:01:53.670 --> 07:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
non attorney special Ed Consultants to
 
07:01:56.110 --> 07:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
the table um to fight against families
 
07:01:57.670 --> 07:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately happened in our
 
07:02:00.910 --> 07:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
situation for more than a year and we um
 
07:02:02.788 --> 07:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately could no longer continue
 
07:02:05.070 --> 07:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
to fight that battle um one for
 
07:02:07.388 --> 07:02:07.398 align:start position:0%
resources and two for for what it was
 
07:02:09.830 --> 07:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
doing to our family and our child um our
 
07:02:12.350 --> 07:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
child was getting injured at school um
 
07:02:14.310 --> 07:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
if a bill like this were in place to
 
07:02:17.190 --> 07:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
begin with um we would be able to to
 
07:02:18.910 --> 07:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
know that we could continue forward with
 
07:02:20.990 --> 07:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of energy that it would take
 
07:02:22.388 --> 07:02:22.398 align:start position:0%
and our son wouldn't have have to be in
 
07:02:25.388 --> 07:02:25.398 align:start position:0%
a private school right now um we're very
 
07:02:27.110 --> 07:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
fortunate for the school that he is in
 
07:02:28.990 --> 07:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
he is a valued member of that school but
 
07:02:31.110 --> 07:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately he's not with his his
 
07:02:33.430 --> 07:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
local peers um that he and community
 
07:02:35.670 --> 07:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
that he's grown up with for the last um
 
07:02:39.190 --> 07:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
eight years of his education so we do uh
 
07:02:41.548 --> 07:02:41.558 align:start position:0%
this is a desperate need um among other
 
07:02:45.230 --> 07:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
things to help our education um for
 
07:02:47.788 --> 07:02:47.798 align:start position:0%
students who receive special education
 
07:02:50.030 --> 07:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is definitely a step to to help
 
07:02:52.510 --> 07:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
with that um and I ask that you do
 
07:02:55.430 --> 07:02:55.440 align:start position:0%

07:03:34.070 --> 07:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
the school district for just over four
 
07:03:37.548 --> 07:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
years uh I've spent upwards of $20,000
 
07:03:40.230 --> 07:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
trying to help motivate his education to
 
07:03:42.670 --> 07:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
be on the right track uh that doesn't
 
07:03:44.948 --> 07:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
seem to help unfortunately my budget
 
07:03:46.990 --> 07:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't renew itself every year like the
 
07:03:49.948 --> 07:03:49.958 align:start position:0%
school districts does so in order for me
 
07:03:52.788 --> 07:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
to use those res ources that I could be
 
07:03:54.830 --> 07:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
using to enhance his life in other ways
 
07:03:56.708 --> 07:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
I'm using it to fight against the school
 
07:03:59.150 --> 07:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
district to me the words free and
 
07:04:01.670 --> 07:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate education has yet to apply
 
07:04:05.510 --> 07:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
to anything I've done or has been done
 
07:04:08.310 --> 07:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
about his education if you break down
 
07:04:09.468 --> 07:04:09.478 align:start position:0%
those words
 
07:04:12.270 --> 07:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
individually um it's certainly not free
 
07:04:14.548 --> 07:04:14.558 align:start position:0%
and his education certainly isn't
 
07:04:18.750 --> 07:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate um so um over the course of
 
07:04:21.150 --> 07:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
four years I've collected a notebook of
 
07:04:24.110 --> 07:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
pictures and photos of bruises and
 
07:04:28.110 --> 07:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
injuries that is it's very difficult to
 
07:04:30.190 --> 07:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
hold the school accountable for
 
07:04:33.948 --> 07:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
these injuries um that causes long-term
 
07:04:37.708 --> 07:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
emotional damage to him in fact going to
 
07:04:41.388 --> 07:04:41.398 align:start position:0%
school is a problem as is it uh being a
 
07:04:43.270 --> 07:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
mile from the school he starts to cry
 
07:04:46.230 --> 07:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
and grind his teeth uh causes lots of
 
07:04:50.868 --> 07:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
emotional stress um so the school has
 
07:04:53.590 --> 07:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
seemed to provide the lowest form of
 
07:04:56.270 --> 07:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
education for him which in turn keeps
 
07:04:56.280 --> 07:04:57.150 align:start position:0%
education for him which in turn keeps
him

07:04:57.150 --> 07:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
him
 
07:05:00.750 --> 07:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
disabled um we they don't Supply highly
 
07:05:02.830 --> 07:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
trained staff to implement the
 
07:05:02.840 --> 07:05:04.310 align:start position:0%
trained staff to implement the
appropriate

07:05:04.310 --> 07:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
07:05:08.110 --> 07:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
education um parents who are educated
 
07:05:11.030 --> 07:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
and pay attention and are involved are
 
07:05:11.040 --> 07:05:12.868 align:start position:0%
and pay attention and are involved are
often

07:05:12.868 --> 07:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
often
 
07:05:17.150 --> 07:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
um kind of deated to their character to
 
07:05:20.750 --> 07:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
the team and school often retaliates
 
07:05:23.590 --> 07:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
causing more issues isues um there's no
 
07:05:26.190 --> 07:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
accountability who's watching over the
 
07:05:28.388 --> 07:05:28.398 align:start position:0%
school district is it just the parents
 
07:05:31.388 --> 07:05:31.398 align:start position:0%
that file complaints is that how how
 
07:05:34.830 --> 07:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
they keep the schools accountable um
 
07:05:37.270 --> 07:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
during the remote learning process was
 
07:05:39.990 --> 07:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh we got a really eye openening
 
07:05:41.750 --> 07:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
experience of just how abusive his
 
07:05:44.190 --> 07:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
education is everything from the
 
07:05:47.310 --> 07:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
implementing to the schedule changes to
 
07:05:49.110 --> 07:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
just people not communicating on the
 
07:05:51.388 --> 07:05:51.398 align:start position:0%
team this has been from one end the
 
07:05:51.398 --> 07:05:52.310 align:start position:0%
team this has been from one end the
other

07:05:52.310 --> 07:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:05:53.910 --> 07:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
and so this has been happening in front
 
07:05:55.788 --> 07:05:55.798 align:start position:0%
of our eyes we can only imagine what
 
07:05:57.868 --> 07:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
happens when we can't see what's going
 
07:06:00.030 --> 07:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
on um
 
07:06:03.030 --> 07:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
so um being in there for four years he
 
07:06:05.430 --> 07:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't even know the alphabet yet he he
 
07:06:10.510 --> 07:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
can't he can't do much and so all the
 
07:06:12.350 --> 07:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
data that you collect and people talk
 
07:06:14.230 --> 07:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
about the data that's only as good as
 
07:06:16.708 --> 07:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
the people collecting it um we've often
 
07:06:18.468 --> 07:06:18.478 align:start position:0%
found lots of issues with the data
 
07:06:21.270 --> 07:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
collection being inaccurate and taking
 
07:06:23.868 --> 07:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
in properly and it makes things look
 
07:06:27.670 --> 07:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
good but in real life the reality is
 
07:06:30.350 --> 07:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
he's he's not gaining a lot so I'm in
 
07:06:32.430 --> 07:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
07:06:36.230 --> 07:06:36.240 align:start position:0%

receive special education I also have
 
07:07:34.310 --> 07:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
consider considerable experience working
 
07:07:36.030 --> 07:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
in the public schools with children with
 
07:07:38.310 --> 07:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
various disabilities that received
 
07:07:41.590 --> 07:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
special ad as a physical therapist um
 
07:07:44.270 --> 07:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'm a decoding dyslexia New Hampshire
 
07:07:46.070 --> 07:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
member I'm transitioning to a leadership
 
07:07:50.590 --> 07:07:50.600 align:start position:0%
role in that um group and I am a parent
 
07:07:54.110 --> 07:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative on the sack committee um
 
07:07:56.830 --> 07:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
and again I speaking in my own personal
 
07:07:58.990 --> 07:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
capacity not with regards to any of
 
07:08:04.110 --> 07:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
those groups or jobs um I do W to I
 
07:08:05.510 --> 07:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
won't read you know read through my
 
07:08:07.830 --> 07:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
whole written testimony testimony I hope
 
07:08:10.750 --> 07:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
you guys can look at it um but I do want
 
07:08:13.388 --> 07:08:13.398 align:start position:0%
to say that if a parent does have ample
 
07:08:16.150 --> 07:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
time money and
 
07:08:18.868 --> 07:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
resources um and the ability to handle
 
07:08:22.310 --> 07:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
the stress of um
 
07:08:23.868 --> 07:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
advocating for their
 
07:08:27.350 --> 07:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
child then they likely will be able to
 
07:08:29.708 --> 07:08:29.718 align:start position:0%
Bear the burden of proof s
 
07:08:32.110 --> 07:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
successfully um possibly file for due
 
07:08:33.788 --> 07:08:33.798 align:start position:0%
process settle at
 
07:08:36.350 --> 07:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
mediation um and not even have to go the
 
07:08:39.270 --> 07:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
due process route um and in order to
 
07:08:43.868 --> 07:08:43.878 align:start position:0%
prepare to um prepare to go to doe
 
07:08:46.350 --> 07:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
process um a parent really has to be on
 
07:08:48.510 --> 07:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
top of things from the beginning um
 
07:08:50.230 --> 07:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
which not all parents even realize that
 
07:08:53.468 --> 07:08:53.478 align:start position:0%
they need to um do so it's you know
 
07:08:56.830 --> 07:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
keeping track of emails keeping track of
 
07:08:59.708 --> 07:08:59.718 align:start position:0%
various things um periodically possibly
 
07:09:01.750 --> 07:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
getting private evaluations just to
 
07:09:03.708 --> 07:09:03.718 align:start position:0%
check it you know just to get a second
 
07:09:06.270 --> 07:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
opinion on how your child is doing so
 
07:09:09.070 --> 07:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that parents can do if
 
07:09:10.270 --> 07:09:10.280 align:start position:0%
they have
 
07:09:14.030 --> 07:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
resources um to even you know even
 
07:09:16.388 --> 07:09:16.398 align:start position:0%
prevent ever having to um file you
 
07:09:18.030 --> 07:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
process a common phrase that I have
 
07:09:21.750 --> 07:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
heard is the best way to prevent or to
 
07:09:23.750 --> 07:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
prevent due process is to prepare for
 
07:09:26.230 --> 07:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
due process so I just wanted to give you
 
07:09:28.468 --> 07:09:28.478 align:start position:0%
guys that perspective that if parents
 
07:09:30.628 --> 07:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
have you know again they have those
 
07:09:33.150 --> 07:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
resources then you know they'll probably
 
07:09:35.910 --> 07:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
be okay um and I'm not concerned about
 
07:09:38.830 --> 07:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
those parents I'm concerned about the
 
07:09:41.350 --> 07:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
millions of parents you know in the
 
07:09:42.788 --> 07:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
state that have children with
 
07:09:45.270 --> 07:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities that are not able to
 
07:09:47.868 --> 07:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
research special education laws you know
 
07:09:49.548 --> 07:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
they might even not even know there are
 
07:09:51.628 --> 07:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
federal laws in place and state laws in
 
07:09:55.030 --> 07:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
place um and and are not able to be on
 
07:09:57.190 --> 07:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
top of everything in the beginning um
 
07:09:59.388 --> 07:09:59.398 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about those parents who
 
07:10:01.150 --> 07:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
you know it might be after one you know
 
07:10:03.310 --> 07:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
a bunch of things have gone wrong that
 
07:10:05.030 --> 07:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
they start researching this stuff and
 
07:10:07.590 --> 07:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
have to go down this path of filing for
 
07:10:10.230 --> 07:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
due process and they may not be able to
 
07:10:12.910 --> 07:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
afford um private evaluations that can
 
07:10:15.350 --> 07:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
cost thousands of dollars and then on
 
07:10:17.590 --> 07:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
top of those private evaluations they
 
07:10:19.750 --> 07:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
would need to pick a private evaluator
 
07:10:22.590 --> 07:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
that could come to a due process hearing
 
07:10:25.030 --> 07:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
so that might not mean going to the best
 
07:10:27.230 --> 07:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals in Boston that might mean
 
07:10:29.310 --> 07:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
getting a very well-respected private
 
07:10:31.990 --> 07:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
evaluator that you could actually pay to
 
07:10:35.910 --> 07:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
come to a due process hearing so it's
 
07:10:39.708 --> 07:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
just a really really complicated process
 
07:10:43.510 --> 07:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
and it is at this time I feel you know
 
07:10:46.548 --> 07:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
strongly stacked against parents that do
 
07:10:49.788 --> 07:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
not have the resources and this bill you
 
07:10:52.270 --> 07:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
know I don't think it will all of those
 
07:10:54.150 --> 07:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
problems there'll still be parents that
 
07:10:57.510 --> 07:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
can you know afford expert Witnesses and
 
07:10:59.830 --> 07:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
and all of that stuff but there but for
 
07:11:02.310 --> 07:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
the parents that can't afford that this
 
07:11:04.548 --> 07:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
this should help them a little bit the
 
07:11:07.310 --> 07:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
the schools have the resources they have
 
07:11:10.868 --> 07:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
the specialists in the schools um they
 
07:11:12.510 --> 07:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
have the people to do the
 
07:11:14.868 --> 07:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
evaluations you know they sometimes it's
 
07:11:16.910 --> 07:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
just a matter of picking the correct
 
07:11:19.910 --> 07:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
evaluation for the student um so picking
 
07:11:22.468 --> 07:11:22.478 align:start position:0%
the most appropriate evaluations for a
 
07:11:25.670 --> 07:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
child with dyslexia as opposed to you
 
07:11:28.750 --> 07:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
know you know picking things that um
 
07:11:31.750 --> 07:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
aren't always consider the the um most
 
07:11:33.990 --> 07:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate for kids with dyslexia so
 
07:11:36.070 --> 07:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
anyway I just think that this bill is
 
07:11:37.830 --> 07:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
really important for those parents that
 
07:11:41.788 --> 07:11:41.798 align:start position:0%
are disadvantaged and I support HB 581
 
07:11:43.510 --> 07:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
and I encourage you guys to read my
 
07:11:46.510 --> 07:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony and um really really
 
07:11:49.230 --> 07:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
strongly consider supporting this um to
 
07:11:50.788 --> 07:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
help make sure all students in New
 
07:11:52.388 --> 07:11:52.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have access to a free and
 
07:11:53.868 --> 07:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
