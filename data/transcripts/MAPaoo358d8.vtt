00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday morning
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
um I um had been looking through all of
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
my emails we had talked about the
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
retained bills I sent out a list of the
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
retained bills to all of the committee
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
members hopefully everyone received it
 
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
and um uh you know I it also indicated
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh everybody who has expressed an
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
interest in certain bills to date uh I
 
00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
apologize I didn't have a chance to
 
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
update this after I sent it out I
 
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
received a few emails after this got
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
sent out yesterday morning I know
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative Leon had sent me an email
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
I didn't have a chance to put her
 
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
information on here or representative
 
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379 align:start position:0%
I think they may have been one of two
 
00:08:28.379 --> 00:08:29.390 align:start position:0%
I think they may have been one of two
others

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh basically what I'm hoping
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
to do this morning
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
is go through the various bills I put
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
down the people who have expressed
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
interest so far and particular bills
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
working on them as we know we have until
 
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
I think it's November
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
anybody know the date the final date uh
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
we haven't well deep into the fall
 
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
anyway before we have to resolve them uh
 
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
and uh it's my understanding in July and
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
August we really can't uh meet oh if we
 
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
do uh we uh it's going to be sanctioned
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
um and that they they discourage uh
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
summertime meetings but we do have a
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
little bit of time in June uh for some
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
of the most
 
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 17 November 17th I think
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
that's the anniversary of the Bolshevik
 
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
Revolution or something but uh anyway
 
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.350 align:start position:0%
Revolution or something but uh anyway
um

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
I remember my history but um uh you know
 
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
some of the simpler bills we might be
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
able to work on in June but many of
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
these are going to take certainly well
 
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
into the fall to complete
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
um so anyway uh with that I'll uh I'll
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
open it for discussion any thoughts on
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh and and actually before we get too
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
far I'd like to update names in terms of
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
um who wants to work on what because
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
again some of those emails I did not
 
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
um there was an email from
 
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.870 align:start position:0%
um there was an email from
representative

00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh she is interested in 317.
 
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:07.820 align:start position:0%
if you want to write these down
 
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:11.300 align:start position:0%
uh 368
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
378 and then there are three that are
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
not on your list
 
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.090 align:start position:0%
not on your list
um

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.090 align:start position:0%
um
580

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.449 align:start position:0%
 
619

00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
well 580 is on the back oh is it oh okay
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
no wonder I couldn't find it 580 619
 
00:10:32.399 --> 00:10:34.670 align:start position:0%
no wonder I couldn't find it 580 619
and

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
okay let me just repeat those back what
 
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
I may uh 2017 368 378
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
580 619 and 236. yes okay thank you and
 
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
if I may just I've said this to you but
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
I'll just state it for the committee I
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
think that there are several sets of
 
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
bills that could possibly be referred to
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
one particular subcommittee and the one
 
00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking of in particular are House
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 264
 
00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:14.899 align:start position:0%
um house bill 368.
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
and the opposite of 368 which is
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh the bill that for since 19619 those
 
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
three I thought it it particularly
 
00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019 align:start position:0%
because two bills are on the same
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
subject and take an opposite Viewpoint
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
it would be unfortunate if we referred
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
them to a two different subcommittees
 
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
who came to opposite conclusions sure it
 
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:44.180 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if we had at least
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
one set of
 
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
eyes looking at it for the first part
 
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
and if there's division at the end of it
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
of course that's
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
perfectly all right we do that all the
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
time sure thank you thank you
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%

thoughts um yes thank you um I'm

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.190 align:start position:0%

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
is important and it's looking pretty
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
light so I'll go up on that one as well
 
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.930 align:start position:0%
light so I'll go up on that one as well
okay

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
which one
 
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
I'm also interested in 317 but I think
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
he got enough staff on that one
 
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.769 align:start position:0%
he got enough staff on that one
okay

00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
any other representative mazura
 
00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:31.019 align:start position:0%
yes if you could add me to 368 and 619
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
with some of my colleagues that'd be
 
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.810 align:start position:0%
with some of my colleagues that'd be
great

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
okay 368 and what was the other one 6 19
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:53.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
there now
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
where we have two uh former chairman
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
here you can advise me is there a limit
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
to how big a subcommittee can be
 
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
no and and as you and I discussed
 
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.750 align:start position:0%
no and and as you and I discussed
earlier

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.430 align:start position:0%
earlier
um

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
subcommittees are supposed to be
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
composed in the same
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
makeup as the general makeup of the
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
house generally speaking that's a
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
protection for the minority and I have
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
seen in the past where sometimes by
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
agreement people have departed from that
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
and if everybody's in agreement with it
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to make any fuss about it
 
00:16:50.569 --> 00:16:50.579 align:start position:0%
but as you recognize there are certain
 
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
ones that are
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
political hot potatoes where it will be
 
00:16:58.449 --> 00:16:58.459 align:start position:0%
best if we stick to the sure
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:13.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
and if I may I mean there's no need for
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
you to actually give us a final decision
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
today okay all right
 
00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
all right I appreciate that yeah we'll
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
also through these and again I
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weber you suggested that
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
we have 264 368 and 619 is one
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee are there any other
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
groupings here that anybody would
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
recommend be another subcommittee
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd recommend the developmental
 
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
disabilities bills which is our 317 and
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
608 to be together
 
00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:49.669 align:start position:0%
608 to be together
yep

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
that was the other set but I was
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
everything for something
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay which two of those please
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
317 and 608.
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
and again these would be as a formal
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
subcommittee by both of these
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
yes I think that would be good right
 
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:07.850 align:start position:0%
yes I think that would be good right
okay

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
any other formal subcommittees that we
 
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
need the alternative being of course
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
more of an informal Discussion Group
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
um representative whoever if you name a
 
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:21.539 align:start position:0%
group it becomes a subcommittee of this
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
house so uh we may decide that we don't
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
want a formal subcommittee in which case
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
people are going to have to get together
 
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:29.780 align:start position:0%
on their own otherwise we're going to do
 
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
these issues right
 
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:41.630 align:start position:0%
these issues right
foreign

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
I would like to be added to uh 608
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
because that is something also being
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
explored by the
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
any others
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
okay any other bills here that would
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
lend themselves to uh any kind of formal
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that you can see
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
anybody thinks representative Leon thank
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I believe that the
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
sexual assault one may make sense to
 
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee so that we can hear
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
from those Prosecuting attorneys and
 
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
everybody else who has a stake into
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
whether or not these people should be
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
offered these kits down about 378 uh yes
 
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:34.010 align:start position:0%
offered these kits down about 378 uh yes
378.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's quite possible that the
 
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:41.780 align:start position:0%
organ donation one as well makes sense
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
587 since there's been some big changes
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
with the Uno's system to get a better
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
understanding of where New Hampshire
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
moves as the Nationals landscape is
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
again you're recommending a formal
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
subcommittee right and
 
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539 align:start position:0%
just to make your life either easier or
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
harder as the case may be I would
 
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
recommend that we had formal
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittees on all of this you have
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
people who have interests in all of the
 
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.570 align:start position:0%
people who have interests in all of the
bills

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and it really does for some of them
 
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:16.580 align:start position:0%
it may only need one meeting
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
but I think it makes good sense when we
 
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
have a lot of time and the ability to
 
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:24.140 align:start position:0%
schedule meetings
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
to have the formal subcommittee process
 
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
it's something that we did a lot more of
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
in the pre-covered days and have gotten
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
away from but I think it really comes
 
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
out with a better result and either it
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
forges a consensus or it makes very
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
clear what the competing interests are
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
and it makes it easier for the full
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
committee to have and then the house to
 
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
have real confidence in the process and
 
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
that the people who wanted to be
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
included as stakeholders
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
have had their opportunity to be
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
included as stakeholders and and you
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
know they may or may not choose to take
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
up that offer but I think it's a better
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
process okay so that's my suggestion
 
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.490 align:start position:0%
process okay so that's my suggestion
okay

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
so we have 14 bills three five six seven
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
of them are addressed so far
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
as far as subcommittees any other
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
groupings that anyone would suggest that
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
lend themselves to a formal subcommittee
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
I think the others could have something
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
that he's put these standalones
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
is that unwieldy to have that many
 
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
again I'm just asking the question I I'm
 
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
not challenging the idea I'm just asking
 
00:21:39.409 --> 00:21:39.419 align:start position:0%
I think it I think it depends on how
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
willing people are to work on them
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
um but as far as I can see the work
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
needs to get done whether it's in a
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
formal subcommittee or whether it's
 
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:50.690 align:start position:0%
formal subcommittee or whether it's
informally

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
informally
 
00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
and I think the work ought to be done
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
formally if at all possible Mr chairman
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
in my first two terms in this committee
 
00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
that's what we did and that doesn't mean
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
this committee has to it just means we
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
found that useful okay
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
all right again that's something I'm not
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
as familiar with representative
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro and then
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering about House Bill 566
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
which is relative to establishing fund
 
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:23.900 align:start position:0%
for child care in early childhood
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
Educators and it seems to me like that
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
might have been
 
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
unusual that it came here as opposed to
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
coming to education in the first place
 
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.510 align:start position:0%
coming to education in the first place
and

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
if we're going to continue with it and
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
have a retained Bill committee
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
is it possible to overlap with the
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
education committee because it seems
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
like if another bill was created out of
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
this retained bill that it would
 
00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:54.539 align:start position:0%
very likely go to the education
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
committee and not to us children and
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
family or children and family
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson for this special
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
committee on this very subject Chair by
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative rossbury right
 
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
I'm about to get some advice on this
 
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.190 align:start position:0%
I'm about to get some advice on this
matter

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
once we've had here and she'll suffering
 
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:22.460 align:start position:0%
well yeah but I mean
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
the education deals what they do not do
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
early check but they don't
 
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.230 align:start position:0%
early check but they don't
okay

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
education does not deal with Early
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
Childhood issues so
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
right or a special committee on Child
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
earlier in the process representative
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
Weber and representative and I tried to
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
process out some of these bills to other
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
committees and we were not successful we
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
were told careful consideration had been
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
made in the assignments and they were
 
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:54.299 align:start position:0%
hours and I can't remember if this was
 
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
one of them or not but it was it was
 
00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.610 align:start position:0%
one of them or not but it was it was
okay

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:57.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative thank you actually in
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
that vein one of the bills that's been
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
noticed on our calendar 527 had been
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
vacated to finance so that's why it's
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
not on our allocation list if anybody
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
has been comparing those two so it's
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
noticed for us here but that's a finance
 
00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:16.310 align:start position:0%
noticed for us here but that's a finance
bill

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
oh yes yes thank you sir Mr chairman uh
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
even if you can't get rid of the Early
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
Childhood bill you could certainly uh as
 
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
you know bring in that subcommittee as
 
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
consultants to update U.S to their
 
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.850 align:start position:0%
consultants to update U.S to their
thinking

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:39.740 align:start position:0%
okay yeah that's that's true
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
we also have in in the somewhat more
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
distant past there was a tradition of
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
when a bill was assigned to a particular
 
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
committee but it particularly pertained
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
to two different committees
 
00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:00.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking of one that was
 
00:25:03.529 --> 00:25:03.539 align:start position:0%
administrative adjudications in the
 
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:06.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
we have had a member of the other
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
Committee just sit in to advise they
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't get a vote they're not an official
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
member but you could certainly you would
 
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
certainly be within your rights I think
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
to ask if somebody from either of the
 
00:25:27.649 --> 00:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
other committees and and certainly there
 
00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:30.059 align:start position:0%
are people who are on both might come
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
and help aid with the deliberations
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson are you on
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative Aries committee as an
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
adjunct member yes okay but we do have
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
somebody who's on the committee
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
um as a regular full participant member
 
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
who's also on children and family law is
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
that representative Nelson don't ask
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
well I'm thinking Bill Nelson yes my
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
external memory stick says you're right
 
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:04.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative Simone is on both also
 
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.470 align:start position:0%
representative Simone is on both also
okay

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:28.130 align:start position:0%
 
two

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro I don't know if
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
there is a final disposition on this I
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
it's an area that I have a lot of
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
interest in but I'm hesitant to
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
participate in a you know a subcommittee
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
if it's really belongs someplace else
 
00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be acted on someplace
 
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.169 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be acted on someplace
else

00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:26:45.179 --> 00:26:49.909 align:start position:0%
else
um

00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
we've already had hearings on it and
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
everything else yeah okay we we it's my
 
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
understanding once you start having
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
hearings and taking do you know taking
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
it up in committee you stuck with it
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's why you know again a few of us
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
try to get rid of some of these things
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
early on and
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
not successful so get on it okay I'll
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
then I would
 
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
um express interest in that committee as
 
00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.950 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:36.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
any other thoughts or interests
 
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
um yeah I will swap these through and
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
formal appointments of chairman and vice
 
00:27:58.610 --> 00:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
chairman of the subcommittees and you
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
know we can sift through that in the
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
days to come and again we want we want
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
to balance all of these out and not only
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
because we have to but because you know
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
we should if we're going to come up with
 
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
meaningful conclusions and
 
00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:16.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
that 566 looks like so
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
if it is going to go forward and I
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
thought maybe it went with just with
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
just representative Cushman but if it's
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
now the compliments filling up I'd like
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
to be on that as well okay all right
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative King also
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
representative King had mentioned
 
00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
earlier he'd like to be on it
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
anyone else on this uh bill or any
 
00:28:42.779 --> 00:28:45.169 align:start position:0%
anyone else on this uh bill or any
others

00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:46.669 align:start position:0%
others
okay

00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
all right well it's a work in progress
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
but thank you for all of the input I
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and I'll uh I'll get
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
back to you at least via email and um
 
00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
and then obviously we'll be meeting
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
again anyway
 
00:29:00.659 --> 00:29:01.430 align:start position:0%
again anyway
um

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
Ms Dyer has given us
 
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:04.970 align:start position:0%
Ms Dyer has given us
um

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
side by side so
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
Senate action on a couple of our bills
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
and the purpose here is uh
 
00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative Weber had suggested if I
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
remember correctly maybe a straw poll in
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
terms of what we should do going forward
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
um in terms of conferring non-concurring
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro can I just go
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
back to the previous conversation sorry
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
um I would just I don't know what other
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
people's interest or lack of interest in
 
00:29:34.909 --> 00:29:34.919 align:start position:0%
this but I I was just thinking if for
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
those of us who live further away if we
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
could kind of overlap some of the
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
scheduling of these subcommittees
 
00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.169 align:start position:0%
scheduling of these subcommittees
um

00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
that some overlap on similar days so
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
those of us who are on two three four
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
committees might be able to come to
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
concrete walks I mean I'm going to defer
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
to subcommittee membership and
 
00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860 align:start position:0%
leadership in terms of when you want to
 
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.750 align:start position:0%
leadership in terms of when you want to
meet

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know you know I it's it's impossible
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
for me to know exactly what's going to
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
work out for all of you so uh you know
 
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
by all means I'd encourage you all to
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
work together and you know with your
 
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
respect to members to figure that out
 
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
but that makes absolute sense because I
 
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.450 align:start position:0%
but that makes absolute sense because I
know

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
we'd like to think it's a small state
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
there you go exactly exactly
 
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
we don't want to overwork those kiosks
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
in the lobby you know
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay anything else on the retained
 
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.909 align:start position:0%
okay anything else on the retained
Wheels

00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
Wheels
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
again getting back to the two Senate
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
bills a third one was just amended
 
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
um fairly innocuous changes but that one
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
we we don't have this morning but
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
um post Bill 238 and House Bill 408 the
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
changes are indicated here side by side
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
um these have been previously sent out
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
in an email
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted to get reaction uh
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately we'll have to make a
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
recommendation I would imagine on June
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
8th Miss Dyer
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
um we would need to make a
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation of concurring
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
non-concurring at that point
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh to the full house so and at some
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
point I think we need to take a formal
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
vote in this committee but I don't
 
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
believe we can do it this morning
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
because it was not noticed as such but
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weber we've never
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
noticed these oh ever okay
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know what the rationale
 
00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539 align:start position:0%
for that is we we do as a house often
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
ignore the right to know law but which
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
is not a great way to do it but before
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
we take a funnel vote on these we should
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
notice them in the calendar I would
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
assume no we we've never noticed
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
anything having to do with these and
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
various speakers have taken various
 
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
positions from uh on the one hand you
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
will have a meeting with your committee
 
00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
and even if it's you know calling people
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
up and and getting a vote from each
 
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.090 align:start position:0%
up and and getting a vote from each
person

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
and follow that vote to the chair will
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
make the decision and won't talk to
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
anybody on the committee about it at all
 
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
so I very much appreciate your including
 
00:32:15.409 --> 00:32:15.419 align:start position:0%
everybody but they have often been very
 
00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
informal you know Gatherings Under the
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
Clock in the in the hall or things like
 
00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:21.710 align:start position:0%
Clock in the in the hall or things like
that

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay and I I think maybe the rationale
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
for it is that it's the bill is no
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
longer in the hands of the committee the
 
00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:30.539 align:start position:0%
bill is in the hands of the house
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
and we're not a quorum of the house so
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
in that respect it may just fall
 
00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
completely outside the right to no law
 
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.490 align:start position:0%
completely outside the right to no law
entirely

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
chairman I had actually inquired of the
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
clerk as to that question and yes it's
 
00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:48.539 align:start position:0%
uh not a quorum because so this is now
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the Full House and while
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
I think we're an important 20 members
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
we're only 20 or 400.
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
five percent right
 
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
okay well any any reactions uh to 238
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
let's just take them in order
 
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:03.950 align:start position:0%
let's just take them in order
um

00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
any any thoughts
 
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.870 align:start position:0%
any any thoughts
any

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Shapiro
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
um if I'm understanding this correctly
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
and I I would uh appreciate being
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
corrected if I'm not it seems to me that
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
um the Senate amend amendments amend the
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
parts that are amended do two things one
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
is that they remove
 
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:33.500 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 238 now 38. so
 
00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:36.539 align:start position:0%
we had amended the part about
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
Contracting with contractors
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
um and um made it a little bit gave the
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
the quality Council a little bit less
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
power in that because we thought that
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
was a conflict but the Senate has taken
 
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
that out completely I believe
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
um so that's one change
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
so that there's no mention of the
 
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
um Quality
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
control Council being involved in the
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
Contracting process at all it doesn't
 
00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
mean they can't be but it's not like
 
00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:11.220 align:start position:0%
um required from this bill so that's one
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
thing the other thing is that just in
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
general from some of the small changes
 
00:34:17.329 --> 00:34:17.339 align:start position:0%
it seems to put more of the
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the council making
 
00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:23.300 align:start position:0%
recommendations versus
 
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.570 align:start position:0%
recommendations versus
DHHS

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:25.580 align:start position:0%
DHHS
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
requesting recommendations and um
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
for example on page there's no page
 
00:34:36.169 --> 00:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
numbers but the fifth page
 
00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:39.950 align:start position:0%
numbers but the fifth page
um

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
number eight on the house version
 
00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.889 align:start position:0%
number eight on the house version
um

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
it talks about the department reaching
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
out to the Quality Council about about
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
the possibility of changes and I believe
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
that that seems to be removed from the
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
Senate version
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
so it it kind of um requires more
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
initiative on the part of the the
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
quality Council versus the um Department
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
so those are the two changes I I see
 
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
um I know some people who came to
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
testify won't be happy with the part
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
that removes the part about Contracting
 
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.050 align:start position:0%
that removes the part about Contracting
um

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what that means in terms
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
of what I think
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
um I still think it's still a good bill
 
00:35:28.619 --> 00:35:30.650 align:start position:0%
um I still think it's still a good bill
um

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:35.099 align:start position:0%
mature thoughts uh concur not concur
 
00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
media conference uh
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not really I'm kind of up in the air
 
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
I'm not really I'm kind of up in the air
but

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
um I would hate to see the bill get
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
killed in the long run because I think
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
it still has value but um
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
maybe it could be better by sending it
 
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
to a committee of conference I I would
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
defer to other people's ideas before I
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
make my decision representative Pearson
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh when I first
 
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
ran for the house a number of years ago
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability issue was
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
one I decided to uh work on a lot
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
because of uh patients at my medical
 
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.050 align:start position:0%
because of uh patients at my medical
center

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
um our DD folks some of them and then
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
when I became chairman of DHHS oversight
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
three years ago I would be present when
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
the whole DD question would be coming up
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
again and again and while I believe the
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
people at DHHS who work on this very
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
issue are good people and motivated and
 
00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
so on I believe the more encouragement
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
from the quality Council the better for
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
their doing their work so
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
just another way of saying I'm sorry the
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
last part of this was left out by the
 
00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:54.950 align:start position:0%
last part of this was left out by the
Senate

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
other other comments uh representative
 
00:36:59.329 --> 00:36:59.339 align:start position:0%
Leon uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I think that when we look at this we
 
00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:02.099 align:start position:0%
also need to understand that the world
 
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
for the developmental disability
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
Community is in a lot of flux right now
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
they're changing some of the allowances
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
on the federal level we're changing the
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
way we do things here I think that even
 
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
if in the future we were to back off of
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
some of these requirements I think that
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
right now this more of a two-way
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
conversation is important so I think
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
that we probably need further work on
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
this to figure out where we can meet
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
with the Senate to make sure that people
 
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
are heard but it's not too much of an
 
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:28.250 align:start position:0%
are heard but it's not too much of an
illness

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
illness
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
so I would go for a committee of
 
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.150 align:start position:0%
so I would go for a committee of
conference

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
other comments representative McLean
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I basically agree with everything
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's been said I I would vote to to
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
non-concur I think none of these things
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
none of these things is binding but what
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
it's doing is it's forcing the
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
discussion and it's if there may be
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
things that might slip past them or
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
whatever in terms of contracts so it's
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
actively bringing them into the
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
discussion and as I said none of it is
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
binding so
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
um absence some concrete understanding
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
of why the Senate took it out I I can't
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
believe because his two burdensome would
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
be enough I think we should non-concur
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
and and have that discussion thank you
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
um I I will make the comment that
 
00:38:32.089 --> 00:38:32.099 align:start position:0%
tactically Bizzle is a risk with a
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and I have in the past occasionally
 
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
seen a really good bill
 
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
vanish because somebody on one side or
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
the other got cranky about it what has
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
traditionally happened in the house is
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
when somebody has said I'm not going to
 
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
go along with what maybe the majority of
 
00:38:59.930 --> 00:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
the two different subcommittees wants
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
the house Speaker has been very active
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
about removing that person and replacing
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
them with somebody who is shall we say
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
more amenable
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
I have also seen a time when
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
one member from the Senate was put on a
 
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
committee of conference for the sole
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
purpose of not concurring and making
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
sure that a bill died and they were not
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
replaced because that was their purpose
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
and altogether I cannot think why that
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
would happen with this bill because we
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
are very close and it's it's a matter
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
that I think all of us are very
 
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
concerned about and the question is just
 
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
how best to address the issues so I
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
think there's less likelihood that some
 
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
things that the wheels are going to come
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
off but I I just want to make sure that
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
those who have not lived with this
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
process before know that there are all
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
kinds of strange things that can happen
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
in the committee of conference process
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
but that being said I too think a
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee of conference would be
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
advisable on this one because
 
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
um as we know there's not only this bill
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
but there have been any number of other
 
00:40:11.339 --> 00:40:12.970 align:start position:0%
but there have been any number of other
bills

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:12.980 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
that have come before us about people
 
00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:17.099 align:start position:0%
who don't feel like they've been
 
00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:19.339 align:start position:0%
consulted properly and I think that
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
anytime we can encourage
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
the people that our laws affect the
 
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
lives of to have their input considered
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're more likely to
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
make better decisions for one thing and
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
if they disagree with the final decision
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
they will be more willing to accept it
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
because they know that their voices have
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
been heard and listened to even if the
 
00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
anyone who does not agree with the
 
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
discussion anybody who thinks that we
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
should do the non-concare period or
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
um open current
 
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
everything seems to suggest that we want
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
to non-concur and ask for a committee of
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
conference is that pretty much the
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
sentiment representative Shapiro I will
 
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
I will agree with people who've
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
expressed that view very eloquently
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
all right saying no dissent on that then
 
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
that would be the recommendation I would
 
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
make to the Full House at the June 8th
 
00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.569 align:start position:0%
make to the Full House at the June 8th
session

00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
moving on to House Bill 408
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
um a little more straightforward
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
only one page at least
 
00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:32.750 align:start position:0%
only one page at least
so

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative profile
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman so this the
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate amendment was actually the
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
product of a a very collaborative
 
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
process between myself
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
um the policy director over the Senate
 
00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.190 align:start position:0%
um the policy director over the Senate
and

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
um Mr Williams and Abby Rogers from uh
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
from DHHS we came up with language that
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
satisfied the concerns that
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
dcyf had with regard to Foster family
 
00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:15.980 align:start position:0%
homes and and potential funding issues
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
we actually simplified the language I
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
think with respect to the protections
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
for children living in foster homes and
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
and we added a provision that DHHS will
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
submit a waiver request to the federal
 
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.230 align:start position:0%
submit a waiver request to the federal
government

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
to essentially
 
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:39.650 align:start position:0%
to essentially
um

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
you know to to to validate the the
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
assertion that
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
children in foster homes will have the
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
same rights to exemptions as
 
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
as anybody else in the state so
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
um my my request is that we do a simple
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
concur with this and uh and move this
 
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
one forward
 
00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
that had been your bill originally right
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes I'm the prime sponsor okay
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
and the discussion on 408
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
that is that we concur as as it's been
 
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
submitted here representative Weber
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
I think I think that you know the idea
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
of a waiver of the federal mandate is a
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
is a good one and either we will get a
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
waiver or we'll not get a waiver but in
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
the absence of a waiver it is possible I
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
I I would I would agree with a motion to
 
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.250 align:start position:0%
I I would I would agree with a motion to
concur

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
concur
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
the discussion on 408.
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will I will recommend to
 
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
the house that we concur
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
okay unless some yes representative
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:43:56.230 align:start position:0%
okay unless some yes representative
Weber

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
Weber
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
would you care to let us know what the
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
other one that's been amended that
 
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
you've referred to so that we can House
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
Bill 611 perhaps have a quick discussion
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
on that as well sure sure it just
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
happened last uh Thursday I don't have a
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have the copy I'm sorry
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh that'd be great if you
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
could okay thank you we might as well
 
00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.050 align:start position:0%
could okay thank you we might as well
sure

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
um Alicia uh Preston actually called me
 
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
about this yesterday and I wasn't sure
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
if we'd get to it this morning uh but if
 
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
on the event
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
we did I I did tell her I'd mention our
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
comments now one of the things it does I
 
00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:42.780 align:start position:0%
from what again I I don't have the in
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
front of me obviously but could you tell
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
us the book bill number uh six eleven
 
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
six one one
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
and it's one of my my understanding at
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
least in part perhaps completely it
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
basically substitutes one commission
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
with another it's about studying
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis and its future it's I guess
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's legalization uh in concert with a
 
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
lot of the other discussions that have
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
been held in recent days
 
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.270 align:start position:0%
been held in recent days
um

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
Alicia Preston had called me because she
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
represents clients who really understand
 
00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
growing it and and
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
the whole the whole nature of the
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
product and this commission does not
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
allow for anybody who has actually has
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
that insight and experience to be on the
 
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.210 align:start position:0%
that insight and experience to be on the
commission

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
and she said you know if it's going to
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
be a commission there should be somebody
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
who's familiar with rowing it and and
 
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
using it uh and uh for the most part
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's not the case and again we'll see
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
that in a moment so that was her main
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
purpose in contacting me and whenever we
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
had this discussion she she asked that I
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
bring it up so
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
it's about all I know at the moment
 
00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:52.609 align:start position:0%
it's about all I know at the moment
right

00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
so just as I'm looking at the analysis
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
um it um
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
they have the bill is we passed it
 
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
simply uh removed the requirements
 
00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
severe pain be resistant to other
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
treatment options as a precursor to
 
00:46:14.109 --> 00:46:14.119 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
use therapeutic therapeutic cannabis and
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
I haven't checked but I assume those are
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
relatively similar
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
the two other things it adds is it adds
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
a commission to study State controlled
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
sales of cannabis and it also prohibits
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
the sale of hemp products containing
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
certain amounts of THC
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:44.780 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues with CBD products
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
is that many of them are not monitors as
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
carefully as they might be so that
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
people wind up ingesting more THC than
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
they thought they were ingesting and
 
00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:01.460 align:start position:0%
they have a right to know
 
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
but I haven't I haven't read through
 
00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:05.579 align:start position:0%
that second part so I don't know exactly
 
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
what the focus is
 
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
I wonder if because we have a lot of
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
moving parts
 
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
with respect to therapeutic cannabis and
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
who is going to be studying what
 
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
um whether this is one that's either
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
better held to the last date for forming
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
Committees of conference or whether we
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
ought to request a committee of
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
conference solely to keep everybody's
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
options open and and communicate to the
 
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
but so that we can actually I mean we
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
don't have to do anything right now and
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
I would I would vote for leaving it
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
until we've had another chance to
 
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:48.500 align:start position:0%
discuss but
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
I know that there are several bills to
 
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
which study committees have either
 
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.670 align:start position:0%
which study committees have either
already

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:47:58.010 --> 00:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
been established or or have been
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
attached so we might want to just put
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
this on for committee of conference just
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:09.380 align:start position:0%
we have a better idea which of the many
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
the commission that they're adding we
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
just finished a very expensive there's
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
been a lot of work done and just
 
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
recently it's worth looking at and I
 
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
think provision three was to build what
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
we heard that came through committee
 
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
maybe last year last session I just
 
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
haven't had a chance to look into it so
 
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:38.300 align:start position:0%
I can certainly provide pronunciation
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
but this is why have a great day thank
 
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:47.870 align:start position:0%
but this is why have a great day thank
you

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
chairman uh looking at it briefly
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the Amendments that the
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
Senate put in they leave the initial two
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
sections that that we have passed about
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
allowing allowing these patients to get
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
the care they need but they added
 
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
essentially a commission to study what
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
the what the governor had put forth is
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
his solution after the Senate shot down
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
the house supported position on
 
00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.630 align:start position:0%
the house supported position on
legalization

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
um and that's a matter of whether or not
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
that study would be a useful study or
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
not that's that's one question and then
 
00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
the other is around these
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
basically what you go into a gas station
 
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
you see and it says it has THC even
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
though it's not the regulated one so it
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
is rather complex
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's uh kind of a shame
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
that all of this has been added on when
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
all we're trying to do is get
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
appropriate care to patients and um I
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
think that there would have been a
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
better Avenue for them to to address
 
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
their concerns as opposed to putting it
 
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:52.220 align:start position:0%
here so I'm a little disappointed
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
yeah Piggyback in on representative Leon
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
it seems a little bit odd that the the
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill deals with therapeutic
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
cannabis and then they've added
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
something to
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
um adult use of cannabis recreational
 
00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.230 align:start position:0%
um adult use of cannabis recreational
use

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and I I don't really know so
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
um it makes it sound like this will be
 
00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
the one vehicle to kind of study the
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
issue when I know that it's been studied
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
endlessly and are there any other
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
current commissions or study committees
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
that this commission overlaps with I
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't really know the answer to that but
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anybody does and this is
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
working on that right now right in terms
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
of further research I believe that
 
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.130 align:start position:0%
of further research I believe that
representative

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
um oh my gosh he did not return
 
00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.150 align:start position:0%
um oh my gosh he did not return
um

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
representative Egan no
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
um so it's abrami excuse me they just
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
finished a commission on cannabis last
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
year and this would repeal the existing
 
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
commission and re-study some of it I
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
also believe that there was a bill that
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
came to the Health and Human Services
 
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
last year tour 2021 about the hemp
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
um provision but I can look more into
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that'd be great thank you
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
the more I listen to this the more I
 
00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:24.140 align:start position:0%
think I would suggest that we just
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
non-concurrent ask for committee of
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
conference right up front so that we can
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
discuss some of these issues and we
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
certainly will have some time to do the
 
00:51:34.809 --> 00:51:34.819 align:start position:0%
research on
 
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me very much like there may
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
be an existing commission that can
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
actually just take this over
 
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.020 align:start position:0%
um I would be loath to just
 
00:51:54.609 --> 00:51:54.619 align:start position:0%
concur without further discussion
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
and I also would be loathed to just let
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
the bill die because I think the two
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
sections that we send over uh were good
 
00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:05.460 align:start position:0%
and useful policy that we all agreed on
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
and I too am
 
00:52:11.089 --> 00:52:11.099 align:start position:0%
sorry that it has other stuff added on
 
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
to it but that's the hand we've been
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
dealt so I think that maybe going and
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking to the senate about it is
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
probably the best the best way to deal
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
with it representative
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
I'm probably in minority but I would
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
recommend concurring uh with this
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
version it still helps the patients and
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
does what we wanted to do just add some
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
studying of safety effects so personally
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
I recommend concurring you recommend
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
concurrent concern
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you Mr
 
00:52:44.099 --> 00:52:45.290 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you Mr
chairman

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:52:48.049 --> 00:52:48.059 align:start position:0%
um correct me but I thought we passed a
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill that said if we're going to have a
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
commission 51 percent of the members
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
have to be legislated to us and
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to do what three or four
 
00:52:59.089 --> 00:52:59.099 align:start position:0%
counts to see if that's true here but
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
having said that I've never seen five
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
Senators show up for anything except you
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
know their their meetings
 
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
denial is not just a river in Egypt uh
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
so I just wondered uh if if this is
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually correctly drawn up it's exactly
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
even exactly even okay thank you I would
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
draw that then but still the question of
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum with so many senators
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
being named is a bit problematic to me
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
having shared these things and not seen
 
00:53:33.309 --> 00:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
Senators show up
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
well representative Glover the the
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
Senate is still only 25 of the
 
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
commission so
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
um even if all the Senators don't show
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
up we have an opportunity for four other
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
members also to be absent
 
00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
um representative Merchant but I'm not
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
sure that the commission is worth doing
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
given the amount of time and energy
 
00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
that's been spent on this and the fact
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
that we had a bill last year
 
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
that was quite similar to this
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
and at the time the governor was not at
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
all receptive
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
um nor was the Senate so
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
one wonders why we bothered to study
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
 
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.530 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant thank you Mr
chair

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
I would say to nanker
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
um possibly committing a conference and
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
my rationale is that this is really kind
 
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.410 align:start position:0%
my rationale is that this is really kind
of

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:31.730 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
dealing with the law exam between the
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate I would much prefer
 
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
to have a study committee comprise the
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
people that are going to look at this
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
and get some sort of concurrence between
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate on a version of
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
a bill we all can live with and
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately pass next year
 
00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
creating this Commission in a lot of
 
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
ways doesn't resolve that and I'm really
 
00:54:56.329 --> 00:54:56.339 align:start position:0%
concerned that there are underlying
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
issues that need to be addressed by the
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate and that seems to
 
00:55:02.809 --> 00:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
be where the Log Jam is I would prefer
 
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
to have a study committee comprised of
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
both Chambers in order to come up with
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
something that both Chambers can support
 
00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon thank you
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that law that we passed
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
limits the the number of people on the
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
commission to 15 with the majority of
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
lawmakers so those numbers would not
 
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.030 align:start position:0%
lawmakers so those numbers would not
work

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:23.750 align:start position:0%
work
um

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
I I do like the idea that if we were
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
going to have something to discuss this
 
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
we perhaps would in committee a
 
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
conference look to a study committee
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
with an appropriate makeup and invite
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and the governor to
 
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
come help with us as well and see where
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
we can get agreement
 
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
um but looking also to um
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
the larger picture there actually is
 
00:55:46.670 --> 00:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
also a non-germain amendment that was
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday in Commerce in order to
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
try and uh Circle the square on cannabis
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
so there may be maybe a solution that
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
may come through this year or at least
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
that gives us another jumping off point
 
00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
to move closer to that agreement so I do
 
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
like this idea potentially having a
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
position of a study committee so that we
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
can actually find an answer find a
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
solution with this legislature this
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
Governor this attorney general and
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
finally get something done on this for
 
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
the people in New Hampshire
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative McLean yeah thank you I
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
mean I I agree with the non-concurrence
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
we sent over a clean bill and I I like
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
the the committee model I mean another
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
thing about the Commission in many
 
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
respects the commission presupposes the
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
outcome of being a state-controlled
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
model which may very well be the way to
 
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
go but if you're going to have a study
 
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:37.730 align:start position:0%
go but if you're going to have a study
commission

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:37.740 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't want to put the car
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
before the horse and say this is what
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
the outcome is going to be so um for all
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
those reasons I think it's wise to not
 
00:56:46.619 --> 00:56:49.130 align:start position:0%
those reasons I think it's wise to not
concur

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.569 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:53.809 --> 00:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
all right I'm hearing the general
 
00:56:57.290 --> 00:56:57.300 align:start position:0%
consensus be none Concur and ask for
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
committee of conference is that correct
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman hand uh
 
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman so
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
just just a a point of information
 
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
because there's been a couple of
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
comments or questions about the the
 
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:11.940 align:start position:0%
composition of the committee
 
00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:14.900 align:start position:0%
um the language in the Senate version
 
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
begins with the phrase or section two of
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
section you know part two of section
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
three notwithstanding RSA 1449 so this
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
is something we're running up again
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
seeing the committee on commissions is
 
00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh this magic phrase notwithstanding RSA
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
1449 essentially says you know the
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
following is not going to conform to to
 
00:57:40.809 --> 00:57:40.819 align:start position:0%
the the statute as it is and those those
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
uh the statute regarding
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
compositional commissions as it is so
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
just point of information
 
00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:49.130 align:start position:0%
just point of information
okay

00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
okay and again basically the what I'm
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
hearing is non-concur with a committee
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
of conference is other than
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative does anyone else have a
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
concerned about that
 
00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
not that we don't appreciate you I will
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
turn into the majority okay all right
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
all right that'll be what I recommend to
 
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
the house then representative thank you
 
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I've done a search to
 
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
find we actually have one other that's
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
been returned but I don't know if we've
 
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
officially received it yet but House
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 642 on the budget flexibility for
 
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
development disabled we're gonna have to
 
00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
take more of a look at it but I just
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
wanted to let everybody know that that
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
one's been returned with an amendment
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I had not heard about that one I
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
just searched it now oh okay when did it
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
when did they amend it was it last week
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
um they amended it last week on the 11th
 
00:58:43.619 --> 00:58:45.770 align:start position:0%
um they amended it last week on the 11th
okay

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.329 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:47.339 --> 00:58:48.349 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
all right that's that's all I know about
 
00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:50.990 align:start position:0%
all right that's that's all I know about
that

00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
um any anything else for the work
 
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
session uh before we've got a couple of
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
minutes before we need to go into
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
all right let's we just asked for a
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes and then we'll return
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to call us back to order uh we
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
are an executive session a little bit
 
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
late I apologize for that uh I'd like to
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
open up the discussion on
 
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 240 and representative
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
merchant do you wish to make a motion
 
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
make a motion to
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
pass Amendment two zero two three
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
one nine five four h well second and
 
01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:47.900 align:start position:0%
representative lay on seconds
 
01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant would you like
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yes it would
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
this bill came to us about a concern a
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
way that the data for genetic testing
 
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
and so forth could be utilized in the
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
clinical care of the patient if you look
 
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
at the statute the way it's written now
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
there is confusion So to avoid the use
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the data within the clinical care of
 
01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
a patient this bill basically addresses
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
that secondly it also addresses the fact
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
that there's a specific consent by the
 
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
patient to release it
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
we had one last hanging issue which is
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with the use of de-identified
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
patient data for clinical research a lot
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
of that came down to is that many times
 
01:13:32.649 --> 01:13:32.659 align:start position:0%
we have information within the system
 
01:13:35.649 --> 01:13:35.659 align:start position:0%
but the system does not have
 
01:13:37.729 --> 01:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
patient-specific information if you
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
identify it's hard to get the patient to
 
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
find out who you have to get the consent
 
01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.470 align:start position:0%
find out who you have to get the consent
from

01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
so instead of trying to tackle all three
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
issues consent use of the data for
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
clinical for the patient care
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
the committee the subcommittee elected
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
to break it apart into two pieces one is
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
to take care of this one for this year
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
take care care of the patient which is
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to get to so the
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
patient can be taken care of and the
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
data can be shared amongst the men
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
members of the clinical team
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
number two the other issue about the
 
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
data itself
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
de-identified and so forth the
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation by the subcommittee to
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
this committee is to then
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
get our group together maybe over the
 
01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:20.689 align:start position:0%
get our group together maybe over the
summer

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
ad hoc if you will and come back with
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
another bill next year to address that
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
issue so fundamentally this bill does
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
two fun two things one identifies
 
01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
specifically patient consent
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
and it allows for
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
the clarifies if you will the use of the
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
data amongst the
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
clinical care team so the data can be
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
shared amongst providers of trying to
 
01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
care for the patient
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I may be
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
really thick but
 
01:14:57.649 --> 01:14:57.659 align:start position:0%
are we saying that there was a there's a
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
currently in statute it says that
 
01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
someone who has genetic testing that the
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
information can't be shared with their
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
medical providers even if they give
 
01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:07.490 align:start position:0%
medical providers even if they give
consent

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
I know that's not relevant to the this
 
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
amendment because this amendment is
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
trying to fix that but is that the case
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're certainly unclear enough I mean I
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
don't think it is the case I don't think
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
it should be the case but it was unclear
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
enough that one of the things that we
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify with the amendment is
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
that the patient can consent to whatever
 
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
the patient wants to consent to the
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
issue came up with respect to I mean
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
we've always enacted statutes to be very
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
careful of people's genetic material and
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
the people it shared with so there was
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
concern that the statute that is now
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
written when you're looking for a
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
clinical trial that might be effective
 
01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
for a particular patient and their
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
designs of them and there are
 
01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:05.270 align:start position:0%
designs of them and there are
clearinghouses

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
clearinghouses
 
01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:09.140 align:start position:0%
um what the statute expressly permits is
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
submitting genetic material for those
 
01:16:12.719 --> 01:16:13.850 align:start position:0%
submitting genetic material for those
studies

01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
studies
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
but it's ridiculous to subject you you
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
have the genetics analyzed once you can
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
send the data it was not entirely clear
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
that the data could be sent
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
um and and I think this just made all of
 
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
us a little on the subcommittee at least
 
01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
a little more comfortable with
 
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
making sure that patients can consent to
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to consent to but
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
that their consent is required thank you
 
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
for that clarification
 
01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
if you had a merchant then
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative Murph thank you Mr chair
 
01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
where the confusion lies is in 141 H2 3.
 
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to paraphrase that no
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
person shall disclose to any other
 
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
person that an individual hasn't
 
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
undergone genetic testing and no
 
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
personal disclose the results of such
 
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
testing to any other person without
 
01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:03.310 align:start position:0%
testing to any other person without
written

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
consent and that's where it got into the
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
gray area that representative Weber is
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
talking about we heard from people their
 
01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
concern was it wasn't clear enough for
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
them to feel that they could actually
 
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
share the most political team that's
 
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
taking care of the patient so we wanted
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:17:23.209 --> 01:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
I appreciate separating these two out
 
01:17:24.649 --> 01:17:24.659 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's the appropriate way
 
01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
um certainly the C refers to the
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
clinical research and you can understand
 
01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
why I mean the clinical care of the
 
01:17:35.689 --> 01:17:35.699 align:start position:0%
patient is different than the research
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
arm that would use the data for other
 
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
purposes perhaps and I think that's
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
important to separate them out section B
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
says that the the analysis and the
 
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.850 align:start position:0%
says that the the analysis and the
testing

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
um can be disclosed to entities that are
 
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
caring for the patient I can understand
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
that as well you may do a procedure here
 
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
but they don't have the the specific
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
protocol in in that institution but they
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
have to go somewhere else they have to
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
share that data so that's important to
 
01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
me as well what I'm trying to my
 
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
question is I guess is
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand it because
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
I understand getting
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
parental consent parental patient
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
consent for you know procedures
 
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
um and what will happen when they have a
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
procedure done as a surgeon what I'm
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
trying to understand is what is referred
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
to as the consenting patient by a
 
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
Clinical Laboratory so
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
if you can explain to me I'm just trying
 
01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
to understand what is the definition of
 
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
consenting of a consenting patient are
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
they consenting for the say a biopsy are
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
they consenting for a buckle smear are
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
they consenting for a laboratory study
 
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
only or are they consenting to doing a
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
procedure taking a test and then
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
in that same consent is that also
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
implied that they can use that data for
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
entities outside the provider where it
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
was taken to help in the treatment of
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
the patient is that I'm trying to our
 
01:18:58.689 --> 01:18:58.699 align:start position:0%
our intent was
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
to allow for the broadest use once a
 
01:19:06.370 --> 01:19:06.380 align:start position:0%
patient has consented to Broad use
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
to share it as widely as possible to
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
enable trials to be to come up
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh we didn't want to be too specific
 
01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.390 align:start position:0%
uh we didn't want to be too specific
about

01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
how that worked uh in the discussions
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
that we had and I'll defer to the others
 
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:26.940 align:start position:0%
if they feel differently because this is
 
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
just my perception but uh the sticking
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
point for us was the addition of
 
01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.729 align:start position:0%
point for us was the addition of
de-identified

01:19:36.729 --> 01:19:36.739 align:start position:0%
de-identified
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
uh material being used for people doing
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
retrospective studies to find out
 
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:48.420 align:start position:0%
how effective a particular treatment had
 
01:19:51.649 --> 01:19:51.659 align:start position:0%
been and the thing that we were
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
grappling with and simply felt we had no
 
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
time to do it successfully or
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully is the more you de-identify
 
01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:05.219 align:start position:0%
data the less useful it is in terms of
 
01:20:05.219 --> 01:20:09.610 align:start position:0%
data the less useful it is in terms of
uh

01:20:09.610 --> 01:20:09.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
pinpointing which members of a
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
particular population may be more the
 
01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
treatment may be more effective for so
 
01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.030 align:start position:0%
treatment may be more effective for so
or

01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
pinpointing other issues that might
 
01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
affect the results so
 
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
um we just didn't feel like we could
 
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
deal with that and that actually was a
 
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
piece that was
 
01:20:33.709 --> 01:20:33.719 align:start position:0%
tacked onto the original bill which was
 
01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
all about clinical treatment so
 
01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
we did not grapple
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
with the absolute specifics of stuff
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
what we were really focusing on was
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
allowing a patient to consent
 
01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
to whatever a patient wanted to consent
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
to because like representative Shapiro's
 
01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
first question uh a lot of us sitting
 
01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
here were really startled to find out
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
that a patient couldn't give effective
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
consent or that there was a concern
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
about patients giving effective consent
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
to certain things
 
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
so can I call it so if I could give a
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
concrete example and again I I agree
 
01:21:16.669 --> 01:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
with this and I would like to have it go
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
forward and I I'm just trying to
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
understand consent so for instance if I
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
had a consent for a procedure it's
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
listed what would happen you know
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
potentially anything from a great
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
success to a death you know and anything
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
in between in people that would
 
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
participate in a procedure or not
 
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
um uh that sort of thing infection etc
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
etc so my question is
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
how do you protect or how do you assuage
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
those concerned about having a broad
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
stroke for consent when you deal with
 
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
the genetic testing or analysis that
 
01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:53.219 align:start position:0%
says okay I'm trying to understand this
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
if I had a somebody in my family had a
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
bracket gene they said I just want to
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
know if I have that Gene but I don't
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
want that shared for protection of my
 
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
siblings and my children for insurance
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
purposes or otherwise how is that
 
01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
assured that that information is not you
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
know widely dispersed to the point where
 
01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
it could potentially harm or influence
 
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
the care of a sibling or family member
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
representative way I think oh I'm sorry
 
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um if you look
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
at the larger part of the 141-8 which is
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
about genetic testing we're talking
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
about just the conditions of genetic
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
testing section three is the use of
 
01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
genetic testing and employment situation
 
01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
section four is in health insurance and
 
01:22:37.970 --> 01:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
section 5 is in life disability income
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
disability income and long-term care
 
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
insurance it prohibits that use for
 
01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
anybody so that we don't get that
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination based upon your genetic
 
01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
discrimination based upon your genetic
testing

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and part of this as well you're
 
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:51.260 align:start position:0%
talking about that overall consent
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
if you're coerced to do it if the only
 
01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
way you can get the genetic testing is
 
01:22:57.169 --> 01:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
to share your data now and forever
 
01:22:59.450 --> 01:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's not consent that's acquiescence
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
and it's very different there are some
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
Cancer Centers where they pay for your
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
genetic testing and if you consent for
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
them to pay for it they're able to use
 
01:23:09.649 --> 01:23:09.659 align:start position:0%
your data in the ways that they spell
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
out with the IRB so they're doing a lot
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
of great research there but they're also
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
fronting that money to pay for that
 
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
genetic research and with that exchange
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
it does make sense so we were just
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that that genetic
 
01:23:23.689 --> 01:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
retrospect that retrospective research
 
01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
which is not clinical research because
 
01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
it's not based upon the specific patient
 
01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
but is more population based that that
 
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
has appropriate treatment because the
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
people who had come and testified wanted
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to to access this information
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
as broadly as possible because the more
 
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:41.540 align:start position:0%
data you use the better your conclusions
 
01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
but the medical records belong to the
 
01:23:46.490 --> 01:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
patient not to the institution and so
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
that balance is going to take a lot more
 
01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
than we could do here we have the
 
01:23:52.729 --> 01:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
pressing need that to match somebody to
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
a clinical trial or find another
 
01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
provider that's offering especially for
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
a rare disease you can't just go through
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
the clinicaltrials.gov and try and
 
01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
search for those it's just too
 
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
cumbersome so there's Clearing Houses
 
01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
and that is the biggest part about
 
01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
section B is to be able to disclose it
 
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
for the entities participating in the
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
clinical care which are those
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
clearinghouses that try and match these
 
01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:15.060 align:start position:0%
patients with those promising treatments
 
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
especially because we're seeing such a
 
01:24:19.130 --> 01:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
proliferation of treatments for these
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
rare diseases but nobody can say on top
 
01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
of it I mean you have you have all the
 
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
different institutions you have it for
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
obstetrics and gynecologic cancers you
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
have ACOG then you have others so you
 
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
need to be able to reach out into all of
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
these and we need computers so and yes
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
representative McLean and and to ask
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
answer your specific question about
 
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
limiting the uses you can always limit
 
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
the uses as well I mean you're going to
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
have to read the form and say well gee I
 
01:24:48.890 --> 01:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
don't want all of this or you're going
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
to have to tell your care provider look
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
I want to know this for myself I want to
 
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
be darn sure that my
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
siblings my Offspring don't get this and
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
and they're not allowed to share it
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
anyway I mean that's just basic you
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
can't share it with anybody who isn't
 
01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
Under the Umbrella of what you've
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
already consented to so
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I I think patients
 
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
for I I will
 
01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
I mean from the patient perspective and
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
also from the perspective somebody who
 
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
sat here and listened to patients a lot
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
they come in two varieties some people
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
go in and say sure I'll consent to
 
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
whatever you think I need to consent to
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
give me the forms and take them away
 
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
again and then you have patients who are
 
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
very very careful and thorough about
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
what they can send to because it's very
 
01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
important to them and they won't sign
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
blanket consents they will put limits on
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
them but
 
01:25:53.689 --> 01:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
our whole focus in the approach that we
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
adopted was to leave the control with
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't answer for instance
 
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
about they've done this and they've done
 
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
this I will say that we did have
 
01:26:10.729 --> 01:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
involved in the negotiations there was a
 
01:26:14.890 --> 01:26:14.900 align:start position:0%
clinician who uh from Dartmouth medical
 
01:26:17.649 --> 01:26:17.659 align:start position:0%
who vetted the language
 
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
and helped us with the language so there
 
01:26:23.330 --> 01:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
was a clinical perspective involved in
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative McLean and then
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant yeah thank you
 
01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
Miss Jaren I I sat in on one of the work
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
sessions just watched everybody so I
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
thought everybody did a really awesome
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
job the one question I have you know
 
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
kind of gets back to representative
 
01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:41.219 align:start position:0%
Weber's comments about you know blanket
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
consent versus non-blankit consent
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
um and the nature of the consenting
 
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
patient so we see
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
um Gene testing it's really evolving so
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
let's just say for example at some point
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
in the future I'll just kind of role
 
01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:57.780 align:start position:0%
play a little bit if I had rheumatoid
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
arthritis and and I'm so my treating
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
physician case is working with me and
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
maybe trying to develop treatments with
 
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
me so if at some point my treating
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
position decides I'd really like to have
 
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
Mark go in and have genetic testing done
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
because we have all these things with
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
rheumatoid arthritis and if if I just
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
really wasn't comfortable for whatever
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
reason with that kind of testing with
 
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
this language as it's written allow me
 
01:27:30.169 --> 01:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
to say no that's something I I don't
 
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
want because it says on the C-section it
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
says specific informed consent so I'm
 
01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
just kind of wondering how that kind of
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
would play out
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant and thank you Mr
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Richmond McLean
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
also in the statute if you go back and
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
look at section two there's a line in
 
01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
here it says no person shall refuse to
 
01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:52.430 align:start position:0%
here it says no person shall refuse to
perform

01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
perform
 
01:27:54.290 --> 01:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
genetic testing or to arrange for
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
genetic testing to be performed or do
 
01:27:58.010 --> 01:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
business within with an individual
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
solely because the individual to be
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
tested refuses
 
01:28:04.129 --> 01:28:04.139 align:start position:0%
refuses to consent
 
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
to provide tough results to any other
 
01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:07.610 align:start position:0%
to provide tough results to any other
person

01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
so if you don't want those results to go
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere else you have that right that's
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
why if you look at the way it's written
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
it allows for it only when it's
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
specified within the consent form so the
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
consent form is what's driving this if
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
the patient ultimately consents to it
 
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
whatever they consent to is what's
 
01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:26.219 align:start position:0%
allowed if the patient does consent it's
 
01:28:28.209 --> 01:28:28.219 align:start position:0%
not allowed thank you very much
 
01:28:30.050 --> 01:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative profile did you have your
 
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
I did thank you Mr chairman so I guess I
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
would just point out that genetic
 
01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.050 align:start position:0%
would just point out that genetic
um

01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
genetic information by its very nature
 
01:28:39.490 --> 01:28:39.500 align:start position:0%
cannot be
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
de-identified unless you start to break
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
down a patient's Gene sequence and only
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
share parts of it so
 
01:28:49.129 --> 01:28:49.139 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
privacy implications associated with
 
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
sharing genetic data that perhaps don't
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
apply to other forms of of information
 
01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.490 align:start position:0%
apply to other forms of of information
um

01:29:01.490 --> 01:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
um I guess in in an Ideal World I would
 
01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
like to see a a kind of uh consent
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
reversal process similar to what Europe
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
has instituted with GPR having said that
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we're going to solve
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
that problem today
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm in agreement with
 
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative Weber that you know there
 
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
is a there is there is a consent form it

we all understand that the consent is
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
patient driven and not taken away from

discussed it plenty but I would uh
 
01:31:55.689 --> 01:31:55.699 align:start position:0%
request that the drafter of the report
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
make it very clear in specific language
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
that it is the intent of
 
01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
that the intent of the bill is to ensure
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount of control for a
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
patient over their medical decisions and
 
01:32:17.689 --> 01:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
uh you know I can't draft it in my head
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
like that but I if if we have a
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
statement about intent in the blurb it
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
will it will be helpful to bankrupt so
 
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
ever I would more than glad to share
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%

hi good morning I'm Stephanie Patrick
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm the chair of the quality Council
 
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
and also the executive director of
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center
 
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
I just want to say on you know on behalf
 
01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
of the area agencies we feel that
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
there was obviously a lot of discussion
 
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
in this committee on this legislation
 
01:35:36.910 --> 01:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
exactly House Bill 238 relative to the
 
01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:42.179 align:start position:0%
uh quality Council developmental
 
01:35:44.689 --> 01:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
Services quality Council you may recall
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
at the hearing there was a lot of
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
concern that families and Advocates and
 
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
providers didn't feel included in a lot
 
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
of the decisions that were made by the
 
01:35:55.129 --> 01:35:55.139 align:start position:0%
department and so this bill was clearly
 
01:35:58.010 --> 01:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
a result of that concern out in the
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
community around the state so
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon who has long been
 
01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:04.020 align:start position:0%
a champion of Developmental services in
 
01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
the state brought forward this
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
legislation and the air agencies did
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
support it when it came over to the
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
Senate there was a lot of concern just
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
for your information this this
 
01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
legislation did not go to the Health and
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
Human Services Committee in the Senate
 
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
it actually went to the executive
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
departments and administration the Edna
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee largely because of the the
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
Contracting components that were in the
 
01:36:27.050 --> 01:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
legislation and there was a lot of
 
01:36:30.530 --> 01:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
concern particularly by uh some of the
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
leadership on the committee that uh
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
because of the the procurement rules and
 
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
legal issues around fairness in terms of
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
how State contracts are awarded that um
 
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
they were not comfortable with a lot of
 
01:36:46.129 --> 01:36:46.139 align:start position:0%
the language that was in the building
 
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
you might recall that you actually
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
scaled back some of that language as
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
well in terms of how it was introduced
 
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
so we had an initial amendment that was
 
01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
uh presented largely written by the
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
department and the area agencies and and
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
the DRC and other Advocates did push
 
01:37:03.169 --> 01:37:03.179 align:start position:0%
back on that Amendment because I I
 
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
personally felt that it was sort of a
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
toothless tiger that was not not a lot
 
01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
of meaningful change that was part of
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
that Amendment we went back to the
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
drawing board came up with I think a
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
good amendment that requires uh at a
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
minimum quarterly dialogue between the
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
council and the department the
 
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
department has to respond in writing and
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of detailed uh information
 
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
that they can't just uh respond with you
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
know one sentence it has to be in
 
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
writing there has to be uh detailed
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
explanations about why they're making
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
the decisions that they are so I think
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill just to summarize uh is
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
going to improve communication between
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability Community
 
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
the providers the families uh and and
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
The Advocates like like the DRC so I I
 
01:37:51.649 --> 01:37:51.659 align:start position:0%
guess just to summarize not to speak for
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
others but the department the the
 
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
providers and groups like the disability
 
01:37:58.189 --> 01:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
rights Center which are advocacy
 
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
organizations that don't provide
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
services but represent individuals and
 
01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
families in the system to make sure that
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
they're treated fairly and receive the
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
services that they need all of the
 
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
groups were able to come together after
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh additional amendments in
 
01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
the Senate to come to a conclusion that
 
01:38:19.490 --> 01:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
we were all able to support this bill so
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's probably three quarters of
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
a loaf and we're just concerned that if
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
you ask for a committee a conference I
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how much more the Senate
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
would give on this so it's probably best
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
to take the three quarters of the loaf
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
and and not risk this bill being
 
01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
defeated or even the Senate may be
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
non-concurrent because I don't think
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of
 
01:38:41.330 --> 01:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
appetite to go to go back to the
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
Contracting issues I think there there
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
are some concerns there so we don't want
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
to risk a lot of the good work that was
 
01:38:50.090 --> 01:38:50.100 align:start position:0%
done so I'll turn it over to um the DRC
 
01:38:52.729 --> 01:38:52.739 align:start position:0%
unless there's other questions
 
01:38:52.739 --> 01:38:57.310 align:start position:0%
unless there's other questions
foreign

01:38:57.310 --> 01:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you yep so I just wanted to be
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
clear the quali one of the things that
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses is that some
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
problems that quality Council has had
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
with making sure that people with
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities and family members can
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
participate in the council
 
01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
um we faced that issue last week at the
 
01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
scheduled quality council meeting so
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
we're not able to hold an official
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
meeting so we did not we did not take an
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
official vote on the position on this
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
bill and so I can't speak for the
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
quality Council as a whole as in terms
 
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
of disability rights Center I agree with
 
01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:25.010 align:start position:0%
of disability rights Center I agree with
Alex

01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
Alex
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that it while there is still
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
room to improve the process this bill as
 
01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
it stands as amended by the Senate does
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
put us in a much better place to be able
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
to address the concerns the quality
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
Council had you know I've talked to
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon and he's very
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
open to additional legislation if that's
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
needed if this process isn't working in
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of years or at least he was
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
when I talked to him a couple of weeks
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
ago and so I agree I I think as as
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative DRC and a member of the
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
quality Council I would say that this is
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
a good comprehend that address some of
 
01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
the concerns the department raised and
 
01:40:00.169 --> 01:40:00.179 align:start position:0%
I'm equally as concerned as Alex that we
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
will run into problems getting it back
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
through the Senate if it changes much
 
01:40:06.110 --> 01:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
okay questions representative Shapiro
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:40:08.159 --> 01:40:08.890 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:40:08.890 --> 01:40:08.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:11.930 --> 01:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
I think both of you coming would kind of
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
sway my vote on this but I'll just ask
 
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
um since so much of the discussion that
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
happened in our initial hearing involve
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
the Consultants that were hired and do
 
01:40:26.930 --> 01:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
did do a report and um and that people
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
in the disabilities Community felt like
 
01:40:30.310 --> 01:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
they were not
 
01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
consulted and did not have a say in that
 
01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:34.570 align:start position:0%
consulted and did not have a say in that
um

01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:34.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
so what I'm hearing you say that you
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
that there are other good things in this
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill and you're well willing to let go
 
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
of the involvement in the Contracting
 
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
I think so I mean I think that you know
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
the the bill sets up in process so that
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
we have quarterly dialogues with the
 
01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
department and so I think if if a
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
contract that the department was
 
01:40:59.330 --> 01:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
considering or that they had implemented
 
01:41:01.070 --> 01:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
was part of the concerns of the quality
 
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
Council there's no restriction on
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
putting that into that letter and then
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
invoking this process that's outlined to
 
01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
have conversations with it in that way
 
01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
at least I mean I think you know
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
originally the council members really
 
01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
wanted to be more of a a voice during
 
01:41:17.330 --> 01:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
that process
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
I think that would be ideal but I do
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
think that there would be a way to have
 
01:41:23.090 --> 01:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
those kinds of conversations either in
 
01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
writing or at quality Council meetings
 
01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
even about contracts
 
01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
um you know just be a little bit
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
different it may be a little slower
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:35.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I'm trying to
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
look at this it seems like there are
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
changes Beyond just the Contracting so
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
there are other changes that are
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
happening if it
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
I guess I I frankly would be
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
disappointed if there were concerns
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
about places beyond the Contracting and
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
the Senate wouldn't come to the table if
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
we were willing to budge on the
 
01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
Contracting issue but still had other
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
concerns for these differences so um
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
is that something where where are the
 
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
other changes have been meaningful or
 
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
those ones that you're just willing to
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
accede to
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
I guess you're willing to accede to all
 
01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
of it so I guess that's not a question I
 
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
mean I I think that the the process is
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
much more detailed than it was in terms
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
of feedback from the council you know
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
there um now there's a limit of
 
01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:20.699 align:start position:0%
quarterly to invoke this process that
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
you can see outlined in the Senate
 
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
version of the bill
 
01:42:25.129 --> 01:42:25.139 align:start position:0%
um in terms of you know we didn't
 
01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
outline it just that if the council
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
sends a letter to the department
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
um with concerns the department has to
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
respond in writing within 30 days and
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
now there's a process of coming to a
 
01:42:37.129 --> 01:42:37.139 align:start position:0%
meeting and having a discussion
 
01:42:37.139 --> 01:42:38.030 align:start position:0%
meeting and having a discussion
um

01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
I think we'll have to see if that is
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
better it's definitely more detailed
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
than it was in the house version
 
01:42:48.850 --> 01:42:48.860 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that generally
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
conversations are more productive
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes than letters back and forth
 
01:42:55.970 --> 01:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
um to really make sure that the concerns
 
01:42:59.090 --> 01:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
if are being addressed we've seen that
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the I've seen that in the quality
 
01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
council's comments on roles now that we
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
have a member of the department who sits
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
in on the rules committee meetings where
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
we go over the kind of detailed concerns
 
01:43:10.129 --> 01:43:10.139 align:start position:0%
about that I think it's made the conver
 
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
the Department's understanding of the
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
quality council is concerned richer
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
um you know I like I said I mean if it's
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
if we're running up against a limit and
 
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
frustrations that once a quarter is not
 
01:43:25.609 --> 01:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
sufficient I think we could revisit that
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
in the future I mean last year we sent
 
01:43:29.450 --> 01:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
them four four formal letters with
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
concerns um
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
so if following that track I think we
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
would be okay
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
would you believe that after the last
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
discussion on this legislation I was
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
very disturbed
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
by a long-standing concern
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
about protecting the DD population
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
so I went ahead and
 
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
formulated a request to the
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
oversight Committee of Health and Human
 
01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.189 align:start position:0%
oversight Committee of Health and Human
Services

01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:44:14.890 --> 01:44:14.900 align:start position:0%
whose our former chair and present chair
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
of the oversight committee has that
 
01:44:18.719 --> 01:44:20.169 align:start position:0%
of the oversight committee has that
application

01:44:20.169 --> 01:44:20.179 align:start position:0%
application
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm convinced because I know
 
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
a few people very well
 
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
that you're content with what has
 
01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:31.430 align:start position:0%
that you're content with what has
resulted

01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
resulted
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we need to proceed with
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
but that opportunity is there
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
and it's a opportunity I think that
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
works extremely well the chairman
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
actually has chaired two of those
 
01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittees himself
 
01:44:56.510 --> 01:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
so that opportunity is there but I would
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
consider that we are now withdrawing
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
that request
 
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
here's one of the things that's my
 
01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:10.189 align:start position:0%
here's one of the things that's my
concern

01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
um in Roman numeral four I was looking
 
01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
at the language you said you know they
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
were going to meet quarterly but the
 
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
now I've lost it again
 
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:25.850 align:start position:0%
now I've lost it again
um

01:45:25.850 --> 01:45:25.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
it says no more frequently than no more
 
01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
frequently than quarterly so
 
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
the concern that that raises for me I
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
was thought when you were outlining it
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about a at a
 
01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
minimum quarterly as opposed to no more
 
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
frequently than quarterly my concern
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
with this language and you know we we
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
can certainly I I'm perfectly willing to
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
let go of the
 
01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
Contracting stuff I understand what the
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
problems are of that but if you agree to
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
saying you're going to raise your
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
concerns no more frequently than
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
quarterly if you've just had your
 
01:46:09.290 --> 01:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
quarterly meeting and something comes up
 
01:46:11.629 --> 01:46:11.639 align:start position:0%
the next week that is terribly
 
01:46:15.250 --> 01:46:15.260 align:start position:0%
concerning to
 
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
the community
 
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
you have foreclosed any opportunity to
 
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
do anything about it for another three
 
01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:26.169 align:start position:0%
do anything about it for another three
months

01:46:26.169 --> 01:46:26.179 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:27.850 align:start position:0%
months
so

01:46:27.850 --> 01:46:27.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:31.850 --> 01:46:31.860 align:start position:0%
that is a real concern to me and I see
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
represent I see that Mr Williams is
 
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
making faces in the back there so
 
01:46:39.410 --> 01:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
perhaps he disagrees with me but there's
 
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
only one way I can read the words no
 
01:46:44.209 --> 01:46:44.219 align:start position:0%
more frequently than quarterly it means
 
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
no more frequently than quarterly and
 
01:46:50.689 --> 01:46:50.699 align:start position:0%
that is of concern to me and I wonder if
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
it's of concern to you as well
 
01:46:55.129 --> 01:46:55.139 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you Mr
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
chairman no more frequently than
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
quarterly officially
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
but I do think the department knows from
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
all of the activity we've been doing
 
01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
that we want to keep ongoing
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
conversations and I think nothing here
 
01:47:12.010 --> 01:47:12.020 align:start position:0%
would preclude an informal Chit Chat
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
certainly nothing would preclude us
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
coming back with more next year if that
 
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
was necessary or nothing would preclude
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
us firing up the subcommittee
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative McKay had brought at one
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
point I don't think that no more than
 
01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
quarterly shuts off all discussion back
 
01:47:36.010 --> 01:47:36.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
so right now they don't have to respond
 
01:47:40.729 --> 01:47:40.739 align:start position:0%
the quarterly limit is really about
 
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
their responding to what the quality
 
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
council is is asking or raising as a
 
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
concern right now they don't have to
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
respond at all
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
right nothing that required so at least
 
01:47:53.530 --> 01:47:53.540 align:start position:0%
this gives us quarterly
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know meaty I call it Media or
 
01:47:58.370 --> 01:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
meaningful feedback from the Department
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
that they can't just ignore and say that
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't get the letter not that
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
that's really happening but I I've heard
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
that it that it could be happening you
 
01:48:06.770 --> 01:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
know that they don't feel that they're
 
01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
getting a a meaningful dialogue so this
 
01:48:11.930 --> 01:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
this requires quarterly feedback and
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
meaningful dialogue and in addition to
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
that the bill that's amended by the
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
Senate if you look at Roman five there
 
01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
are exceptions uh for administrative
 
01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
rules regulations proposals or other
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
initiatives impacting quality so those
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
issues would not be subject to the
 
01:48:30.410 --> 01:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
quarterly limit and that was put in um
 
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
as a request of uh Stephanie Patrick in
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate and they were that was
 
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
actually the third amendment in
 
01:48:39.290 --> 01:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
committee that they considered because
 
01:48:41.450 --> 01:48:41.460 align:start position:0%
exactly the point that you're raising
 
01:48:43.129 --> 01:48:43.139 align:start position:0%
representative Weber so I think I want
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
to speak for Stephanie but I think that
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
gives her a little more comfort that uh
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
many of the issues that are talked about
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis will not be subject
 
01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
to the quarterly limitation I'm I I
 
01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
didn't see that because
 
01:49:00.410 --> 01:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
so I would that gives me a certain
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
amount more Comfort my concern was when
 
01:49:04.250 --> 01:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
you say no more frequently than
 
01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:05.810 align:start position:0%
you say no more frequently than
quarterly

01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:07.550 align:start position:0%
quarterly
um

01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:10.729 --> 01:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
I I am
 
01:49:12.530 --> 01:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
in entirely agreement with
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson about the
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
informal Communications
 
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and but
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
first of all informal communication
 
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't seem to work before and
 
01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:26.050 align:start position:0%
certainly didn't seem to work before and
um

01:49:26.050 --> 01:49:26.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
while we have Earnest representations
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
from the Department that they want to do
 
01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.430 align:start position:0%
from the Department that they want to do
better

01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
changes could happen in the department
 
01:49:38.410 --> 01:49:38.420 align:start position:0%
so I like having it in statute
 
01:49:41.890 --> 01:49:41.900 align:start position:0%
pointing out the provisions in
 
01:49:46.609 --> 01:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
Roman 5 make me feel considerably more
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the quarterly
 
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
restriction so
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
I guess I've been talked around to being
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
willing if it's the will of the
 
01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee to change my position on
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
requesting a committee of conference
 
01:50:02.689 --> 01:50:02.699 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:50:06.890 --> 01:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
chairman I guess my question is if um if
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
the council comments on those changes
 
01:50:10.609 --> 01:50:10.619 align:start position:0%
and rules regulation proposals or other
 
01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
initiatives is the department with the
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
requirement Department how to written
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
response is there any requests that the
 
01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
department would respond with a written
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
response or perhaps would that be that
 
01:50:24.109 --> 01:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
last last inch that we need to reach
 
01:50:24.119 --> 01:50:25.729 align:start position:0%
last last inch that we need to reach
agreement

01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:50:27.649 --> 01:50:27.659 align:start position:0%
because that doesn't seem to me that
 
01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
they can comment but there doesn't need
 
01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
to be a response I guess I'm curious if
 
01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
there's any follow-up there I mean they
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
do have as Stephanie said they do have a
 
01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative on the council so
 
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
hopefully there would be dialogue there
 
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
uh and you know as representative Weber
 
01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
said you know the intention is that they
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
hopefully through this process they've
 
01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
come to the understanding that uh there
 
01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
was a problem here and that they will be
 
01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:49.619 align:start position:0%
more responsive but you're right
 
01:50:51.590 --> 01:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative there's I guess you're
 
01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
right the way I read it there's no
 
01:50:54.530 --> 01:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
necessarily requirement that they
 
01:50:57.169 --> 01:50:57.179 align:start position:0%
provide a formal written response under
 
01:50:59.629 --> 01:50:59.639 align:start position:0%
Roman five uh you know the same way that
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
they would have to under the quarterly
 
01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:02.330 align:start position:0%
they would have to under the quarterly
requirement

01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
I I guess as a follow-up to that I I'll
 
01:51:07.070 --> 01:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
back off on most of it but I still would
 
01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
want to see a committee of conference
 
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
even if it's just adding that line to
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
and request a written response and
 
01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
backing off on the rest a lot of the
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
rest of it
 
01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:17.649 align:start position:0%
rest of it
representative

01:51:17.649 --> 01:51:17.659 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
hi thank you um I just have a wondering
 
01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh because to me no more than quarterly
 
01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.890 align:start position:0%
uh because to me no more than quarterly
means

01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:51:28.010 --> 01:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
never once a year like what where is
 
01:51:30.649 --> 01:51:30.659 align:start position:0%
there a minimum or a specified required
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
I think I don't think there is a minimum
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
I mean I think that would be at the will
 
01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the council you know the council that
 
01:51:49.010 --> 01:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
would give the council the ability to
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
invoke this process as it's outlined as
 
01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
it seats fit which I think is what we
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
thought that that was the intention so
 
01:51:59.930 --> 01:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
the council would
 
01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
send in my understanding of the process
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
the council would discuss an issue at a
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
meeting and develop a letter that
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
reflects the council's concerns on
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
whatever it is it could be we do this
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
once a quarter and we capture everything
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we've been worried about over that
 
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
quarter or we we well the council will
 
01:52:18.490 --> 01:52:18.500 align:start position:0%
have to decide how it would manage that
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
we'd send the letter we would make it
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
clear that we're invoking the process
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's outlined in that in section four
 
01:52:28.129 --> 01:52:28.139 align:start position:0%
and then then we would we would invoke
 
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
it then I mean I
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
there may be times when the council does
 
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
not feel the need to invoke the formal
 
01:52:38.030 --> 01:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
process because the conversations have
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
been productive enough we want to
 
01:52:42.410 --> 01:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
require us to do that or require the
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
department to do that if it wasn't
 
01:52:43.679 --> 01:52:47.209 align:start position:0%
department to do that if it wasn't
needed

01:52:47.209 --> 01:52:47.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.609 --> 01:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
another discussion
 
01:52:52.729 --> 01:52:52.739 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh yes representative Bertrand
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you I want to follow up on to the
 
01:52:58.370 --> 01:52:58.380 align:start position:0%
comments one is in regards to the
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
frequency in which things are meeting if
 
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
you will I understand the issue seems to
 
01:53:05.149 --> 01:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
be communication between the agencies
 
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
and the department but who is calling
 
01:53:09.709 --> 01:53:09.719 align:start position:0%
these meetings is it the department or
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
the agencies themselves because I'm
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about it the Department's
 
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
calling it and they only have to do it
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
no more than quarterly that they could
 
01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
do it six months there's nothing in here
 
01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.390 align:start position:0%
do it six months there's nothing in here
zero

01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
which following up exactly to your point
 
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
and the number two I do have a concern
 
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
if you go back and look on page four
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
it goes back to the frequency of the
 
01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:36.770 align:start position:0%
it goes back to the frequency of the
meetings

01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
if you submit something's recommendation
 
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
and then the department sends back a
 
01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
response saying well geez we didn't have
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
time to get to it for all these reasons
 
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
he meeting every quarterly that's a
 
01:53:49.370 --> 01:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
six-month time frame
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
so if we're really trying to act on
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
things as recommendations from the
 
01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.290 align:start position:0%
things as recommendations from the
council

01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:53:55.970 --> 01:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
where is there anything in the statute
 
01:53:57.590 --> 01:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
that requires a the frequency of the
 
01:53:59.810 --> 01:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
meetings and B that there's some action
 
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
taken at some point in time and actually
 
01:54:04.669 --> 01:54:04.679 align:start position:0%
keep kicking the can down the road
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
so as the as exists in the another part
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
of the legislation the changes that you
 
01:54:12.350 --> 01:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
saw the the chair of the council the
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
vice chair the the
 
01:54:16.370 --> 01:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
um commissioner or his or her designee
 
01:54:19.129 --> 01:54:19.139 align:start position:0%
can call meetings of the council we
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
traditionally meet monthly
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
um although we occasionally can meet on
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
an emergency basis
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that but we have a
 
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
it's down at the bottom
 
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you Mr
 
01:54:34.020 --> 01:54:35.270 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson thank you Mr
chairman

01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.350 align:start position:0%
chairman
um

01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:38.209 --> 01:54:38.219 align:start position:0%
as some of you know I've been behind the
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
scenes on this for quite a while
 
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
and let me just say I am very encouraged
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
by the Department's response we're not
 
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
at the finish line yet but not only are
 
01:54:53.090 --> 01:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
we not where we were we're moving in the
 
01:54:56.649 --> 01:54:56.659 align:start position:0%
right direction and I don't see
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
the department being
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
indifferent or hostile and if they are
 
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
we can always have another bill or we
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
can crank up a subcommittee I give I'd
 
01:55:10.010 --> 01:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
take the win and I'd give them a
 
01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:12.890 align:start position:0%
take the win and I'd give them a
compliment

01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
a sort of digressing for a second but we
 
01:55:20.169 --> 01:55:20.179 align:start position:0%
also have a retain Bill 603 I'm sorry
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
608 which deals with a pilot is that an
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to dive deeper into
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
the Contracting side of the equation
 
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
during that subcommittee and the retain
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
bill so we can break them apart once
 
01:55:34.669 --> 01:55:34.679 align:start position:0%
dealing with communication one's dealing
 
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
with Contracting we can get the
 
01:55:37.609 --> 01:55:37.619 align:start position:0%
communication part so it's going forward
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
but still have a way in a vehicle to
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
talk about the Contracting side yeah
 
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
yeah of course thank you you can take my
 
01:55:49.149 --> 01:55:49.159 align:start position:0%
seat please we need a bigger table
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
sure sure are a smaller uh legislative
 
01:55:54.649 --> 01:55:54.659 align:start position:0%
director so
 
01:55:57.530 --> 01:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
um there is already in existence a state
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
procurement committee and I would
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
suggest that if you are studying the
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
issue of procurement it should go
 
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
through that already established
 
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.270 align:start position:0%
through that already established
committee

01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
I do understand also that house bill 608
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
was retained specifically for the
 
01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
purpose as a vehicle for additional
 
01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
legislation be it whatever it might be
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
also the department has honored although
 
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
not part of a legislative proposal a
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
monthly or on every single regular
 
01:56:25.490 --> 01:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
meeting of the HHS oversight to
 
01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
providing an update uh to to that
 
01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:29.149 align:start position:0%
providing an update uh to to that
committee

01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:56:32.169 --> 01:56:32.179 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
I just note that if we were going to
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
draft that kind of an amendment to 608
 
01:56:39.169 --> 01:56:39.179 align:start position:0%
it would need to be the subject of a a
 
01:56:39.179 --> 01:56:41.149 align:start position:0%
it would need to be the subject of a a
non-germane

01:56:41.149 --> 01:56:41.159 align:start position:0%
non-germane
 
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
a non-germaine Amendment hearing because
 
01:56:47.649 --> 01:56:47.659 align:start position:0%
it's not close enough to the original
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
intent there but we've got plenty of
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:57:01.310 --> 01:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
I think as well as that thank you thank
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity thank you
 
01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%
thank you for the information
 
01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
well having heard all of that is there
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
still opposition then To None concur or
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.890 --> 01:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
I've heard generally still none
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
I having
 
01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
am willing willing to back off on
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
non-concur and request a committee of
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
conference but I I would love to hear
 
01:57:36.589 --> 01:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
how other committee members feel about
 
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
I can certainly see reasons for going
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
either way and I I do concur with
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's concerns
 
01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:53.219 align:start position:0%
so I think the question is whether we
 
01:57:55.070 --> 01:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
proceed with the half a low for three
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
quarters of a loaf and then
 
01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
um perhaps do some more work get this
 
01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:03.709 align:start position:0%
um perhaps do some more work get this
part

01:58:03.709 --> 01:58:03.719 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
what I see is helpful is maybe getting
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
this part into statute and then taking
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
advantage of uh retained Bill 608 if we
 
01:58:15.669 --> 01:58:15.679 align:start position:0%
need to make further changes
 
01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
those changes will be acted on in
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
January and go over to the Senate and
 
01:58:23.689 --> 01:58:23.699 align:start position:0%
you know there will be a whole nother
 
01:58:26.750 --> 01:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
round of negotiations or or
 
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
non-negotiations but at least we would
 
01:58:31.609 --> 01:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
have this much in the statute and that
 
01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
would be I think a step in the right
 
01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:34.209 align:start position:0%
would be I think a step in the right
direction

01:58:34.209 --> 01:58:34.219 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:58:37.010 --> 01:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you Mr
 
01:58:40.250 --> 01:58:40.260 align:start position:0%
chairman while I understand and agree
 
01:58:43.129 --> 01:58:43.139 align:start position:0%
with some of the um
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity about the number of
 
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
meetings and um and those kinds of
 
01:58:51.609 --> 01:58:51.619 align:start position:0%
things and concerned about taking the
 
01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
Contracting part out I think the intent
 
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
of the people who brought this
 
01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:58.990 align:start position:0%
of the people who brought this
legislation

01:58:58.990 --> 01:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:02.580 align:start position:0%
was to give the disabilities Community a
 
01:59:05.089 --> 01:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
bigger voice and I think
 
01:59:07.129 --> 01:59:07.139 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly there were only
 
01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
two people here sitting at the table so
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
they don't represent everybody in the
 
01:59:13.129 --> 01:59:13.139 align:start position:0%
disabilities Community but they came and
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
they um used their voice to say we don't
 
01:59:19.250 --> 01:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
want to lose this so I would tend to go
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
along with
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
um their requests that we concur on this
 
01:59:25.970 --> 01:59:25.980 align:start position:0%
so that would be my vote thank you
 
01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
I concur
 
01:59:33.890 --> 01:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
um with representative Weber
 
01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's better probably to have
 
01:59:38.810 --> 01:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
a partial of the no loaf this does start
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
the process of communication between the
 
01:59:43.070 --> 01:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
two entities
 
01:59:45.169 --> 01:59:45.179 align:start position:0%
and given the fact that retained Bill
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
608 is probably not going to work its
 
01:59:49.310 --> 01:59:49.320 align:start position:0%
way through the calendar until sometime
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
in March of next year we'll have time to
 
01:59:54.770 --> 01:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
see how this actually works if we're
 
01:59:56.810 --> 01:59:56.820 align:start position:0%
sensing or hearing that the
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
communication process which is this is
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
designed to do is in fact not working
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
the way we think it should work we can
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
always address it try to look at it from
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 608 and try to refine it at
 
02:00:10.850 --> 02:00:10.860 align:start position:0%
that point in time or
 
02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
so that my take on would be to concur
 
02:00:15.530 --> 02:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
take what we have get the process
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
started see how it works it was off time
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
if we need to to react to it thank you
 
02:00:23.570 --> 02:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative McKay
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I agree at this
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
point uh to concur
 
02:00:33.970 --> 02:00:33.980 align:start position:0%
I do with some interpretation
 
02:00:39.129 --> 02:00:39.139 align:start position:0%
based on years of difficulty
 
02:00:39.139 --> 02:00:40.810 align:start position:0%
based on years of difficulty
I'm

02:00:40.810 --> 02:00:40.820 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:00:44.689 --> 02:00:44.699 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with perceiving since
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
at least I put a document in that will
 
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
work if it doesn't
 
02:00:53.709 --> 02:00:53.719 align:start position:0%
if we don't get the results that we see
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that I've withdrew it it
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it's withdrawn from
 
02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:00.890 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it's withdrawn from
potential

02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
use that the chairman and I have talked
 
02:01:06.649 --> 02:01:06.659 align:start position:0%
about this I did not accept your
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawal yeah
 
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
yeah so that I agree with that with the
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that if we continue to
 
02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
have difficulties of communication that
 
02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:23.219 align:start position:0%
there is a opportunity to resolve that
 
02:01:26.510 --> 02:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
now right now
 
02:01:29.089 --> 02:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Plaza
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
I agree with concerns around Contracting
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
but I think we want this bill Senate
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
wants this bill I don't see a risk and
 
02:01:38.159 --> 02:01:40.149 align:start position:0%
wants this bill I don't see a risk and
negotiation

02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
negotiation
 
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
negotiating especially that we are
 
02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:43.570 align:start position:0%
negotiating especially that we are
already

02:01:43.570 --> 02:01:43.580 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:01:47.770 --> 02:01:47.780 align:start position:0%
for some reasonable Senate amendments so
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
I want to stick with our previous
 
02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
decision for committee of confidence
 
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you rectum Murphy
 
02:01:59.330 --> 02:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I am
 
02:02:01.010 --> 02:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
I I would
 
02:02:01.020 --> 02:02:01.790 align:start position:0%
I I would
um

02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:04.129 --> 02:02:04.139 align:start position:0%
agree with the concerns of in the
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
trepidation is that representative McKay
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
and Leon have about you know the timing
 
02:02:11.750 --> 02:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the structure Etc but on the other
 
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
hand when I have the people that are
 
02:02:16.609 --> 02:02:16.619 align:start position:0%
most directly impacted by the
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
legislation accepting three quarters of
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
a loaf understanding that we have
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place whether it be 608 or
 
02:02:25.729 --> 02:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
representative McKay's you know ability
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
to communicate with the oversight
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
committee I I I hate to in in regards to
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
representative web is concerned about
 
02:02:35.209 --> 02:02:35.219 align:start position:0%
getting to Committee of conference and
 
02:02:37.729 --> 02:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
having somehow just be sabotaged beyond
 
02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
the intent of this committee I would
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
frankly go along with concurrence and
 
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate safeguards in place
 
02:02:47.209 --> 02:02:47.219 align:start position:0%
feel very comfortable in doing that
 
02:02:49.070 --> 02:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
without going to Committee of conference
 
02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:55.189 --> 02:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.530 --> 02:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh yes I think we've heard from the very
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
people affected by this that they would
 
02:03:02.089 --> 02:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
be happy if we concur
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
um I think we should not this is one of
 
02:03:05.209 --> 02:03:05.219 align:start position:0%
those cases where we should not let the
 
02:03:07.609 --> 02:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
perfect be the enemy of the good
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
um so I think a simple concurs in order
 
02:03:12.589 --> 02:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
thank you other thoughts representative
 
02:03:12.599 --> 02:03:13.550 align:start position:0%

Leon

02:03:13.550 --> 02:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
Leon
 
02:03:15.169 --> 02:03:15.179 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman it seems that
 
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming Viewpoint is to do this
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
um I guess the one asked I would have
 
02:03:21.109 --> 02:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
would be that perhaps I can speak to
 
02:03:23.209 --> 02:03:23.219 align:start position:0%
those um on the other side see if they
 
02:03:24.649 --> 02:03:24.659 align:start position:0%
would agree about the idea of the
 
02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
request for a written response if there
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
is a full support of that last little
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
closing the Gap fantastic if not I'm
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
good with concurring so I don't know if
 
02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh if I could have a little bit of time
 
02:03:37.729 --> 02:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
just to see if they'd agree to request
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
that written response or if that would
 
02:03:44.089 --> 02:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:48.189 --> 02:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:51.410 --> 02:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to co-sponsor a bill to that
 
02:03:55.850 --> 02:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:58.729 --> 02:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that support um my biggest
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
concern is just how many changes are
 
02:04:03.290 --> 02:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
going on so um I I guess I'll stay stay
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
quiet for now we'll work towards that
 
02:04:08.689 --> 02:04:08.699 align:start position:0%
bill next year and um
 
02:04:12.770 --> 02:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:14.689 --> 02:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
okay any other thoughts any other
 
02:04:14.699 --> 02:04:17.990 align:start position:0%
okay any other thoughts any other
discussion

02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
02:04:23.089 --> 02:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
well I mean again but I'm here primarily
 
02:04:24.770 --> 02:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
hearing too is to Concur and forget
 
02:04:27.290 --> 02:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
about the committee of conference uh
 
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
representative Leon if you get new
 
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
information I'm certainly happy to
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
consider it but that would be the
 
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
recommendation it seems like we're
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
headed in right now so and again the
 
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
house will not be meeting until June 8th
 
02:04:41.270 --> 02:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
so we do have some time to find out
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay I know of no other business to come
 
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
before us this morning or today it's
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon now
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
