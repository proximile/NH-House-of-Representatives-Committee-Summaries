the Prime sponsor of this
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning Senator Pearl

to my old committee very much enjoy it
 
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
always look forward you'll see me I
 
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
think three times today before we're
 
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
done so I'll try not to be too boring or
 
00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.029 align:start position:0%
done so I'll try not to be too boring or
repetitive

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
repetitive
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
away uh for the record my name is
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Howard Pearl I am here to
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
introduce uh Senate Bill 329 which is
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
relative to the background checks of
 
00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 align:start position:0%
certain persons associated with Solid
 
00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.629 align:start position:0%
certain persons associated with Solid
Waste

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
Waste
 
00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 align:start position:0%
Management I brought this bill forward
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
on the request of the uh uh Dees they
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
had some technical changes that to a
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
bill that we passed last year relating
 
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
to background checks and they were uh
 
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
were able to identify some little bit of
 
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
cleanup that needed to happen and uh so
 
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill essentially does
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
I'm actually going to let um let uh the
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
director explain
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
really the technical aspects of it
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
because he will do a better job than I
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
will but um that's primarily all it does
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's a nice easy bill and I hope you
 
00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
it okay then any questions for Senator
 
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
Pearl I heard a good line this morning
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
on a bill that was introduced one of
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
your house members came over and said
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
he'd do his best to sidestep any
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
questions that were brought forward so I
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
thought that was a great line I am
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
okay well consider it sidestepped I
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
guess uh representative Bixby so so I
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
remember passing this last year yes and
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
it seemed like it was pretty simple and
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
obvious um so why are we seeing it again
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
well this is just some technical fixes
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
that the department identified that they
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
needed after we passed some cleanup
 
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
language again I I'll let director whims
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
speak more in detail to that okay thanks
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
you bet okay well thank you for coming
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
to introduce this bill and I believe the
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
next one is yours as well it is so I'll
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
hang around thank you great to see you
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
you and so now we have SB
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
329 okay this for the next bill we have
 
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh director whimet from nhdes Good
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
Morning um director
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
whimet and if I may take this time
 
00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
please we offer our condolences for the
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
loss of your
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
father thank you wel appreciate that
 
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.469 align:start position:0%
father thank you wel appreciate that
very

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
much so
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
um again for the record my name is Mike
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
whimet I serve as director of the waste
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
management division for New Hampshire
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
Dees um and as Senator Pearl indicated
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
um this is really a technical fix
 
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
because we very candidly we made a
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
mistake last year um we uh essentially
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
the this bill is purposed to correct a
 
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
drafting error that occurred in Senate
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 11 in the last session and um
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
that error was in RSA 149 M Solid Waste
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
Management act um so Senate Bill 211 was
 
00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:42.039 align:start position:0%
brought forth last year and representa B
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
is absolutely right it was pretty
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward um and it really was its
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
purpose was to adjust language in both
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
our hazardous waste management Act and
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management act relative
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
to conducting um criminal background
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
investigations for applicants or for
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
permits or for permit transfers for both
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste facilities and solid
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
waste facilities so there were
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
essentially four areas of the law that
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
needed to be amended and we got it right
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
for three of them but we didn't get it
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
right in one of them and the reason that
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
that happened the original bill was
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
correct but we we' made some amendments
 
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
to the bill on other matters that were
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate and not particularly
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
controversial but in so doing a drafting
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
error occurred um that candidly I just
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
didn't pick up when we proofed what came
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
from OSS so as a result we didn't
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
realize till after the bill was passed
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
that while we got the language right for
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
haard Waste permits and permit transfers
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
and solid waste permit transfers we did
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
not get the language right for solid
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
waste permit applications and
 
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
essentially what what the law requires
 
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
is that um the the agency request of
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
performance history um be submitted and
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
and and and applications for criminal
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
background checks from uh directors and
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
officers of the company as well as well
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
as folks who um are you know like
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
facility managers that would exercise
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
significant control over facility
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
operations and when the bill came back
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
um and finally the final version of the
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
bill that got approved reversed some of
 
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
that language in a way that meant that
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
as it reads now we could only conduct a
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
background investigation on directors
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
and officers and not those additional
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
parties and of course that's very
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
important because for any either solid
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
or Hazard space facility you want to
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
make sure the people who really have
 
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
control over what's happening there are
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%
are upstanding citizens that don't have
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
a criminal background um so in essence
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do is to correct
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
that language so that all four sections
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
of the statutes read identically and
 
00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
that we can properly conduct criminal
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
background investigations on um
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
applicants for solid waste facilities
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any
 
00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:56.839 align:start position:0%
questions so there were four places in
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
the law where this had to be changed and
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
we only
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
really well we we messed up one part
 
00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:06.839 align:start position:0%
exactly okay yeah representative Bixby
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
so if I read correctly the the bill and
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
how it was changing things basically the
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
language that was supposed to be on
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
something like line six got put on line
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
three instead and it's just moving the
 
00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
language to the right place in the
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph well stated yes okay um I
 
00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:25.959 align:start position:0%
would you have any objection if we were
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
to uh exec this today none whatsoever
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay thanks okay representative ger
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you director
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I I guess I'm
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
a little confused looking at at the
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
language it's perhaps I'm getting this
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
wrong so please correct me if I am that
 
00:10:43.949 --> 00:10:43.959 align:start position:0%
it it it looks like effectively it's
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
changing the the um background check
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
from a sha to a May by striking
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
the long dependent clause which begins
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of line five and placing it
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
in the passage which begins at line
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
nine it's changing it from the
 
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
application information shall
 
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.550 align:start position:0%
application information shall
include

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
to upon the request of the department so
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a shall that becomes a May at
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
department well no is that not correct
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
it it is not quite correct so um there
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
essentially two things going on there
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
whenever requested by the department
 
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry D no not at all uh in
 
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160 align:start position:0%
line four the sentence that starts on
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
line four it's essentially saying that
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
the applicant needs to include a
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
performance history of the applicant and
 
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
its officers and directors um relative
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
to the overall operations um Financial
 
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
Security and ownership of all the
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
facilities that they own so that's a
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
separate and a part that's what has to
 
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
be included in the application when you
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
go down to line nine it's and this the
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
the whenever requested by the department
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
is language that's been in the statute
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
for decad that that's not being changed
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
in any way it's always been
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
the written such that theoretically the
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
department could elect not to request
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
that background investigation in
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
practice that's not what we do when we
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
get an application for a standard solid
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
waste facility permit we do correct we
 
00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
do request that that application but
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
that discretion if you will is not in
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
play wasn't in play in Senate Bill 211
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't in play in this bill
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
that's always been written that way what
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
this is doing is ensuring that when we
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
do request background investigation we
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
can lawfully do so not just for officers
 
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
and directors but also for partners
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
individuals or entities having
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
managerial supervisor supervisory or
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
substantial decision-making Authority
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
and responsibility for management and
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
operations of the facility so without
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
that as as it currently reads and as it
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
was incorrectly amended um last year we
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
could only ask for such an investigation
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
on officers and directors which is not
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
adequate in our in our view and it's not
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
consistent with the way the statute has
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
has read for many years okay thank you
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
very much that I I just was a little
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
confused but you cleared it up for me so
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that representative nap I'm
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
sorry okay representative Murray thank
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um thanks for taking my
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
question I did want to just clarify if
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
we are considering potentially executing
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
it today um that there is no fiscal
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
impact because it it appears
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
that nothing would change it's either
 
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
the fiscal node has fallen off or
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that has changed that
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
would impact that process right I I I I
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
I mean I suppose you know I mean the
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact uh is really the the the
 
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
the applicant is required to pay a fee
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire State Police conducts
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
these background investigations and the
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
applicants required to pay a fee
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
associated with that that that New
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police administer it's
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
not administered under this statute um
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
and then but basically the the whole
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
reason the bill came about last year was
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
that it was brought to our attention
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
that the language that had long been in
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
our statute really didn't comport with
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
what the U the federal FBI the Federal
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Investigations wants to see
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
when they're going to make access to
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
their National Crime database so this is
 
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
really just making sure that our state
 
00:14:24.189 --> 00:14:24.199 align:start position:0%
language meets the very specific
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
requirements that they have so that we
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
can lawfully and appropriately request
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
these National back background
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
investigations representative
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um so just
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
further clarification so it sounds like
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
the first part talks about who's in the
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
application and the second part is is
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
sort of at the will of the of the
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
department is that correct um I I think
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's a fair a fair statement
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
sure okay representative H Haskins thank
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
my question at what time in the process
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
would you say these background checks
 
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
are instigated sure great question once
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
we are confident that we have a complete
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
application so that's it's an
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
application that we are in a position to
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
review and act on we would request that
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
it it typically those that information
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
and and for privacy purposes the
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
information is actually submitted
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
directly to the Department of Justice
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
not to the agency so we're not managing
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
you know the they fill out a very
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
specific and somewhat probing form about
 
00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:30.279 align:start position:0%
their finances and their history and
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
such we don't receive that that goes
 
00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:34.519 align:start position:0%
directly to the Department of Justice we
 
00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
just simply send a memo and say please
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
conduct an appropriate background per
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
performance history and background
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
investigation on the following parties
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
and then the Department of Justice
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
conducts that investigation thank you
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
would I followup yes thank you madam
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
chair would you say that this change and
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps the previous Bill makes the
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
process more protective for the state as
 
00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
we review these very important
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
applications and permits it does in the
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
sense that if we didn't make the change
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
there was going to be discomfort on the
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
part of the Department of Justice that
 
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
they could conduct these background
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
investigations so we wouldn't be able to
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
conduct them and then and and I think it
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
does provide a level of protection I
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
will say that in my tenure as director
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
we have denied one Hazardous Waste
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
Facility permit application because one
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
of the applicants for that permit had a
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
criminal background um that we thought
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
um made them ineligible and disqualified
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
them for from operating fa very much
 
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
chair and just to clarify so when these
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
application uh background checks go to
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
the doj if there is an issue the doj

we'll be introducing this bill to our
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
committee good morning again good
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
morning again chairwoman Aaron and
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
I am Senator Howard Pearl representing
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
District 17 and I live in the Great town
 
00:31:45.149 --> 00:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
of Lowden I am here today to introduce
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
587 and this is a pretty simple bill
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
that came as a request from the rescue
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
community and we worked in collaboration
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
with the the uh dog owners groups in New
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well as with commissioner
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
Jasper and uh Dr Crawford from the
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
Department of a to come up with the
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
language that you have in front of you
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
which simply allows for uh the CH slight
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
change to the quarantine rules that when
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
animals are traveling into the state
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
they have as you all know they have to
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh go through a mandatory quarantine
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
when they come in from other states and
 
00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
this would just simply allow animals
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
that had traveled together you know
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
could be a litter of puppies or or you
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
know liter of any animal there that's
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
subject to the quarantine that when they
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
come in um they've been travel
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
companions along the road the whole way
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
and currently they would technically
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
have to be separated when they came here
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
to uh to meet the quarantine
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
requirements and this would just simply
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
allow them to uh stay together for that
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
quarantine period while they were here
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
and and the uh the Commissioner's Office
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
Department of bag was fine with that it
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
gives them the authority to allow it it
 
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it has to happen but it
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
allows them to do it so in a nutshell
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill does another
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
another simple change and hopefully
 
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see your way to pass this one as
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you Senator um Pearl uh
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%

around that or is that just I'm sorry
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
say it once more the question about or
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%

00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
enclosures so I may have a different
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
version of that oh there we go sorry I
 
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
have two different versions okay uh we
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
made a slight change um I'm trying to
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
remember there was a reason we put that
 
00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
in and I apologize Heather do you
 
00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
remember why we put that in the age
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
restriction oh that's what it was that's
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
right we we uh we just wanted it to make
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
sure that the animals weren't too young
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
that that were coming in so we had some
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
guard reils on it to kind of limit
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
it represent Murray thank you madam
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
tragus uh sort of following up on that
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
question with regard to the age
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions have we delineated what's
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
too young and then like where the limit
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
is somewhere else in statute there is
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
another section especially with
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
um there gosh I'm trying to remember
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is uh there is another area that
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
does that I'll make sure I get a clearer
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
definition for the committee on that if
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
you want one because I I don't remember
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
the exact specifics to it so I have a
 
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
question as to um this is just in
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
reference to litter
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
mates right this what about animals that
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
come together just in a group yeah this
 
00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
just kept it to littermates L thinking
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
more of you know litter of puppies or a
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
litter of kittens or something that had
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
come in that they could stay together as
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
they had traveled you know they grown up
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
and travel together so if you had just
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
like three or four dogs that were
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
traveling in a trailer together those
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
animals would have to be quarantined
 
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
separately yes I believe so
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby you had a question
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
was I was just going to uh double check
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
but I I'm fairly sure that under the
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
transfer Pro uh requirements for animals
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
that um that there is a that there are
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
um age restrictions on that I I believe
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
you're correct too and that's why I said
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
I'll have to look at it I just can't
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
remember off the top of my head where
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
it's located in
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
statute representative NAB this is sort
 
00:35:44.829 --> 00:35:44.839 align:start position:0%
of a comment question but we we got that
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
email from dogs dogs the organization
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and they referenced the need for
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
proper age restri restricted limitations
 
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
and size of um enclosures so I just want
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
to make you know and they had some
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
thought thoughts on what those should be
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that lives
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere um yeah they were actually
 
00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
involved in working with us and helping
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
us craft this language along with the
 
00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
rescues to make sure that we get
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
something everyone could be good with so
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
we think it just lives somewhere else in
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
statute and it's not part of this okay
 
00:36:15.069 --> 00:36:15.079 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative ktoa
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you

Senator
 
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
um in working on this bill
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
previously I believe that we delved into
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
age um uh at that time and really put
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
into statute um what age animals could
 
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:38.200 align:start position:0%
be restricted uh do you recall that I do
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
and I I just don't remember the
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
specifics apologies for that that was a
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago at least it was but
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify that we already
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
have in statute age restrictions I'm
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
quite certain we do thank
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
um we are very grateful to Senator Pearl
 
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:16.720 align:start position:0%
for bringing this bill forward um we've
 
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
had many conversations with the state
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
vet and the commissioner about the
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
ability to quarantine litter mates
 
00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
together um and what this bill would
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
allow for is the entially granting the
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner rulem authority to address
 
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
this issue in rules um with regards to
 
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
some questions that were posed earlier
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 437 currently um States very clearly
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
that um animals cannot be younger than 8
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
weeks of age prior to transfer into the
 
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:49.640 align:start position:0%
state so those age restrictions do live
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
in statute um and there are many other
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
requirements existing in statute and in
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
rules um related to the trans transer of
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
animals so this would simply give the
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner Ru making authority to
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
address address this quarantine issue in
 
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
rules um so I'd be happy to take any
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
other questions about this issue
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
okay um representative Duty and before
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
you uh ask your question I just want to
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
confirm that in currently in RSA 437
 
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.670 align:start position:0%
confirm that in currently in RSA 437
colon

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
colon
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
8 section
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
three number three Roman numeral three
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
it states no person firm Corporation or
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
other entity shall ship or bring into
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to offer for
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
transfer in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
any cat dog or ferret less than eight
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
weeks of age no person firm Corporation
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
or other entity shall offer for transfer
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
any cat dog or feret less than eight
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
weeks of age so uh representative Bixby
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
that's where it lives and statute so
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
proceed representative dsy sorry no uh
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
no problem thank you madam chair um just
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
um a little bit off base with this but
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
how does how does this get enforced I
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
mean we often times hear stories of um
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
trucks coming up with loaded with dogs
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
and you know parking at a rest area and
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
selling them or something like that so
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
how does this how does this actually get
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
enforced and is it only um and how does
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
it affect people who go to another state
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
and purchase a dog and then and then
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
bring it
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
back so the the state veterinarian only
 
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
has oversight of things that happen in
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and primarily over his
 
00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079 align:start position:0%
lienes so the our organization is made
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
primarily up of licensed facilities so
 
00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
we are all licensed by the state
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
veterinarian um we are subject to
 
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
inspection um I think by Min I think
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
instead statute the minimum is once a
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
year most of us go through an an
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
inspection twice a year and then by
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
complaint so if the state veterinarian
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
um has concerns that are submitted by
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
the public he'll inspect a license
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
facility to follow up on those
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
complaints um so that's primarily how
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
these things are investigated and
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
enforced is when the public um feels
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
that something has has happened that
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't have uh they get reported
 
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
to the state bet and he investigates
 
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:29.829 align:start position:0%
to the state bet and he investigates
you're

00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Murray thank you
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:38.680 align:start position:0%
um so so with with Clarity I think we
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
have sort of um addressed the issue with
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
regard to um age restriction and as long
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
as uh those are those rsas are cited in
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
lines 4 through n somewhere I think that
 
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
that addresses the issue pursuant to
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to age restriction and then
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
it seems that there's probably a
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
separate RSA somewhere where regarding
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
size enclosure somewhere else um that's
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
actually listed in rules so in addition
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
to RSA 437 we abide by all of the rules
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
in a 1700 okay um so oftentimes the
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner will use rules to sort of
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
delve into the more specific um
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
requirements related to Animal Health
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
um so there's all the RSA stuff and then
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
all the rule stuff that we have to
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
comply with perfect thank you you're
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
welcome representative K thank you um
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
did you say that was EG rule 1700 I
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
believe so yes thank
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
you anybody else I represent Bixby uh
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
just as a a matter of information uh the
 
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
section um four um 437 colon 9 is a list
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
of of things that are uh um provided for
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
rul making so it gives a a rough outline
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
in statute and then says that the
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
department will cover those in
 
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
rules yep
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
committee NOP seeing none thank you very
 
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
much for you coming and testifying this
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
morning anyone else wish to speak on um
 
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.870 align:start position:0%
morning anyone else wish to speak on um
SB

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
587 see no one um may I have the blue
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:39.549 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
favor and I'm going to close out the
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
587 and I would pose the question uh is
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
the committee interested Ed in executing
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
this bill at this time that would make
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
sense okay um would I hear a motion from
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
someone um representative
 
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
NAB I would motion um ought to pass on
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
587 representative kraton seconds and
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative NAB would you like to
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion um I think this is
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
a good bill that was supported by
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
different Societies in the rescue
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
community so um I think it makes sense
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
to move forward with it okay great I
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
would then direct the uh clerk to call
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
the role please thank you madam chair

reason for it not to thank you that uh
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
bill will be on consent though and I
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
just want to add um for the record on
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
the online um portal said that there
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
were 11 people in favor of this bill and
 
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.630 align:start position:0%
were 11 people in favor of this bill and
zero

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
opposed so I'm going to close out the uh
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
you well and that was 11 people online

you well and that was 11 people online
yeah

00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
and if I didn't close out the hearing
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
hearing all right um before we uh I know
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're we're running really early and
 
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
we've been very efficient and um I thank
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
everybody for that I do want to bring to
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
your attention um I passed out a letter
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
that was um
 
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
composed from our committee to our
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
federal delegation with regard to House
 
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.549 align:start position:0%
federal delegation with regard to House
Bill

00:46:30.549 --> 00:46:30.559 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
1572 which was uh prohibiting using mRNA
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
technology and food and requiring the
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
label the labeling of lab grown meat and
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
food containing
 
00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
insects um this was a letter that was
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
written um collaboration with um
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby and uh I believe
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
myself and others and I want to thank
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
everybody for the work on that uh if you
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
haven't read through the letter I I will
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
just read it briefly um to our Senators
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
um and to our house Representatives I'm
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
writing to you on behalf of the State of
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire House of Representatives
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
committee on environment and agriculture
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
the committee recently reviewed House
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 1572 entitled prohibiting using
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
mRNA technology and food and requiring
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
the labeling of lab grown meat and food
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
containing insects as the title implies
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
this bill addresses the concerns New
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens have regarding it
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
what is put in their food and whether
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
additives and ingredients are fully and
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
accurately disclosed while well
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
documented testimony indicated that mRNA
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
vaccination technology does not impact
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
our food supply articles in the journal
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
molecular biotechnology published by
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
Nature discuss a long-running effort to
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
genetically modify food as a vehicle for
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines and other
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals it is the opinion of the
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
committee that food that is used as a
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
drug delivery device needs to be
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
thoroughly labeled and care carefully
 
00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720 align:start position:0%
controlled a second topic of the bill is
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
meat grown from cell culture it is the
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
opinion of the committee that any food
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
product derived from laboratory
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
culturing of animal cells needs to be
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
clearly labeled in such a way that it
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
will not be confused with meat from a
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
conventionally raised slaughtered and
 
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.270 align:start position:0%
conventionally raised slaughtered and
processed

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
processed
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
animal the bill also raises a concern
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
about food derived from insects we heard
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
testimony that the only insect currently
 
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA for use in food is
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
the Cricut and that currently current
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
labeling policies do require clear
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
labeling of insects beyond the
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
inadvertent contamination threshold is
 
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
the opinion of the committee that any
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
use of insects and food should be
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
clearly labeled to make sure the
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
consumer is aware of what they are
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
eating because all of the all three of
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
these issues are under the jurisdiction
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
of federal law the committee felt that
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
state level legislation was
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
inappropriate we urge you to make sure
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
that these issues are thoroughly
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
addressed by federal law thank you for
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
your attention to this matter
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to know if this um uh if
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
the committee approves with this letter
 
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
I shall then sign it and send it off to
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation representative
 
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
dsy uh yeah just uh my copy just for
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
readability um on the very last
 
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph um towards the end of the
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
second sentence um there's an additional
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
a a typo labeled in such a way mine says
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
labeled in a such a way is that what
 
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:34.799 align:start position:0%
yours so that first a needs to be
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
deleted yes ah yes okay and and I would
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
just um this is minor but the the next
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
sentence here the bill also raises I
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
would make that a new paragraph because
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the insects at that
 
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
point not the cultured meat so I would
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
just make that a a new paragraph that's
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative com thank you madam
 
00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.430 align:start position:0%
okay representative com thank you madam
chair

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
um so I think the letter is Well written
 
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
I do have some concerns because it says
 
00:50:25.230 --> 00:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
while well documented testimony
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
indicated that Mr vaccination does not
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
impact our food
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
supply um more recently it has come to
 
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
light that mRNA technology is actually
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
being used in our pork um more
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
specifically in the
 
00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines um of the animals um and the
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
other thing is is and I agree with you
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
that the FDA uh has only approved Cricut
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
in our food but we have there's been
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
more and more articles talking about uh
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
worms and things like that but we
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
haven't discussed that
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to bring that to light
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
um so okay thank
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
you so I I will um I will ask our uh
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee researcher who helped draft
 
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
this to make those two um typo changes
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll sign the letter and then
 
00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
we'll send it
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
out oh I'm sorry I didn't see you
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you apologies no
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
no no that's okay okay I also just
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure we haven't really
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
addressed any of the the bioengineered
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
food disclosure standards that already
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
exist and I wondered if that was
 
00:51:38.349 --> 00:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
something that needed to be listed in
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
here because those were drafted June
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
23rd or excuse me December 29th 2023
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
mandatory compliance beginning June 23rd
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
2025 so I
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
just it it speaks to some of that in in
 
00:51:57.870 --> 00:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
that section so I was just curious
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
represent viby yeah I I think that the
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
um the the way that the letter is uh
 
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
phrased especially at the end
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
um the the committee felt that the
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
legisl uh we uh we urge you to make sure
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
that these issues are thoroughly
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
addressed by federal law so in fact so
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
if if there is a federal law that exists
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
that covers these then um then great
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
if there is a motion if there's a move
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
to change that federal law then it would
 
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:33.799 align:start position:0%
be our opinion the opinion of the
 
00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
committee that we wouldn't want to have
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
a law that changed it in a way that
 
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
would uh diminish this protection and if
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
there are some aspects of it that are
 
00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
not yet covered then we would want those
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
to be covered so it's not it's it's just
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
really um making them uh aware that we
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
think that these things should be
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately labeled and if the
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
labeling is already in place then great
 
00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
if not it should happen uh if there's
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
any move to remove labeling that should
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.349 align:start position:0%
 
Happ

00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
Happ
 
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right then um thank you for
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
your review of this and we will be back
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
here at one o'clock we' finished early
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
and we've got some time represent fenza
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
you have uh something for the
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
committee yeah I just I'm going to agree
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
with um representative ktoa on that line
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
because just recently in the last I'd
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
say two to three weeks there has been a
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
ton of information that's come out in
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
the news in regards that certain states
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
are Banning this um spe specifically
 
00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
mRNA in their meet um so I just I don't
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
like the well documented you know cuz
 
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
then then it basically you know I think
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're I don't know I think that pigeon
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
holds us to something you know I don't
 
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
like that line
 
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:06.510 align:start position:0%
like that line
so

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
else I'm pretty good at that so I I
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
would be happy to work on I could
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
literally do that right here before we
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
happy this is a good
 
00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:41.510 align:start position:0%
happy this is a good
compromise

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
positions Madam chair yes I would I
 
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
would just say that what this says is um
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
well documented I believe is an
 
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
adjective for
 
00:54:55.950 --> 00:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
testimony and so that is a true I mean
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
that is a true statement that we had
 
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
well documented testimony so that has
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with what's in the news
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
now and I will further say that I think
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
I consume a lot of news read about three
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
papers a day and I haven't seen anything
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
in any of the
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
newspapers um including the union leader
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
um that has been talking about this so I
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
think when you talk about it's in the
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
news it depends on what news you're
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
consuming so I would be a little
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
statement all right represent ger thank
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and to representative
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
Duty's points I and and to reiterate a
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
point I just made I I think this
 
00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
language is well drafted and I think
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's a good compromise I think it's we
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
all agree on the importance of labeling
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
although we may have some disagreements
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
on some of the uh the specifics in
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
detail so I think the language does a
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
night's job of pulling the the the
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee's consensus together I also
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
agree with repres representative Duty's
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
point about this refers specifically to
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
the testimony which is what we did here
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and that you know short of reopening
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
this whole thing and getting a lot more
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't think we're going to
 
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
come to a consensus and we may never on
 
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
some of the specifics but I think this
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
language does a nice job of bringing us
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
to a point we should all be able to
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
agree on okay representative Crayton
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
yeah Madam chair I I mean there's always
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
room for improvement and uh if represent
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
pretends it offers better language I
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
think we should look at that and so
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
maybe after our committee meeting this
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon we take a look at the update a
 
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:36.039 align:start position:0%
language and see if that works if it's
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
not so be it if it does then so be it
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't have a problem
 
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
looking at something improve
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative comor thank you madam
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
chair um I didn't mean to open up a can
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
of worms I'm not saying that it it's
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
long as we're not eating them that's
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
fine yes well don't hold your breath um
 
00:56:59.470 --> 00:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
because you may be sooner than you think
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
but I guess what I was trying to say um
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
is that and it's from the pork business
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
and it states that uh they are using the
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
MRNA vaccines in pork I'm not saying
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't say that it's being
 
00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:21.559 align:start position:0%
transferred to the food but they are
 
00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
using the MRNA vaccines in swine so I
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
think um I just want to make sure that's
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
clarified I'm not you know I'm not
 
00:57:34.029 --> 00:57:34.039 align:start position:0%
trying to dismiss what this says I'm
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
also but I'm also trying
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people understand that
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
just because we say it's indicated does
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
not impact our food supply that doesn't
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
mean that they're not being vaccinated
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
with the MRNA vaccine um because that is
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
well documented and that was also said
 
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.789 align:start position:0%
well documented and that was also said
in

00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
testimony okay representative Howard if
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
I remember correctly thank you madam
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
chair if I remember correctly when when
 
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
they talked about the MRNA being used in
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
vaccines and food they also mentioned
 
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:07.240 align:start position:0%
that it there was no sign at all that it
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
was passed on into the into the meat
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
meet represent Morris thank you madam
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
chair um may I recommend that if people
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
have additional concerns that dive in
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
deeper to some of these issues you send
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
a personal letter to your you know
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives but as far far as
 
00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
addressing a letter that represents the
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole it should be
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
language that we are all in agreement on
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
and if you want to dive into that deeper
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
then um more power to you to to dive
 
00:58:40.029 --> 00:58:40.039 align:start position:0%
into it and write letters and and you
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
know pursue that further but I think
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
that if we are addressing this letter
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
from the full committee um the language
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
needs to represent the feelings of the
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
full committee which is the labeling
 
00:58:53.069 --> 00:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
should be appropriate thank you
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
represent and thank you madam chair and
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
that the language should represent the
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
whole committee but it should also
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
represent the whole testimony that we
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
heard and the state uh that did say that
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
they are using mRNA vaccination
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
technology in animals that are being
 
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated that we're using for food but
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
it is not impacting our food supply so
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
transparent representative uh neb thank
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
you I mean I think this letter has a lot
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
more power coming from our committee and
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
I think if we Workshop it at this point
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
it's going to fall apart like to
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative drana's point this is a
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
compromise between different views on
 
00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:41.319 align:start position:0%
this situation and you know I I I think
 
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:43.039 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more powerful coming from the
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole so I would leave it
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
as it is I think we're really opening up
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
a can of
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
worms representative kot's Point um so
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
that's my point and you know I don't
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
really want to be on it if it starts to
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
feel like something that's really
 
00:59:59.029 --> 00:59:59.039 align:start position:0%
one-sided in its Viewpoint thank you
 
00:59:59.039 --> 01:00:01.630 align:start position:0%
one-sided in its Viewpoint thank you
representative

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
prenza yeah I I'm sorry I opened up a
 
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
can of worms I don't I I want it to come
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
from the committee I just I was here for
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
that testimony and there wasn't a lot so
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
this makes it sound like you know there
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
was such robust testimony and for the
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
folks that were here there wasn't a lot
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
of testimony um on this subject and and
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's why some of this information is
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
happening literally on the Fly and and
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
based upon this isn't something that I'm
 
01:00:33.309 --> 01:00:33.319 align:start position:0%
talking about in the union leader this
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
is in um some medical journals this uh
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
one's from specifically from the UK um
 
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
Epoch times um yeah so that's where I'm
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
getting some of my recent information as
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
well as I think it is is it Italy that
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
just banned this as well so that's why
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just um I'm just meaning lab grown
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
meat and stuff like that I'm fine with
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
the couple of grammatical changes I
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
resend my thing it's fine I want the
 
01:01:04.990 --> 01:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
committee to move forward with this and
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I just you know it's the well
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
documented it made it's made it sound
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
like we had people out the door and I
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
don't believe we did so um this wasn't
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
like the glue trap thing so um represent
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
Howard I think that um thank you madam
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
chair I think that uh the final sentence
 
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
in this is what we all agree on and that
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
is about the labeling I don't think we
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to give an advanced
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
course in this topic to the the people
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
that to whom we're addressing this
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
letter that I think we all agree 100%
 
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
that labeling is the most important
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
thing and the the sentences that come
 
01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:41.799 align:start position:0%
before that are support that very
 
01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
strongly um so I I you know I think that
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
we should focus more on what the point
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
is which is to the proper
 
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
labeling representative ger thank you
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I just wanted to say in
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
in uh kind of reference to
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative comtois point which I
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
hear and and respect I think that the
 
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
the sentence while well documented
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
testimony indicated that M mRNA
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination technology does not impact
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
our food supply I think that that I hear
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
what you're saying but even from what
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
you just read right there's a difference
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
between the MRNA vaccine technology for
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
the swine but at this point there isn't
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that that is being transmitted
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
through the food supply which is the
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
language that is in the
 
01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:28.839 align:start position:0%
right that is that is correct but it
 
01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't well documented that it we didn't
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
hear well documented testimony we only
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from basically the State
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
Vet do telling us that this is what he
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
is hearing and what he has seen that to
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
me that's not well
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
documented um so that is my concern so
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
um it because when I think of something
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
well documented I think that there's a
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
stack of papers are many articles
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
telling me that I can go back and look
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
at science and health journals to say
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
that this is true and we did not have
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
that here in in our committee so that is
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
factual representative preten how about
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
this real quick right let's just take
 
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
out well documented while testimony
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
included and we're all set if we're all
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
okay with
 
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
that that's one
 
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
removal because it
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't well representative Howard you
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
had something no no representative H
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair my problem
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
with changing it is that I'm not 100% on
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
board with it the way it is so I'm
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
trying to compromise with it but if we
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
start to pull back on that then I'm out
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
all right well the thing of it is is
 
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
that we want we we had made a promise
 
01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
actually to the uh to the sponsor of
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill that we would uh we would
 
01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
write a letter from the committee uh

take it
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
away well thank you again it's uh great
 
02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
to be back for a third time in the same
 
02:36:12.030 --> 02:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
day it's almost like I live living over
 
02:36:14.790 --> 02:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
here now uh for the record my name is
 
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Howard Pearl from Lowden and I
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
am here to introduce uh Senate bill 385
 
02:36:23.309 --> 02:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
relative to the cost of care fund this
 
02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
is a bill that uh the commissioner from
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture who I see
 
02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
is here and I'll hopefully he'll have
 
02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
some convincing comments for you on why
 
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
you should pass the bill but this was a
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh request that he had and uh to put in
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
for some language to clean up an issue
 
02:36:43.550 --> 02:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
that he was uh seeing from instituting
 
02:36:46.389 --> 02:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
the uh cost of care fund and for those
 
02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
of you who remember this was a bill we
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
put in uh
 
02:36:53.230 --> 02:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
I think it was 2017 or 2018 we put into
 
02:36:56.389 --> 02:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
effect to help communities deal with the
 
02:36:58.469 --> 02:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
cost of confiscations and things that
 
02:37:00.750 --> 02:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
occur with uh those expenses around
 
02:37:02.750 --> 02:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty cases
 
02:37:05.710 --> 02:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
so what this bill will do is uh simply
 
02:37:08.389 --> 02:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
allow the uh that fund to pay directly
 
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
to the third party which often is a a
 
02:37:13.269 --> 02:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
rescue and it will allow those funds to
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
go directly through and not pass through
 
02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
the uh the budget of the town which is
 
02:37:19.309 --> 02:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
causing some issues with the money
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
coming coming in and the way they're
 
02:37:22.389 --> 02:37:22.399 align:start position:0%
accounting so I know the commission will
 
02:37:24.510 --> 02:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
have further comments on the details of
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
that so I'll wrap it up right there and
 
02:37:28.990 --> 02:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
leave it with you all right thank you so
 
02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:31.600 align:start position:0%

Pearl seeing none thank you awesome
 
02:37:35.950 --> 02:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and I believe that's my last
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%

in touch with senator inis for the next
 
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
one I tried he was in a leadership
 
02:37:52.389 --> 02:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
meeting and I have not been able to but
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%

02:37:58.870 --> 02:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
it okay I would like to call
 
02:38:06.349 --> 02:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
um Sean Jasper department of
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
welcome good Mo good afternoon Madam
 
02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee I am
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
Sean Jos commissioner of the Department
 
02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:21.429 align:start position:0%
Sean Jos commissioner of the Department
of

02:38:21.429 --> 02:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um you know this is this is
 
02:38:27.150 --> 02:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
one of those things where sort of kick
 
02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
myself being a guy who was a selectman
 
02:38:33.790 --> 02:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and I'm currently a member of the
 
02:38:36.429 --> 02:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
budget Committee in my town and I should
 
02:38:40.550 --> 02:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
have realized the problem with this and
 
02:38:42.630 --> 02:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the current language
 
02:38:44.429 --> 02:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
is probably much of an issue for larger
 
02:38:48.830 --> 02:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
towns but it is for smaller ones in that
 
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
when we
 
02:38:52.510 --> 02:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
when they ask us for
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that money goes back into
 
02:38:58.030 --> 02:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
the general fund and cannot replenish
 
02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
the fund from once it came so it just
 
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
gets into the fund balance so the
 
02:39:05.550 --> 02:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
problem is that it really doesn't
 
02:39:08.070 --> 02:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
directly help in the way that we
 
02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
expected it to because if they don't
 
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
have a line item equal to what could be
 
02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:14.870 align:start position:0%
have a line item equal to what could be
their

02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
expenses they've got to find money
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
someplace else and that was never our
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
intent our intent was to say okay you've
 
02:39:24.429 --> 02:39:24.439 align:start position:0%
got this problem and you're taking care
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
of animals and we want to help you with
 
02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
your budget and this does not do that so
 
02:39:32.790 --> 02:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment fixes that so that they
 
02:39:34.590 --> 02:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
certify that these Services were
 
02:39:37.309 --> 02:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
provided and this was the uh correct
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
amount and then it doesn't pass through
 
02:39:42.830 --> 02:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
the town budget doesn't cost cost them
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
cause them a problem the second change
 
02:39:47.309 --> 02:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
is I don't know who caught this it
 
02:39:51.309 --> 02:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't wasn't me but in in EV almost
 
02:39:53.309 --> 02:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
every statute that I've ever seen it
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
always speaks to the commissioner making
 
02:39:58.510 --> 02:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
these decisions and this says the
 
02:40:00.910 --> 02:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the state veterinarian
 
02:40:03.389 --> 02:40:03.399 align:start position:0%
which really is not the proper way to do
 
02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
it it should just be the commissioner so
 
02:40:08.349 --> 02:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
those are the changes and we think it
 
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
will uh make a big difference
 
02:40:12.510 --> 02:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
particularly in smaller towns allowing
 
02:40:16.150 --> 02:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
them to take care of uh of abused
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
animals all right any questions for the
 
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner representative
 
02:40:23.590 --> 02:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um who who
 
02:40:27.550 --> 02:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
who would be among the third party so
 
02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
often as the senator said um it would be
 
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
rescues it you know I anybody who
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
normally takes the the Humane Societies
 
02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
take in the animals we read about it all
 
02:40:43.150 --> 02:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
the time when these animals are seized
 
02:40:45.389 --> 02:40:45.399 align:start position:0%
and um they're they're taken in and
 
02:40:48.190 --> 02:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
cared for but the towns are are build
 
02:40:50.830 --> 02:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
and in many cases this is why the
 
02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
animals aren't seized at all because of
 
02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
the expense to the town hello sure
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
follow um would that include individuals
 
02:41:00.309 --> 02:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
outside of Societies or or
 
02:41:00.319 --> 02:41:01.830 align:start position:0%
outside of Societies or or
agency

02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:41:05.110 --> 02:41:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh it could potentially it could
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
potentially include those if a
 
02:41:10.269 --> 02:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
town uh found somebody who was willing
 
02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
to take them in and they decided they
 
02:41:16.830 --> 02:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
were the proper um proper people to care
 
02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
for them yes I believe I believe so
 
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
don't see any anything um in here it
 
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
says a third party and it doesn't State
 
02:41:26.469 --> 02:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
the type of third
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
party represent
 
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
vix yeah just a a little bit more
 
02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
background on this and just um to and
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
you can confirm that I've got this right
 
02:41:42.590 --> 02:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh the cost of care fund was
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
created uh in response to the uh Great
 
02:41:49.550 --> 02:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
Dane situation in wolfboro where there
 
02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
were 75 Great Danes that had to be
 
02:41:55.830 --> 02:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
seized because they were being kept in
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
very negligent conditions and that was a
 
02:42:02.990 --> 02:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
substantial cost to the town of wolfboro
 
02:42:05.830 --> 02:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
which figuring out how to deal with that
 
02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
cost was very complicated the it was uh
 
02:42:11.950 --> 02:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
determined that there were certain
 
02:42:14.510 --> 02:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
situations where town law enforcement
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
may be unwilling to deal with uh situ
 
02:42:23.070 --> 02:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
situations of animal negligence uh uh
 
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
abuse because of the P potential cost
 
02:42:28.510 --> 02:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
the idea the cost of the car fund would
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
to would be to take that excuse off the
 
02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
table so that we would definitely so
 
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement would definitely
 
02:42:39.870 --> 02:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
take care of the uh of investigating and
 
02:42:42.910 --> 02:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting uh animal uh negligence
 
02:42:47.550 --> 02:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
abuse and uh the cost of care fund would
 
02:42:51.309 --> 02:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
allow for the taking care of animals who
 
02:42:54.269 --> 02:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
were seized in that situation and then
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
the animals that would were seized the
 
02:42:59.950 --> 02:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would be in charge of
 
02:43:02.590 --> 02:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
figuring out who would take care of them
 
02:43:05.269 --> 02:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
but it it would usually be a third party
 
02:43:08.030 --> 02:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
it could be it typically it's a rescue
 
02:43:10.349 --> 02:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
organization or a shelter but it could
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
be uh individuals who uh also have some
 
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
connection with the animals uh as uh was
 
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
written in another piece of legislation
 
02:43:27.389 --> 02:43:27.399 align:start position:0%
so uh so basically the am I correct in
 
02:43:30.190 --> 02:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
thinking that you're just here with this
 
02:43:32.670 --> 02:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
amendment in or this bill in order to
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that that process can work
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
more effectively for those situations
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
that that's exactly true thank you
 
02:43:41.950 --> 02:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
representative and I would would point
 
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
out that still with the cost of care
 
02:43:45.870 --> 02:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
fund out
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
there what is to the best of my
 
02:43:51.309 --> 02:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
knowledge always attempting to be done
 
02:43:53.190 --> 02:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
is to work with the owners of the anal
 
02:43:56.429 --> 02:43:56.439 align:start position:0%
animals to have them surrender them and
 
02:43:59.870 --> 02:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
when they do that then there is no um
 
02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
there is no cost to this fund or to the
 
02:44:04.269 --> 02:44:04.279 align:start position:0%
towns that doesn't always happen but
 
02:44:08.110 --> 02:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
often um the police or the prosecutors
 
02:44:10.590 --> 02:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
will tell people if you do this you're
 
02:44:12.590 --> 02:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
not going to be charged with as many
 
02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
counts because they can be charged with
 
02:44:17.389 --> 02:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
a count of Cruelty against each animal
 
02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
that has been determined to be being
 
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
properly cared for and so that is a
 
02:44:25.150 --> 02:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
method that is is used effectively and
 
02:44:28.910 --> 02:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
it does reduce um often the cost to the
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
to the fund or the municipalities but um
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper may I ask um do you
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
know how much money is in that fund
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
currently you know I had that prepared
 
02:44:43.269 --> 02:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
for the Senate meeting Senate hearing on
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
that and um we just
 
02:44:49.389 --> 02:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
moved and I started started out
 
02:44:51.550 --> 02:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday morning without even having a
 
02:44:55.389 --> 02:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
computer and I cannot tell you that
 
02:45:00.750 --> 02:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
amount right now um I think we're in the
 
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
$500,000 range I will tell you that also
 
02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
because we've been packing up and moving
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
and because we've had the other programs
 
02:45:13.030 --> 02:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
I have a number of applications um on my
 
02:45:15.790 --> 02:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
desk that are probably totaling over
 
02:45:18.269 --> 02:45:18.279 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for reimbursement right now
 
02:45:21.230 --> 02:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's a ball par but um and how do how
 
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
does that fund get replenished it is a
 
02:45:26.190 --> 02:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
budget item right now and there is a cap
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
of $2 million on the fund um currently
 
02:45:31.830 --> 02:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
to build it up it has been budgeted at
 
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
300 300 to
 
02:45:38.590 --> 02:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
$350,000 a year um I believe so we'll
 
02:45:41.269 --> 02:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
have more money coming in in in July I
 
02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
do expect that I will be ratcheting that
 
02:45:47.710 --> 02:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
back based on the rate of SP of spend
 
02:45:50.030 --> 02:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
but did want to get it to a reasonable
 
02:45:52.110 --> 02:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
amount so that if there were another
 
02:45:54.349 --> 02:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
case like the great Dayne one that the
 
02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
fund would be adequately
 
02:46:00.510 --> 02:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
um um funded I'm hopeful that we will
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
continue to notch it up for a while but
 
02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
not at the rate we are at the moment do
 
02:46:08.110 --> 02:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not the
 
02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
um the trend of seizure is going up or
 
02:46:16.389 --> 02:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
down at all um I don't know because I
 
02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any history as to what towns
 
02:46:21.630 --> 02:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
were doing before for I know that what's
 
02:46:25.110 --> 02:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
going on right now in the current law um
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
has been somewhat of an impediment
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
because those small towns can't have
 
02:46:34.550 --> 02:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
their their fund re re
 
02:46:40.269 --> 02:46:40.279 align:start position:0%
uh refunded if you will so um but some
 
02:46:42.630 --> 02:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
of these are really really
 
02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:44.230 align:start position:0%
of these are really really
difficult

02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:46:48.429 --> 02:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
for um departments police departments or
 
02:46:50.190 --> 02:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
other agencies to move forward with
 
02:46:52.110 --> 02:46:52.120 align:start position:0%
seizures we've had a couple that have
 
02:46:55.150 --> 02:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
been been still very difficult and and
 
02:46:57.870 --> 02:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
time consuming to actually get to that
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
point where the animals are are seized
 
02:47:02.830 --> 02:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
and the most recent one which was pretty
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
horrific ultimately I think all but a
 
02:47:10.269 --> 02:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
couple animals were were um
 
02:47:12.830 --> 02:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
surrendered representative Murray thank
 
02:47:14.230 --> 02:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
02:47:17.389 --> 02:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
my question um so I had
 
02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
a I had a question question in reading
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
the current uh bill it does say that um
 
02:47:26.469 --> 02:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
there's the ability to respond to such
 
02:47:28.110 --> 02:47:28.120 align:start position:0%
applications within 15 days and
 
02:47:32.030 --> 02:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
distribute no more than $500,000 per
 
02:47:36.349 --> 02:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
application so my question was then um
 
02:47:40.830 --> 02:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
if if we're only at 300 or so thousand
 
02:47:43.269 --> 02:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
or or what have you is there any concern
 
02:47:45.429 --> 02:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
that uh one application alone could
 
02:47:47.710 --> 02:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
deplete the entire thing no we're over
 
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
500,000 in the fund right now and as of
 
02:47:53.950 --> 02:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
July 1st it will be another 3 or 350
 
02:47:56.230 --> 02:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
going into it so no I don't have any
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
concerns with that currently but yeah I
 
02:48:02.830 --> 02:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
think isn't it isn't it possible though
 
02:48:05.710 --> 02:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
as a a commissioner that you could go to
 
02:48:08.269 --> 02:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and request extra funds
 
02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
to be placed in this had if you had an
 
02:48:15.230 --> 02:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
emergency of some sort I I think that is
 
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
always an option yes okay representative
 
02:48:20.469 --> 02:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
Murray followup uh thank you madam chair
 
02:48:23.429 --> 02:48:23.439 align:start position:0%
um and is there a list of of allowable
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
costs for reimbursements there there are
 
02:48:29.830 --> 02:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
and um some some of the things really
 
02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
become frustrating that people will uh
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
submit and in some cases when they
 
02:48:37.870 --> 02:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
haven't been seized questionable as to
 
02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
why it's even happening quite frankly um
 
02:48:42.510 --> 02:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
there have been animals that have been
 
02:48:44.750 --> 02:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
seized and are still under the the
 
02:48:48.830 --> 02:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
ownership of the uh the person who they
 
02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
were seized from and those animals have
 
02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
been spayed or neutered uh that's
 
02:48:55.349 --> 02:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
certainly not a
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursable expense uh and probably
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have taken place at all others
 
02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
are like vaccinations for rabies which
 
02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
is not an
 
02:49:08.510 --> 02:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
emergency per se so we do have a list
 
02:49:12.030 --> 02:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
and we do have a an amount not to exceed
 
02:49:14.469 --> 02:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
so if some rescue comes in and wants to
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
charge more than what's on the list they
 
02:49:18.750 --> 02:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
don't get reimbursed for that so this
 
02:49:20.750 --> 02:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
this is not something that is just
 
02:49:23.670 --> 02:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
whatever you think you know you should
 
02:49:26.710 --> 02:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
do know you have to make choices on how
 
02:49:29.710 --> 02:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
you want to care for those those animals
 
02:49:32.309 --> 02:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
um because this is not just whatever you
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
want to do followup and thank you and so
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
and just so I'm clear this is available
 
02:49:41.269 --> 02:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
to anything from a bunny to a
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
horse uh yes yeah okay representative
 
02:49:48.750 --> 02:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
Penza so I have a couple questions first
 
02:49:51.710 --> 02:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you to representative Bixby cuz um
 
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
some of us that are new didn't
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
understand the history so I thank you
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
for that backstory um just off the top
 
02:50:00.269 --> 02:50:00.279 align:start position:0%
of your head doesn't need to be an exact
 
02:50:02.429 --> 02:50:02.439 align:start position:0%
number can you tell me how much that
 
02:50:05.309 --> 02:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
whole great Daye incident cost well
 
02:50:09.229 --> 02:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
that didn't cost us anything but it was
 
02:50:10.429 --> 02:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
again I'm going to say that I think
 
02:50:16.910 --> 02:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
there were charges that were incurred
 
02:50:18.429 --> 02:50:18.439 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't have been paid from here
 
02:50:21.389 --> 02:50:21.399 align:start position:0%
that was in I I want to say and maybe
 
02:50:23.469 --> 02:50:23.479 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has a better memory
 
02:50:25.990 --> 02:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
I want to say it they were saying it was
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
close to a half a million
 
02:50:34.670 --> 02:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
dollars uh the uh the HS USA said that
 
02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
they spent $3 million
 
02:50:41.670 --> 02:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
what and and one of the reasons that we
 
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
put a lot of Department oversight in the
 
02:50:47.309 --> 02:50:47.319 align:start position:0%
cost of care fund is because we were a
 
02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
little bit dubious
 
02:50:52.750 --> 02:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
yeah they were they were charging for
 
02:50:54.670 --> 02:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
people from their National Organization
 
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
to fly back and forth and I'm assuming
 
02:51:00.429 --> 02:51:00.439 align:start position:0%
that they were including hotel rooms and
 
02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
and and things like that so there were a
 
02:51:05.070 --> 02:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
lot of things going on in what they were
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
saying was the cost that we would never
 
02:51:14.150 --> 02:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
allow in this fund okay couple um so
 
02:51:17.150 --> 02:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
then my other question has to do with um
 
02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
the amount so you said there's over
 
02:51:25.630 --> 02:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
500,000 in there so if um let's say um
 
02:51:28.349 --> 02:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
is there a point where it we don't keep
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
putting into the fund and if we draw off
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
the fund does that go back into General
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
funds how does that work it's a
 
02:51:38.349 --> 02:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
budgetary item so it would be capped at
 
02:51:41.389 --> 02:51:41.399 align:start position:0%
2 million so what I would expect is I
 
02:51:43.710 --> 02:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
and I am quite confident I will not be
 
02:51:45.670 --> 02:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner when the fund gets to $2
 
02:51:48.110 --> 02:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
million but what a commissioner would do
 
02:51:51.030 --> 02:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
is looking at the budget saying okay our
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
rate of spend has been x amount and if
 
02:51:57.710 --> 02:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
we put y amount in will be over 200 and
 
02:52:02.349 --> 02:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
would just request a smaller amount um
 
02:52:05.429 --> 02:52:05.439 align:start position:0%
but what I would also assume is then
 
02:52:08.630 --> 02:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
that you are correct if that in fact
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
there had been more money budgeted
 
02:52:13.269 --> 02:52:13.279 align:start position:0%
there's going to be that safeguard that
 
02:52:16.269 --> 02:52:16.279 align:start position:0%
uh simply the treasury is not going to
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
put the money into the fund okay
 
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
last real quick question sure why um why
 
02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't we have this Act take effect
 
02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
immediately and not 60
 
02:52:29.269 --> 02:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
days uh I would be perfectly happy with
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
an amendment to um to have it take
 
02:52:35.229 --> 02:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
effect immediately there was just I
 
02:52:37.710 --> 02:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
didn't see that no and and this is
 
02:52:41.269 --> 02:52:41.279 align:start position:0%
typical legislation saying 60 days this
 
02:52:43.950 --> 02:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
is one that there's no need to notify
 
02:52:46.750 --> 02:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
anybody there's no need to to wait for
 
02:52:50.429 --> 02:52:50.439 align:start position:0%
60 days so um I I see absolutely no
 
02:52:52.670 --> 02:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
reason not to amend that to take effect
 
02:52:55.590 --> 02:52:55.600 align:start position:0%
upon passage thank you thank you
 
02:52:58.030 --> 02:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
representative cron and then
 
02:53:00.389 --> 02:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
Bixby uh thank you ma'am thank you
 
02:53:02.550 --> 02:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner just to make sure I got it
 
02:53:06.429 --> 02:53:06.439 align:start position:0%
straight in my head so the town seizes
 
02:53:09.469 --> 02:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
an animal sends it to SPCA or whoever
 
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
they send it to for care currently the
 
02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
town doesn't have the budget to do that
 
02:53:17.150 --> 02:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
so they go to this fund so I'm sorry
 
02:53:19.110 --> 02:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
there's so much no town town does not
 
02:53:21.229 --> 02:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
have a budget for it so the state gives
 
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
them the money no so that's that is the
 
02:53:26.590 --> 02:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
current problem well that's what I'm
 
02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
saying that's the current I mean but the
 
02:53:30.670 --> 02:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
town can't take that money to transfer
 
02:53:32.630 --> 02:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
it to that organization and even if we
 
02:53:35.150 --> 02:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
wrote them a check yeah say there was a
 
02:53:37.429 --> 02:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
billing for $50,000 and we wrote them a
 
02:53:38.670 --> 02:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
check for
 
02:53:41.590 --> 02:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
$50,000 under the municipal budget act
 
02:53:44.790 --> 02:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
that $50,000 would be seen as
 
02:53:46.990 --> 02:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
unanticipated revenue and they still
 
02:53:50.429 --> 02:53:50.439 align:start position:0%
would not have a budget line item to pay
 
02:53:52.870 --> 02:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
that $50,000 couldn't do it okay I got
 
02:53:56.110 --> 02:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
so that that's the problem and frankly
 
02:53:57.389 --> 02:53:57.399 align:start position:0%
you know I should have caught it
 
02:53:59.309 --> 02:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
somebody should have caught it I got you
 
02:54:02.950 --> 02:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
but here we arees representative Bixby
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a just a a minor technical
 
02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
thing so
 
02:54:10.830 --> 02:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
the the line where the the knocking the
 
02:54:13.510 --> 02:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian out of the review
 
02:54:17.229 --> 02:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
that is it it's typical in legislation
 
02:54:19.150 --> 02:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner get charged with
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
doing absolutely all of the work and it
 
02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
is assumed that uh the commissioner will
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
then assign that to the appropriate
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
person in the department right exactly
 
02:54:31.190 --> 02:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
what happens with this is the state
 
02:54:33.950 --> 02:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
veterinarian does his review of it um
 
02:54:36.389 --> 02:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
makes a recommendation to me and I sign
 
02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
off on it I mean this actually sets up a
 
02:54:41.590 --> 02:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
legislative problem where the two of us
 
02:54:43.950 --> 02:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
could disagree and perhaps nothing would
 
02:54:45.750 --> 02:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
get done because it doesn't give the
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
authority to anybody to make the
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
decision this anticipates that we would
 
02:54:54.429 --> 02:54:54.439 align:start position:0%
both agree on everything and that's not
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
typical uh what is typical is that there
 
02:54:59.630 --> 02:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
is one person who is responsible for
 
02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
making a decision so a decision can be
 
02:55:03.750 --> 02:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
made if there were three involved okay
 
02:55:06.030 --> 02:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
that might be different
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
but um but even then okay any other
 
02:55:11.469 --> 02:55:11.479 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
02:55:13.710 --> 02:55:13.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner seeing none thank you very
 
02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:16.000 align:start position:0%

02:55:18.910 --> 02:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon and I call Heather Faria from
 
02:55:36.910 --> 02:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:39.550 --> 02:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
organizations good afternoon uh thank
 
02:55:41.269 --> 02:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
you for hearing my testimony Madam chair
 
02:55:43.510 --> 02:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
02:55:46.510 --> 02:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
Heather Faria I am the vice president of
 
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Federation of Humane
 
02:55:50.269 --> 02:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
organ organizations and the executive
 
02:55:52.469 --> 02:55:52.479 align:start position:0%
director of the Pope Memorial SPCA here
 
02:55:52.479 --> 02:55:53.190 align:start position:0%
director of the Pope Memorial SPCA here
in

02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:55:55.550 --> 02:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
conquer uh the New Hampshire Federation
 
02:55:56.830 --> 02:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
of Humane
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
organizations um we are um a group of
 
02:56:03.550 --> 02:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rescues SPCA and Humane
 
02:56:05.750 --> 02:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
Societies often partnered with
 
02:56:08.750 --> 02:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and charged with taking
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
care of animals um in the situation that
 
02:56:13.790 --> 02:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
you just heard the commissioner describe
 
02:56:15.750 --> 02:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
so through our Municipal Partnerships we
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
often take custody of animals that have
 
02:56:19.550 --> 02:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
been seized
 
02:56:22.389 --> 02:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
um and we provide the care that has been
 
02:56:24.750 --> 02:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
requested for the duration of
 
02:56:26.830 --> 02:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
Investigations and trials through the
 
02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:27.710 align:start position:0%
Investigations and trials through the
final

02:56:27.710 --> 02:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
final
 
02:56:30.790 --> 02:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
dissolution um so we are those third
 
02:56:32.710 --> 02:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
parties that would potentially be
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
awaiting payment um so what this bill
 
02:56:38.229 --> 02:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
would allow is um for the payment to
 
02:56:40.710 --> 02:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
come directly to us um really that's the
 
02:56:42.550 --> 02:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
only change so the municipality would
 
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
still be charged with completing the
 
02:56:46.830 --> 02:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
application providing all the proper
 
02:56:48.190 --> 02:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
documentation meeting the requ
 
02:56:50.630 --> 02:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
requirements of the application it would
 
02:56:53.070 --> 02:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
simply allow the funds to come directly
 
02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
to us rather than back to the
 
02:56:57.429 --> 02:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
municipality and then through their
 
02:56:59.469 --> 02:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
process and to us as the commissioner
 
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
described um we are obviously as you
 
02:57:03.790 --> 02:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
would anticipate very much in favor of
 
02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and hope that you would
 
02:57:08.309 --> 02:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
consider uh passing it and I'd be happy
 
02:57:10.830 --> 02:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you uh
 
02:57:13.429 --> 02:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
representa Murray thank you m Madam
 
02:57:14.630 --> 02:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:57:18.190 --> 02:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
question is there a situation that I I
 
02:57:19.309 --> 02:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure if if a
 
02:57:21.110 --> 02:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement came to you then would you
 
02:57:23.269 --> 02:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
then notify the town or M municipality
 
02:57:25.630 --> 02:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
that you've received reimbursement and
 
02:57:25.640 --> 02:57:28.070 align:start position:0%
that you've received reimbursement and
you're

02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:57:30.110 --> 02:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
expecting I I'm just trying to figure
 
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
out because a bill would have been sent
 
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
right to the municipality of for
 
02:57:36.710 --> 02:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
something sure and so sorry yep go ahead
 
02:57:38.190 --> 02:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
so it' be like any other bill you would
 
02:57:40.550 --> 02:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
receive we would Bill them they would
 
02:57:42.190 --> 02:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
understand that there's an outstanding
 
02:57:45.030 --> 02:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
balance and when we receive payment um
 
02:57:46.590 --> 02:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
we would send we would send them notice
 
02:57:48.269 --> 02:57:48.279 align:start position:0%
like you would if you when you pay
 
02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
something you receive notice that that
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
has been paid and so um that would be
 
02:57:56.110 --> 02:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
standard um for them to
 
02:57:58.670 --> 02:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
know any other
 
02:58:01.910 --> 02:58:01.920 align:start position:0%

02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
this um cost of care is to us to keep
 
02:58:55.510 --> 02:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
tabs on and make sure that it's going to
 
02:58:58.309 --> 02:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
work to its fullest extent uh
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper covered covered it
 
02:59:04.190 --> 02:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
very well uh representative Bixby talked
 
02:59:06.150 --> 02:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
a lot about the history of the need of
 
02:59:08.630 --> 02:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
it and I can answer more questions
 
02:59:11.790 --> 02:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
related to that because it actually goes
 
02:59:17.429 --> 02:59:17.439 align:start position:0%
back to um the 2008 report that the
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
governor's Comm Mission did on the cost
 
02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
analysis of animal cruelty in New
 
02:59:24.429 --> 02:59:24.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it was at that time that
 
02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
we recognized that many
 
02:59:31.229 --> 02:59:31.239 align:start position:0%
towns were hesitant to pursue cruelty
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
cases to their fullest because of the
 
02:59:37.389 --> 02:59:37.399 align:start position:0%
cost to the towns and this is both with
 
02:59:39.670 --> 02:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
um primarily
 
02:59:42.790 --> 02:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
with large numbers of animals hoarding
 
02:59:44.590 --> 02:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
cases and things like that because that
 
02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
can just break the budget um to even
 
02:59:50.309 --> 02:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
some of the more expensive single or
 
02:59:53.710 --> 02:59:53.720 align:start position:0%
double animals um where a town did not
 
02:59:56.710 --> 02:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
have anything budgeted for any of this
 
02:59:59.309 --> 02:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
it can break the bank and we found that
 
03:00:02.429 --> 03:00:02.439 align:start position:0%
they were often um actually leaving
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
animals in the custody of the owner when
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have been to save the
 
03:00:11.349 --> 03:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
town money um we found that um often
 
03:00:12.990 --> 03:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
times they
 
03:00:15.750 --> 03:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
were not Prosecuting they were getting
 
03:00:18.030 --> 03:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
the people to turn over the animals and
 
03:00:20.389 --> 03:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
not prosecute just so that they could
 
03:00:23.790 --> 03:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
not have to pay long term um for the
 
03:00:27.710 --> 03:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
care of the animals so we were
 
03:00:30.510 --> 03:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
um worked on trying to figure out ways
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
to do this and and your committee was uh
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
the one that got it passed and we were
 
03:00:40.110 --> 03:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
very anxious um and happy that that was
 
03:00:44.229 --> 03:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
done um it was a lot of work we had been
 
03:00:46.150 --> 03:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
through years of discussion about this
 
03:00:48.990 --> 03:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
and how to do it um we were looking at
 
03:00:54.429 --> 03:00:54.439 align:start position:0%
the um the the victims compensation laws
 
03:00:55.950 --> 03:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
we were looking at a lot of different
 
03:00:58.510 --> 03:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
things to come up with this so uh
 
03:01:00.309 --> 03:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper's been very good and
 
03:01:03.389 --> 03:01:03.399 align:start position:0%
shared with us some of the applications
 
03:01:06.150 --> 03:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
and what's going on and um we'll
 
03:01:08.030 --> 03:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
continue to do so so that we can kind of
 
03:01:10.269 --> 03:01:10.279 align:start position:0%
te cabs on this but it did become
 
03:01:13.910 --> 03:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
apparent that this extra step or extra
 
03:01:15.910 --> 03:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
two steps because sometimes there's more
 
03:01:20.670 --> 03:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
than one third party in involved um so
 
03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
that uh it'll help tremendously to have
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
the process work better because the town
 
03:01:29.750 --> 03:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to have any initial output
 
03:01:31.870 --> 03:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
it can go directly to the third
 
03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
parties thank you any
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Murray uh thank
 
03:01:41.269 --> 03:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:43.309 --> 03:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure that I'm
 
03:01:45.469 --> 03:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
clear in the accounting portion of this
 
03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
if you're saying there's could be one or
 
03:01:50.030 --> 03:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
two third party entities that then could
 
03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:50.830 align:start position:0%
two third party entities that then could
be

03:01:50.830 --> 03:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:01:53.190 --> 03:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursed um is it is there any
 
03:01:54.630 --> 03:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
there where's that oversight being held
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
is that at the department level or is
 
03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
that then at the cost of care fund or
 
03:02:03.469 --> 03:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
the way that the application is there
 
03:02:05.429 --> 03:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
has to be receipts sent in for
 
03:02:08.309 --> 03:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
everything and that's still going to be
 
03:02:11.389 --> 03:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the town but let's
 
03:02:14.030 --> 03:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
say that the animals are housed in a
 
03:02:16.269 --> 03:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
humane society that doesn't have a
 
03:02:18.830 --> 03:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
veterinarian but in a veterinarian needs
 
03:02:22.269 --> 03:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
to go in and do some emergency work
 
03:02:24.030 --> 03:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
there may be two bills one from the
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
Humane Society or shelter and one from
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian so that the cost of
 
03:02:32.590 --> 03:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
care fund could pay each individually
 
03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
rather than reimburse the town and then
 
03:02:36.670 --> 03:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
have the town have to figure out how to
 
03:02:39.469 --> 03:02:39.479 align:start position:0%
pay those two third parties
 
03:02:44.110 --> 03:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
or okay any other questions from the
 
03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee no seeing none thank you
 
03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it is there anyone else who
 
03:02:52.670 --> 03:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:55.710 --> 03:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
bill okay we got the blue
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%

have two in favor and none
 
03:03:14.110 --> 03:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
opposed with that I'm going to close out
 
03:03:19.870 --> 03:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:19.880 --> 03:03:20.810 align:start position:0%

agricultural Community they were there
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
for us now they need us the legislature
 
03:05:31.550 --> 03:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
to be there for them livestock producers
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
all across the us including here in New
 
03:05:35.229 --> 03:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are dealing with a serious
 
03:05:38.030 --> 03:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
shortage of large and food animal
 
03:05:40.349 --> 03:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
veterinarians according to the USDA in
 
03:05:43.389 --> 03:05:43.399 align:start position:0%
2023 the shortage of rural veterinarians
 
03:05:45.429 --> 03:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
has reached an all-time high with 500
 
03:05:48.309 --> 03:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
counties in 46 States deemed as having a
 
03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
critical shortage of large animal vets
 
03:05:53.070 --> 03:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
the shortfall posed poses risk not only
 
03:05:54.750 --> 03:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
to livestock and Farmers but the
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
country's food supply unfortunately it
 
03:05:58.790 --> 03:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
looks like the shortage is only going to
 
03:06:00.389 --> 03:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
deepen as a pipeline for new
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
veterinarians especially those who
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
specialize in large and agricultural

past six months I have been engaged in
 
03:06:09.630 --> 03:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
conversations about how to address New
 
03:06:11.070 --> 03:06:11.080 align:start position:0%

state with even less access to Services
 
03:06:25.830 --> 03:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
I learned recently that a large animal
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarian practice in my district is
 
03:06:29.710 --> 03:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
preparing to close we need both a
 
03:06:32.309 --> 03:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
short-term and a long-term approach over
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
the past few months I have engaged
 
03:06:35.229 --> 03:06:35.239 align:start position:0%

long-term solution the role of veter
 
03:06:49.110 --> 03:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
Aran text in the field was a point of
 
03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
consensus and at and that we may be able
 
03:06:53.830 --> 03:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
to enhance their roles to create some re
 
03:06:55.269 --> 03:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
relief for the large animal

to study the Vette Tech role and
 
03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities that could benefit the
 
03:07:03.429 --> 03:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
system of care for our large animals our
 
03:07:05.670 --> 03:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
food animals this bill includes key
 
03:07:06.750 --> 03:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
questions about the current and
 
03:07:08.990 --> 03:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
potential future role and who we need
 
03:07:10.510 --> 03:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
Who We Believe needs to be at the table

Bureau thank you madam chair members of
 
03:08:30.269 --> 03:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record Rob Johnson
 
03:08:32.030 --> 03:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire farmer
 
03:08:34.830 --> 03:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
was a federation's policy director and
 
03:08:39.309 --> 03:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
we we uh do support uh Senate Bill 545
 
03:08:42.550 --> 03:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
we we have worked with Senate Apprentice
 
03:08:44.190 --> 03:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
on the bill I'll kind of start with
 
03:08:46.309 --> 03:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
answering representative Dix's question
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
first I just ask you to move the
 
03:08:50.710 --> 03:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
microphone closer thank you excuse me
 
03:08:53.469 --> 03:08:53.479 align:start position:0%
the the bill is introduced uh
 
03:08:56.750 --> 03:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
established a uh large animal veterinary
 
03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
incentive uh payment program and the
 
03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
goal of such programs are to incentivize
 
03:09:04.389 --> 03:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
large animal veterinary veterinarians to
 
03:09:07.309 --> 03:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
practice in an underserved area uh
 
03:09:09.190 --> 03:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
Senator apprentices bill incentivized
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to practice in the
 
03:09:12.910 --> 03:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state by
 
03:09:14.670 --> 03:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursing a percentage of their
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
veterinary school tuition if they agreed
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
to practice in the region for a period
 
03:09:20.710 --> 03:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
of time and I believe the the bills
 
03:09:24.750 --> 03:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
introduced was a a 20% payment for each
 
03:09:28.469 --> 03:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
three years that they agreed uh as there
 
03:09:31.110 --> 03:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
is a similar Federal program already
 
03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
being funded that has not been utilized
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it was it was our uh
 
03:09:41.429 --> 03:09:41.439 align:start position:0%
agreement that is introduced it had
 
03:09:43.870 --> 03:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
little chance of moving forward so when
 
03:09:46.469 --> 03:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
it's place the senator introduced this
 
03:09:50.349 --> 03:09:50.359 align:start position:0%
bill after consult with us we uh our
 
03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
president Joyce Brady has named a group
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a we'll call it a task
 
03:09:58.269 --> 03:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
force that initially met this past fall
 
03:09:59.910 --> 03:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
with a representative from the New
 
03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire VMA a representative from the
 
03:10:08.030 --> 03:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
the uh uh uh the uh what's the group I
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
want to say the the vet tax Association
 
03:10:14.269 --> 03:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
the state veterinarian uh number of our
 
03:10:16.349 --> 03:10:16.359 align:start position:0%
leaders and some of their veterinarians
 
03:10:18.269 --> 03:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
kind of just spit fball looking at this
 
03:10:20.750 --> 03:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
issue what can we do and this and that
 
03:10:23.750 --> 03:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
and this was one of the the ideas that
 
03:10:26.309 --> 03:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
had come up we had the a couple of our
 
03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
members their veterinarians have
 
03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
suggested that maybe the The Lure of vet
 
03:10:34.750 --> 03:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
Tex would uh the thought being would
 
03:10:36.990 --> 03:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
provide a higher level of training that
 
03:10:39.349 --> 03:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
would make veterinarians more
 
03:10:41.309 --> 03:10:41.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable in in giving these
 
03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
technicians greater responsibilities
 
03:10:44.429 --> 03:10:44.439 align:start position:0%
because in the end they're working
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
basically off of the the veterinarians
 
03:10:49.229 --> 03:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
licenses at least as I understand it and
 
03:10:51.150 --> 03:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
we and now all this would help reduce
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
the the vet vets workload and you know I
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
we've heard from we've heard some
 
03:10:58.950 --> 03:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
veterinarians who tell us it's not going
 
03:11:00.389 --> 03:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
to help and we've heard others that
 
03:11:02.389 --> 03:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea so that's why we
 
03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
said well let's study it let's get all
 
03:11:05.910 --> 03:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
the players in a in a room and really
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
take a look at that to see if it will do
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
anything so that that's that's where it
 
03:11:11.630 --> 03:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
came about and just let me give you a
 
03:11:13.790 --> 03:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of background on the whole
 
03:11:16.349 --> 03:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
this whole vet shortage and I as as
 
03:11:20.030 --> 03:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Apprentice said in her uh remarks
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
that were read that this is not unique
 
03:11:23.670 --> 03:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire it's not it's
 
03:11:25.790 --> 03:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
Nationwide and it's it's isn't something
 
03:11:27.349 --> 03:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
that just happened overnight it's been
 
03:11:32.110 --> 03:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
been ongoing but um I was looking at a a
 
03:11:34.510 --> 03:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's an agricultural consultant firm
 
03:11:36.990 --> 03:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
that that it's the Van Trump report that
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
that is that is widely read and they had
 
03:11:42.349 --> 03:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
an article a few months back entitled
 
03:11:44.830 --> 03:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
America's large animal veterinarian
 
03:11:47.790 --> 03:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
shortage is barreling towards crisis
 
03:11:51.750 --> 03:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
levels uh to give you an idea and and it
 
03:11:54.150 --> 03:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
and it cites a report that was authored
 
03:11:57.429 --> 03:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
in 2022 by a Cornell University
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
Economist Clinton yel uh and which he he
 
03:12:02.190 --> 03:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
put together for the farm Journal
 
03:12:04.229 --> 03:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
Foundation that found that only about 3
 
03:12:07.550 --> 03:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
to 4% of new veterinary school graduates
 
03:12:10.309 --> 03:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
pursue livestock or other food Animal
 
03:12:13.429 --> 03:12:13.439 align:start position:0%
Practice areas 40 years ago that number
 
03:12:17.630 --> 03:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
was 40% just 40 years ago
 
03:12:20.309 --> 03:12:20.319 align:start position:0%
in 2003 the
 
03:12:24.590 --> 03:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
avma uh statistics show that of the
 
03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:31.790 align:start position:0%
avma uh statistics show that of the
82,791

03:12:31.790 --> 03:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:35.429 --> 03:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
per practice primarily delivering care
 
03:12:39.030 --> 03:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
to animals raised for food food or Fiber
 
03:12:43.870 --> 03:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
another 4.1% practice uh uh delivering
 
03:12:46.389 --> 03:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
care to equids to equines donkeys that
 
03:12:46.399 --> 03:12:47.830 align:start position:0%
care to equids to equines donkeys that
type

03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
type
 
03:12:51.389 --> 03:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
uh another seven and a half percent are
 
03:12:54.389 --> 03:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
are are dual practice companion and
 
03:12:57.830 --> 03:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
large animal while a a vast majority
 
03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
over 70% uh primarily practice uh
 
03:13:06.150 --> 03:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
delivering to equin uh uh the equin
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
community why is the
 
03:13:11.870 --> 03:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
shortage on average veterinary school
 
03:13:13.910 --> 03:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
graduates finish school nearly
 
03:13:17.870 --> 03:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
$200,000 in debt the better pay in more
 
03:13:20.110 --> 03:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable work hours that go with a
 
03:13:22.150 --> 03:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
practice focusing primarily or
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
exclusively on companion animals is
 
03:13:28.030 --> 03:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
attractive to a profession having the
 
03:13:29.990 --> 03:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
added stress of dealing with animal
 
03:13:32.429 --> 03:13:32.439 align:start position:0%
owners in life and death s situations on
 
03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
a regular basis there's a physical toll
 
03:13:38.590 --> 03:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
experience working with large animals
 
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
not to mention inherent
 
03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
dangers a mental toll also from
 
03:13:45.750 --> 03:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
exhaustion and working a regular hours
 
03:13:47.229 --> 03:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
day and night especially when you're
 
03:13:49.070 --> 03:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with you know emergencies that
 
03:13:51.790 --> 03:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
that that many livestock owners have on
 
03:13:54.790 --> 03:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
occasion uh as well as a considerable
 
03:13:57.469 --> 03:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
amount of of driving time in rural areas
 
03:13:59.070 --> 03:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
as veterinarians when they're talking to
 
03:14:01.469 --> 03:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
tell they call it windshield
 
03:14:03.870 --> 03:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
time you know um and driving to these
 
03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
appointments make days even longer all
 
03:14:09.790 --> 03:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
this easily leads to burnout in the
 
03:14:12.510 --> 03:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
industry both from the job and just the
 
03:14:14.269 --> 03:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
lifestyle in
 
03:14:19.870 --> 03:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
general also a factor is that 63% of of
 
03:14:23.190 --> 03:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
vet school graduates are female while
 
03:14:25.429 --> 03:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
37% are
 
03:14:28.349 --> 03:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
men as an oldtime veterinarian said to
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
me not long ago women are a lot smarter
 
03:14:34.910 --> 03:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
than us men they value work life balance
 
03:14:37.590 --> 03:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
as they should and realize they can make
 
03:14:41.429 --> 03:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
double the money caring for companion
 
03:14:43.590 --> 03:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
animals Madam chair I'll leave it at
 
03:14:46.429 --> 03:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
that and we ask that you approve this
 
03:14:48.269 --> 03:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
study thank
 
03:14:50.990 --> 03:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the
 
03:14:53.670 --> 03:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative H Haskins thank
 
03:14:55.710 --> 03:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I don't know if you can
 
03:14:57.950 --> 03:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
answer this uh and it may not be
 
03:15:00.670 --> 03:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
Germaine but I think I read that there's
 
03:15:03.229 --> 03:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
a conglomeration going on where
 
03:15:06.110 --> 03:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
corporate entities are buying up small
 
03:15:09.229 --> 03:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
Veterinary practices is this does this
 
03:15:12.269 --> 03:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
feed into the problem do you know I
 
03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
believe it's a
 
03:15:17.309 --> 03:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
factor um that that's something
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
we are trying to look at actually our
 
03:15:21.070 --> 03:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
our organization New Hampshire Farm
 
03:15:23.070 --> 03:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau we adopted a resolution this past
 
03:15:26.189 --> 03:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
year asking our National Organization to
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
to uh actually put some pressure on USDA
 
03:15:31.469 --> 03:15:31.479 align:start position:0%
to conduct a study on that very issue
 
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we the reason we asked for USDA to
 
03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
do it uh years ago USDA conducted a
 
03:15:39.349 --> 03:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
study a separate issue but a rural
 
03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
healthc care and and so we thought well
 
03:15:43.750 --> 03:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
this is similar only with animals so and
 
03:15:45.950 --> 03:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
they have the resources to do it but yes
 
03:15:47.950 --> 03:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
I think the that's a excellent question
 
03:15:49.590 --> 03:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
I think I think it probably is a factor
 
03:15:51.469 --> 03:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
in in certain regards representative
 
03:15:54.150 --> 03:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah I have a small technical
 
03:15:57.630 --> 03:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
question which I don't uh I mentioned it
 
03:16:01.070 --> 03:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
to rep to Senator Pearl um and but I
 
03:16:02.790 --> 03:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if uh this is something that
 
03:16:06.349 --> 03:16:06.359 align:start position:0%
you would weigh in or not we weigh in on
 
03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
or not but uh the as written uh the bill
 
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
from the Senate says that it's going to
 
03:16:17.590 --> 03:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
be a thre member study committee uh and
 
03:16:20.550 --> 03:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering if there would be any
 
03:16:23.189 --> 03:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
objection to making that for members so
 
03:16:24.790 --> 03:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
that a three- member committee with a
 
03:16:28.469 --> 03:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
three- member Quorum would uh and that
 
03:16:30.309 --> 03:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
seem the three members three member
 
03:16:32.590 --> 03:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
Quorum seems like a recipe for failed
 
03:16:34.830 --> 03:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
meetings and by adding another member I
 
03:16:36.189 --> 03:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
think we might be able to make that a
 
03:16:38.830 --> 03:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more resilient no objection
 
03:16:42.630 --> 03:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay represent
 
03:16:48.349 --> 03:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
Katon thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:16:50.229 --> 03:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
for Testimony what I what I didn't know
 
03:16:52.389 --> 03:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
was that you had tapped my phone when I
 
03:16:55.309 --> 03:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
was talking to my daughter she graduated
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
from vet school and loves horses but is
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
not working with horses um my question
 
03:17:04.670 --> 03:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
though is on your on this subcommittee
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
what would you envision as an outcome
 
03:17:09.309 --> 03:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
what what would you expect them to come
 
03:17:09.319 --> 03:17:10.150 align:start position:0%
what what would you expect them to come
back

03:17:10.150 --> 03:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:17:13.510 --> 03:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
with i i conceptually yeah a
 
03:17:15.389 --> 03:17:15.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation of whether or not it
 
03:17:17.469 --> 03:17:17.479 align:start position:0%
makes sense to pursue licens
 
03:17:20.030 --> 03:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
of of that tax there there is licensure
 
03:17:24.110 --> 03:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
in some states uh but for a followup
 
03:17:25.469 --> 03:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
that's that's the core of what we're
 
03:17:27.429 --> 03:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
we're looking for and then and that
 
03:17:29.309 --> 03:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
licensure would
 
03:17:32.349 --> 03:17:32.359 align:start position:0%
gain what capability that we don't have
 
03:17:34.910 --> 03:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
now yeah that the I guess the the the
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
thinking at least from some of the
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
discussions some of our members we've
 
03:17:41.269 --> 03:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
had with with veterinarians it would be
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
a a higher level of training the
 
03:17:45.189 --> 03:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
certification that would make
 
03:17:47.550 --> 03:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
veterinarians feel more comfortable
 
03:17:49.870 --> 03:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
in in um
 
03:17:54.229 --> 03:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh giving responsibility to the vet Tex
 
03:17:55.469 --> 03:17:55.479 align:start position:0%
because really that the techs are
 
03:17:57.070 --> 03:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
working under the veterinarian's license
 
03:17:58.750 --> 03:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
and if they have that extra training you
 
03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
know liability wise and that type of
 
03:18:03.070 --> 03:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
thing that that's the thought process
 
03:18:04.910 --> 03:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
behind it whether that's true or not
 
03:18:07.550 --> 03:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's why they kind studying right Goa
 
03:18:07.560 --> 03:18:09.070 align:start position:0%
that's why they kind studying right Goa
okay

03:18:09.070 --> 03:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:18:11.870 --> 03:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
smart thank you madam chair uh in the
 
03:18:18.389 --> 03:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
states that do require LIC for vetex how
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
many of those vetex are actually working
 
03:18:23.030 --> 03:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
with um agriculture animals yeah that
 
03:18:24.269 --> 03:18:24.279 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question I couldn't tell
 
03:18:27.030 --> 03:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
you I couldn't even tell you how many
 
03:18:28.790 --> 03:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
states I haven't looked at it studied it
 
03:18:33.070 --> 03:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
how many are have licensure
 
03:18:43.550 --> 03:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:46.990 --> 03:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
at representative ktoa thank than you
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair and uh thank you for taking
 
03:18:52.189 --> 03:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
my question it's kind of question
 
03:18:56.630 --> 03:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
comment type uh deal so currently in the
 
03:18:58.150 --> 03:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we have a
 
03:19:00.070 --> 03:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
shortage of veterinarians whether it
 
03:19:03.070 --> 03:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
being small animal or large animal I do
 
03:19:06.349 --> 03:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
believe would you say that is
 
03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
correct I haven't I don't know about the
 
03:19:12.790 --> 03:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh companion animal that there may well
 
03:19:15.910 --> 03:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
be but I there is it's it's it's
 
03:19:15.920 --> 03:19:17.229 align:start position:0%
be but I there is it's it's it's
certainly

03:19:17.229 --> 03:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:19:20.429 --> 03:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's of the magnitude of
 
03:19:23.229 --> 03:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
the large animal at least from what I've
 
03:19:25.950 --> 03:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
heard I know that our members who are
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding a a a
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
veterinarian veteran service it's with
 
03:19:33.110 --> 03:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
their their livestock not with their
 
03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
companion animals okay um and thank you
 
03:19:38.830 --> 03:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
for that and obviously I mean I
 
03:19:42.309 --> 03:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
understand uh the value of uh large
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
animal vet I mean there is no amount of
 
03:19:49.229 --> 03:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
money that um uh someone that has one uh
 
03:19:51.309 --> 03:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
can actually put on uh when they need
 
03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
the care and uh personally uh having my
 
03:19:58.189 --> 03:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
vet come out on 4th of July on a Sunday
 
03:20:01.950 --> 03:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
or at midnight uh when it's freezing uh
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
to to care for an animal is just amazing
 
03:20:07.349 --> 03:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
and so I can understand why a lot of
 
03:20:11.830 --> 03:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
people uh kind of cater to the enclosed
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
climate controlled uh Companion Animal
 
03:20:19.389 --> 03:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
um when looking at this do you think
 
03:20:22.990 --> 03:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
that um currently a licens your system
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
may look something similar to the
 
03:20:27.309 --> 03:20:27.319 align:start position:0%
nursing program where you could have
 
03:20:30.950 --> 03:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
like a lower Tech than kind of like the
 
03:20:34.189 --> 03:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
LNA the RNA you know it kind of like a
 
03:20:38.469 --> 03:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
stepping stone um and maybe not
 
03:20:39.790 --> 03:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
everything has to be done through
 
03:20:41.309 --> 03:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
schooling but could be done through
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
experience because I think
 
03:20:46.150 --> 03:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
experience um especially from a highly
 
03:20:50.110 --> 03:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
trained veterinarian goes a long way um
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
because nothing can be said for
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
experience uh do you see the committee
 
03:20:56.750 --> 03:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
looking at a structure similar to that c
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
certainly uh it's interesting you you
 
03:21:02.030 --> 03:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
asked that question because recently I
 
03:21:03.590 --> 03:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
was talking with somebody about this
 
03:21:06.510 --> 03:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
issue and and they mentioned one concern
 
03:21:10.030 --> 03:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
that some texts they've heard have is
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
that that the the in effect by having
 
03:21:16.150 --> 03:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
license your own State de facto it's a
 
03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:17.510 align:start position:0%
license your own State de facto it's a
requirement

03:21:17.510 --> 03:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
and and would so would there be the
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
ability I don't know if it's that way in
 
03:21:22.110 --> 03:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
other states that have it if there is
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
the ability to be you know be a license
 
03:21:25.830 --> 03:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
vet teet an non-licensed vet tech I I
 
03:21:27.429 --> 03:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
don't know that's Again part of the
 
03:21:29.790 --> 03:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
reason that we're looking at the
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
study Madam chair if you I have one more
 
03:21:33.870 --> 03:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
item I can mention to you that that kind
 
03:21:35.389 --> 03:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
of maybe lends a little bit of Hope to
 
03:21:39.309 --> 03:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
this whole issue um that just recently
 
03:21:42.309 --> 03:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
the the avma the American vet Medical
 
03:21:46.269 --> 03:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
Association uh if I can find it here
 
03:21:46.279 --> 03:21:47.110 align:start position:0%
Association uh if I can find it here
which

03:21:47.110 --> 03:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:21:49.150 --> 03:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
uh they are responsible for accrediting
 
03:21:51.830 --> 03:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Schools they they had
 
03:21:54.670 --> 03:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
a was a press release where they
 
03:21:57.269 --> 03:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
announced that there are 14 proposed new
 
03:21:59.910 --> 03:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
veterinary colleges around the country
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
and and you may say well that's not that
 
03:22:04.229 --> 03:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
many but when you think we only have 33
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
now uh 14 and even if half of them uh go
 
03:22:09.070 --> 03:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
through the process would really be a
 
03:22:11.510 --> 03:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
boom so there is a array of Hope though
 
03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's down the road a
 
03:22:16.269 --> 03:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
bit good to know all right any other
 
03:22:18.710 --> 03:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
questions questions for uh Mr
 
03:22:21.389 --> 03:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
Johnson seeing none thank you very much
 
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
for your testimony is there anyone else
 
03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
who wishes to speak on this
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
bill uh do we have a count for but there
 
03:22:33.070 --> 03:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
were five people online u in in support
 
03:22:36.150 --> 03:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill all support all support no
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
opposition and on the blue sheet we have
 
03:22:42.389 --> 03:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
one person in
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
support with that I'm going to close out
 
03:22:50.950 --> 03:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:54.590 --> 03:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
545 so
 
03:22:58.150 --> 03:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh I guess we can talk about executing
 
03:23:00.670 --> 03:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and um the bill that we heard
 
03:23:02.830 --> 03:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
prior SB
 
03:23:06.510 --> 03:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
385 and
 
03:23:09.670 --> 03:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess we could we should do s SP
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
545 first and I believe that um
 
03:23:17.070 --> 03:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has an amendment
 
03:23:21.710 --> 03:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
to that bill which increases the uh size
 
03:23:25.189 --> 03:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
of this study committee by one
 
03:23:29.950 --> 03:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
person so that um in a situation where
 
03:23:32.269 --> 03:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
they need a quorum of
 
03:23:35.229 --> 03:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
three they will have four people on the
 
03:23:37.229 --> 03:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
committee instead of three so' already
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:44.950 --> 03:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
amendment he mentioned it well he he put
 
03:23:48.469 --> 03:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
He has yeah he he already drafted that
 
03:23:49.950 --> 03:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
with um
 
03:23:54.309 --> 03:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
OS and so um I would like to open up the
 
03:23:56.950 --> 03:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
exact session for S SP 545 if that's
 
03:24:00.910 --> 03:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay with everybody yeah and uh
 
03:24:03.189 --> 03:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I believe has a a
 
03:24:07.830 --> 03:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
motion yes so uh I'd like to uh on a
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
motion of OTP I'd like to offer the uh
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
following Amendment um Amendment s uh
 
03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
following Amendment um Amendment s uh
202

03:24:17.510 --> 03:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
202
 
03:24:22.870 --> 03:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
4-1 1492 H we want to adopt that right y
 
03:24:25.550 --> 03:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
yes adopt amend
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
and representative kraton seconds okay
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
and may I speak I second you may speak
 
03:24:34.110 --> 03:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
to the amendment okay so um as as I
 
03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
alluded to in during testimony um the
 
03:24:41.309 --> 03:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
bill as it as it came to us had uh two
 
03:24:43.550 --> 03:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
house members and one Senate member and
 
03:24:46.750 --> 03:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
a quorum of three uh experienced in the
 
03:24:49.630 --> 03:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
past has been that it is not uncommon
 
03:24:52.030 --> 03:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
for not all of the members of a study
 
03:24:54.229 --> 03:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
committee to make it on every
 
03:24:57.469 --> 03:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
occasion uh so uh I thought that it
 
03:25:00.910 --> 03:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
would be prudent to add one more um
 
03:25:02.750 --> 03:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
member to the committee from the House
 
03:25:02.760 --> 03:25:03.670 align:start position:0%
member to the committee from the House
of

03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh and in consultant in
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
consultation with our chair uh we
 
03:25:11.870 --> 03:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
decided that it would make sense to make
 
03:25:16.830 --> 03:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
that uh that second new member of it uh
 
03:25:19.349 --> 03:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
a member of our committee so we'll so
 
03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment has two members from uh
 
03:25:26.710 --> 03:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
Ena one member from uh uh envir um
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
executive departments Administration and
 
03:25:32.309 --> 03:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
one Senate member and that's what the
 
03:25:32.319 --> 03:25:33.510 align:start position:0%
one Senate member and that's what the
amendment

03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:25:36.429 --> 03:25:36.439 align:start position:0%

03:27:29.630 --> 03:27:29.640 align:start position:0%

03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%

Saturday the 4th it's 9:00 a.m. to 400
 
03:33:23.590 --> 03:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
p.m. okay all right one other thing I
 
03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
know that representative Bixby did you
 
03:33:29.269 --> 03:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
want to discuss this or in private or um
 
03:33:31.030 --> 03:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
I want to discuss it with you first oh
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
discuss it with me okay but I think um
 
03:33:38.429 --> 03:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
it's there's a little bit there's still
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit of
 
03:33:40.560 --> 03:33:42.389 align:start position:0%
a little bit of
um

03:33:42.389 --> 03:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:48.030 --> 03:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
uh disagreement about the and um so I
 
03:33:51.910 --> 03:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
think that we we might that um rather
 
03:33:56.229 --> 03:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
than it being um signed by the as a the
 
03:33:58.030 --> 03:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole that any members of
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
the committee you want to sign on it on
 
03:34:02.910 --> 03:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
to it uh would uh for the names to you
 
03:34:07.349 --> 03:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
and then those signatures go on
 
03:34:12.030 --> 03:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
as this letter was um being sent to them
 
03:34:21.429 --> 03:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.429 --> 03:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
um I I I didn't have an any um
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
expectation that everybody had a
 
03:34:30.870 --> 03:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
signature in in other words a physical
 
03:34:35.110 --> 03:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
signature on the letter it was just um
 
03:34:39.590 --> 03:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
written by me you know
 
03:34:44.349 --> 03:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
well it was going to be sent uh from me
 
03:34:48.150 --> 03:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
to our our uh Federal delegation um
 
03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
members and um I guess you know just
 
03:34:53.950 --> 03:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
writing on behalf of our committee based
 
03:34:57.389 --> 03:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
on the information of regarding that
 
03:34:57.399 --> 03:34:59.189 align:start position:0%
on the information of regarding that
bill

03:34:59.189 --> 03:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:34:59.199 --> 03:35:01.550 align:start position:0%
bill
1572

03:35:01.550 --> 03:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
1572
 
03:35:05.349 --> 03:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
so I think maybe maybe we should you and
 
03:35:07.590 --> 03:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
I should discuss and
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
then okay because I don't think that
 
03:35:12.670 --> 03:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to I think I don't know that
 
03:35:14.309 --> 03:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
full committee discussion is going to
 
03:35:18.590 --> 03:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
that I mean I could write it just from
 
03:35:24.269 --> 03:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
me and not from the entire committee
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's okay too
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
um okay so
 
03:35:32.070 --> 03:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
um let's you I
 
03:35:35.790 --> 03:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
discuss all right with that I'm going to
 
03:35:38.070 --> 03:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
adjourn our meeting for this afternoon
 
03:35:41.429 --> 03:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
and if I hear from any uh you know any
 
03:35:43.990 --> 03:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
further Senate bills I will schedule a
 
03:35:46.750 --> 03:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
meeting uh uh a further meeting in the
 
03:35:49.550 --> 03:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
future but as of this time we have no
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
other uh committee meeting scheduled uh
 
03:35:56.429 --> 03:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
to deal with any Senate bills um so
 
03:35:58.189 --> 03:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
we'll see our work could be finished
 
03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:04.269 --> 03:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
know representative smart do I need to
 
03:36:08.349 --> 03:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
use my microphone yeah sure okay do um
 
03:36:11.349 --> 03:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
how do we H who determines the committee
 
03:36:14.830 --> 03:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
for SB 545 and how do the
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
representatives no I mean so the uh the
 
03:36:23.309 --> 03:36:23.319 align:start position:0%
speaker if the bill gets passed through
 
03:36:25.830 --> 03:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
the house which it'll be on consent so
 
03:36:29.710 --> 03:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
my my guess is the Bill gets passed
 
03:36:31.710 --> 03:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
however uh the Senate would have to
 
03:36:34.950 --> 03:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
concur with it which I'm sure they will
 
03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
and then the governor would have to sign
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
it if it gets signed into law then what
 
03:36:41.189 --> 03:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
happens is uh the speaker of the house
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
would assign uh the people to be on this
 
03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:46.670 align:start position:0%
would assign uh the people to be on this
committee

03:36:46.670 --> 03:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:36:50.269 --> 03:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
um what the speaker has requested when
 
03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
we do these study committees now is that
 
03:36:52.239 --> 03:36:53.229 align:start position:0%
we do these study committees now is that
we

03:36:53.229 --> 03:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:36:55.309 --> 03:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
recommend uh individuals from our
 
03:36:58.229 --> 03:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
committee to be considered for
 
03:37:00.349 --> 03:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
membership of the sub of the study
 
03:37:06.389 --> 03:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
committee and normally uh the person who
 
03:37:10.229 --> 03:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
um who uh introduced or proposed the
 
03:37:13.150 --> 03:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
bill would Al I would imagine Senator
 
03:37:16.429 --> 03:37:16.439 align:start position:0%
prenis pennis would be chosen to be uh
 
03:37:18.750 --> 03:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate member on the committee so
 
03:37:21.870 --> 03:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.110 --> 03:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.349 --> 03:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.359 --> 03:37:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:51.070 --> 03:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
down representative Bixby yeah just a
 
03:37:54.870 --> 03:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
little more clarification on that
 
03:37:58.590 --> 03:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
process so um did I get it wrong uh you
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
didn't you covered most of the ground
 
03:38:04.030 --> 03:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
but it's a because it's a Senate Bill
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate member will be the convening
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
member yes um and then which is NI um
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
and because we specify which committees
 
03:38:18.670 --> 03:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
uh people will come come from it is uh
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
the the speaker will have to choose two
 
03:38:22.630 --> 03:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
people from our committee and one from
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
Edna and uh typically what happens is
 
03:38:31.950 --> 03:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
that um the chair uh will um we'll make
 
03:38:33.630 --> 03:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
the we'll make recommendations to the
 
03:38:36.590 --> 03:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
speaker and then the speaker will um
 
03:38:38.590 --> 03:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
listen to the chair's recommendations
 
03:38:40.429 --> 03:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
that doesn't always happen but it it
 
03:38:42.670 --> 03:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
usually happens so so that that's the
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
basic process so when you say the chair
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about Judy Judy yeah the the
 
03:38:50.030 --> 03:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee will make the
 
03:38:51.910 --> 03:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations for two members from
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
this committee and uh so anybody so once
 
03:38:59.229 --> 03:38:59.239 align:start position:0%
it once the governor signs it um Judy
 
03:39:03.630 --> 03:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
will probably send out a email saying uh
 
03:39:05.710 --> 03:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
is anybody interested and if you're
 
03:39:09.429 --> 03:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
interested then maybe I'll ask today who
 
03:39:12.429 --> 03:39:12.439 align:start position:0%
your who's who's
 
03:39:17.070 --> 03:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:18.349 --> 03:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
you get two
 
03:39:22.469 --> 03:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
people you are V right get two vets but
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
smart Kenny and then I think Alison is
 
03:39:34.229 --> 03:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:38.349 --> 03:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
Alison okay that's good to know so all
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
right um yeah so that that probably okay
 
03:39:44.910 --> 03:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
so um and then someone from Edna who can
 
03:39:48.030 --> 03:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
talk about lure yeah and then the oh the
 
03:39:49.389 --> 03:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
other thing I was going to mention is
 
03:39:52.030 --> 03:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
that uh depending on when the governor
 
03:39:55.030 --> 03:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
signs it it actually is conceivable that
 
03:39:58.389 --> 03:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
it could happen uh that it could be uh
 
03:40:02.229 --> 03:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
start earlier than in the fall uh if the
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
Senate member chooses to um to convene
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
before then for an organization meeting
 
03:40:13.070 --> 03:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
right uh no actually not in July no it
 
03:40:15.189 --> 03:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be after August I believe
 
03:40:15.199 --> 03:40:15.830 align:start position:0%
would have to be after August I believe
well

03:40:15.830 --> 03:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
no or before like June 10th yeah so it
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
could be it can be so basically July is
 
03:40:25.710 --> 03:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much blacked out and August is
 
03:40:27.229 --> 03:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
mostly blacked out from doing
 
03:40:29.950 --> 03:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
legislative business so it could start
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
before either in June or then we start
 
03:40:43.590 --> 03:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:50.910 --> 03:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
um on another
 
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
subject just before we we leave all
 
03:40:58.229 --> 03:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
leave um I want
 
03:41:00.950 --> 03:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
to I want to check on something here
 
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
because um we had a a
 
03:41:09.429 --> 03:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
um Homestead food bill to Homestead food
 
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
bills in our
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
committee and um one of them was we
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
changed the language so that it would
 
03:41:21.469 --> 03:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
expand the offerings of um uh of foods
 
03:41:23.309 --> 03:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
that could be sold at Homestead food
 
03:41:26.149 --> 03:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
stands to be pickles salsa relishes
 
03:41:30.429 --> 03:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
remember that um and that bill is going
 
03:41:34.510 --> 03:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
to be heard um this Thursday in the
 
03:41:34.520 --> 03:41:36.189 align:start position:0%
to be heard um this Thursday in the
Senate

03:41:36.189 --> 03:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
03:41:39.750 --> 03:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
um with that being said I know that we
 
03:41:42.750 --> 03:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
had discussed about having establishing
 
03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
a food safety subcommittee
 
03:41:50.030 --> 03:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
and I have names down here to be on that
 
03:41:53.070 --> 03:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as myself representative
 
03:41:55.670 --> 03:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
bxby representative kulan representative
 
03:41:58.510 --> 03:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
ktoa representative sofikitis and
 
03:41:58.520 --> 03:42:00.070 align:start position:0%
ktoa representative sofikitis and
representative

03:42:00.070 --> 03:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:06.550 --> 03:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
Murray and um I would imagine we would
 
03:42:09.429 --> 03:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how soon we could get
 
03:42:12.149 --> 03:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
together and have meetings to discuss
 
03:42:16.429 --> 03:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
with uh D DHHS Food Safety Division
 
03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
that's Colleen Smith and Abigail Rogers
 
03:42:22.550 --> 03:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh talking to talk to them about the
 
03:42:26.710 --> 03:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
possibilities of um further expansion of
 
03:42:31.550 --> 03:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
the um Homestead food safety legislation
 
03:42:34.429 --> 03:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
rsas to at least look at them because I
 
03:42:37.710 --> 03:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
know um people have dis have uh come to
 
03:42:41.910 --> 03:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
us in various forms to say that uh the
 
03:42:45.830 --> 03:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
food uh lure laws are confused
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
and uh would like to have us take a look
 
03:42:51.189 --> 03:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
at that and see where we can make some
 
03:42:53.389 --> 03:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
clarifications where we might be able to
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
make some expansions and make some
 
03:42:58.309 --> 03:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
changes in those rsas so that's what
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee would would be engaged
 
03:43:04.110 --> 03:43:04.120 align:start position:0%
in doing representative Bixby now I
 
03:43:07.070 --> 03:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
believe that we uh voted that the second
 
03:43:10.110 --> 03:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
of those bills um interim study right
 
03:43:12.149 --> 03:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
and so this subcommittee would be
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
looking at that looking at that and uh
 
03:43:17.630 --> 03:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
typically so we
 
03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
can uh start working on uh interim study
 
03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
bills before the fall ju uh but we can't
 
03:43:27.550 --> 03:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
do it in July or August but we can start
 
03:43:29.750 --> 03:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
we could do it in May or June if the
 
03:43:32.790 --> 03:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
speaker lets us right uh and that is
 
03:43:36.389 --> 03:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
often a matter of uh whether the speaker
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
perceives the resources such as this
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
room and us as being uh otherwise
 
03:43:45.149 --> 03:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
constrained or whether we would be a
 
03:43:46.830 --> 03:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
whether this room will be free and
 
03:43:48.750 --> 03:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
whether the members of the subcommittee
 
03:43:51.469 --> 03:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
would be free um it my guess is that the
 
03:43:53.149 --> 03:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee would be
 
03:43:59.710 --> 03:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
free uh and I don't it's so um unless
 
03:44:01.710 --> 03:44:01.720 align:start position:0%
there's some conflict with Committees of
 
03:44:04.349 --> 03:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
conference using this room I I think
 
03:44:07.710 --> 03:44:07.720 align:start position:0%
that it would be feasible to to uh to
 
03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
start working on it before summer and it
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
might be nice to get that sort of off
 
03:44:15.670 --> 03:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know off the table off the table
 
03:44:18.469 --> 03:44:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh but we can't do it unless the speaker
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
lets us exactly so that's your job yeah
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
no I'll I'll speak to I will speak to um
 
03:44:26.429 --> 03:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
speaker Packard about it and see how
 
03:44:28.590 --> 03:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
soon that we can get started either on
 
03:44:30.309 --> 03:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
that interim study or at least looking
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
at um those statutes so yeah we'll we'll
 
03:44:36.950 --> 03:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
take care of that all right well thank
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
you everybody appreciate it and um if I
 
03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
don't see you have a nice
 
03:44:46.309 --> 03:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
summer all right but
 
03:44:48.269 --> 03:44:48.279 align:start position:0%
we'll all we'll see everybody on the
 
03:44:49.870 --> 03:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
third yeah
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely for for our garbage tour yeah
