00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to get started here in a
 
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:32.570 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to get started here in a
second

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.130 align:start position:0%
 
much

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
okay it being two o'clock uh we're gonna
 
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead and get started with the work
 
00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
session on division three on finance we
 
00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
have uh four bills to uh listen to the
 
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh the public and to discuss a little
 
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
bit uh there is an order that was
 
00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 align:start position:0%
suggested in the calendar with the
 
00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
permission of Representative nordgren
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like to change up the sequence uh
 
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
they're all scheduled for two anyways
 
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just change this sequence
 
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
based on who we've got here who are
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak like for example first
 
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
up is 6 14 and representative rung is
 
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
here from Merrimack
 
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 align:start position:0%

um I've served on the HB 737 commission
 
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
for the past four years and for the last
 
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
two of those I've been uh chairman up

until December and one of the things
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
this commission does is we are charged
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
with looking at the health and
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of pfas
 
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
contamination stemming from the senko
 
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.950 align:start position:0%
contamination stemming from the senko

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
Bain
 
00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 align:start position:0%
operations in Merrimack and one every
 
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
year we submit an annual report to the
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
governor the Senate President the
 
00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and and a few other
 
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
folks with our legislative and
 
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
non-legislative recommendations and this
 
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
past year when we submitted our report
 
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
in November one of those recommendations
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
was to conduct a a cancer registry for
 
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
cancer that has been demonstrated to be
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
linked to pfas Expo closure
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
and after discussions with
 
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.409 align:start position:0%
and after discussions with
DHHS

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 align:start position:0%
DHHS
 
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
we introduced this bill to as a
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
feasibility study because what occurred
 
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
a little over a year ago is
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
dhh DHHS had conducted a cancer study a
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
cancer incident study and they
 
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
discovered that Merrimack has a
 
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
significantly higher rate of renal
 
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
cancer kidney cancer than what would be
 
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
expected and there's a four-phase
 
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
approach to analyzing these types of
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
diseases and linkages and we've
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
completed phase one and two but this
 
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
expenditure 500 000 would allow DHHS to
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
go into the next phase phase three which
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
is a feasibility study and
 
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative why I remember your
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
comments on Friday when I introduced to
 
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
12 about the importance of having these
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
types of studies to really understand
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
the causation of pfas contamination on
 
00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 align:start position:0%
human health and so this is
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
the result of that this is what happens
 
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
next so I implore you to
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
um support the funding for this bill not
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
only will it provide information to the
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
town of Merrimack and our residents but
 
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
also to other communities that have
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
suffered from pfas exposure
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
um just the ones in our area include
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
Bedford Litchfield and Londonderry but
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
there's also significant exposure in the
 
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 align:start position:0%
Seacoast area from the peas trade Port
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
so information from this phase three
 
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
study can be leveraged to so many other
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
areas not just for more understanding
 
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
about the impact of pfax exposure on
 
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
human health but also just going through
 
00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 align:start position:0%
that academic process can enable us to
 
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
DHS to be better equipped to understand
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
other environmentally triggered diseases
 
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to be joined today by
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
Michelle Roberge who's the division
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
director division Chief at for public
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
health at DHHS and also Ms Abby Rogers
 
00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
who is the legislative liaison she's
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with us she's also
 
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
worked with representative Leon from
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
Derry who worked on an amendment to this
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
bill which allows DHS to pursue grants
 
00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:40.099 align:start position:0%
to precede any
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
appropriation by the by the legislature
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
so if you don't mind Mr chairman if
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
there's any questions they would
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
probably be better able to answer them
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
from a financial process point of view I
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that but before we let you
 
00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
go is there anyone here that wants to
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
ask representative a question go
 
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.770 align:start position:0%
ask representative a question go
ahead

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
all right thanks representative wrong
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question and this
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
could wait if this if you don't know the
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
answer to this question is when I read
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
that it's limited to kidney cancer I was
 
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
curious as to why it wasn't going it's
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
not expanded to other cancers is that
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
limiting it at all I'm just was
 
00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:22.979 align:start position:0%
wondering why it's just kidney well uh
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative the kidney cancer renal
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
cancer which would be bundled in with
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
that is what was demonstrated from the
 
00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:33.659 align:start position:0%
phase two study that it was
 
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
significantly higher and so the focus of
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
the feasibility study would be on that
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
cancer the other cancers although some
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
kind of approached a level that would
 
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
require further study they didn't
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
um but kidney cancer did but I'm sure
 
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
someone from DHS may be able to give a
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
better a more specific response to that
 
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
you ever follow-up all right so you're
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
welcome to stay there while the other
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
two come forward or you can set back
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
whatever you want I'll step back a
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative erf thank you thank you
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
to my question uh two things how long
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
will it take and can you describe what a
 
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.060 align:start position:0%
phase three study is
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
with all due respect representative I
 
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that question
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
but I think the folks from DHHS could
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
very very good thanks okay thank you
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
folks from the Department want to come
 
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:49.790 align:start position:0%
folks from the Department want to come
up

so we'll start with introductions so
 
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.060 align:start position:0%

00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Dr Kathleen Bush I'm the sex and
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
chief of environmental Public Health
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
tracking within the division of Public
 
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
Health Services
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
but I I have probably five or six
 
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll defer if anyone has
 
00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:38.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.769 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
so for this study the biggest
 
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
expenditure by far is the I.T spend
 
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
portion of it is that correct the
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
information technology go ahead
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I believe that that might be the
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
physical note was updated
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
um so it doesn't have an I.T component
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
anymore it it's the appropriation is for
 
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars and it
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
would be for a contract that the
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
I was given
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
several amendments on oh wait a second
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
one Amendment on 565 we're on 614.
 
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
there we go I'm getting better at this
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay so it's now a half a million
 
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.810 align:start position:0%
okay so it's now a half a million
dollars

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:29.820 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
is for one contracted full-time
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
statistical research analyst one
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
Community engagement specialist
 
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380 align:start position:0%
and then Community engagement activities
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
along with some miscellaneous equipment
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
and indirect costs is that right is that
 
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
you're understanding what you what you
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
need yes that's correct and I think uh
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
represent tolerski hit the nail on the
 
00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:56.779 align:start position:0%
head already asking about
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
the extent to which we want to study
 
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
more I think the legislature is just
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
generally concerned about water quality
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
in the Merrimack area and all the health
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
risks that we believe is non-scientists
 
00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:14.459 align:start position:0%
even could stem from that and and so if
 
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to go forward and and and
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
really pay attention is this program
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
so the department
 
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:30.650 align:start position:0%
so the department
of

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
take a crack at this and then I'm sure
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
my colleagues can fill in around me
 
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
around the information that I provide
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
today so as representative rung noted in
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
her testimony that the department has
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
been has an ongoing investigation in the
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
Merrimack area for kidney cancer
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
incidents an increase in kidney cancer
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
incidents in that area and we are using
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
our protocol so New Hampshire has a
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
cancer concern investigation protocol
 
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
and she mentioned various phases in that
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
protocol so we have gone through phases
 
00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:08.459 align:start position:0%
one and two and based on the analysis
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
that we have done and and the results of
 
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
that that indicate that the increase in
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer incidence is we recommend
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
going to phase three and that phase
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
three if you look at our protocol is a
 
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:25.019 align:start position:0%
feasibility study and really what that
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
is is it's Gathering it's it's gathering
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
in information and doing an analysis to
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not the risk
 
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220 align:start position:0%
factors are there to go into what would
 
00:13:37.569 --> 00:13:37.579 align:start position:0%
be called a phase four or a full
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
epidemiological study of of uh you know
 
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:45.380 align:start position:0%
the the kidney cancer and the potential
 
00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
exposures to the area so we're kind of
 
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
in that in between you know not ready to
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
go do a full phase for study but looking
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
at the next step would be which would be
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
phase three a feasibility study
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
so this is coming by way of of the
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
policy committee and maybe this would
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
have been a good representative wrong
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
question do what what what was the
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
policy committee's position on this was
 
00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
this unanimous close to unanimous were
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
there what were the big issues left
 
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:23.150 align:start position:0%
there what were the big issues left
outstanding

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
Health Human Service and elderly Affairs
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee and I believe it was a 19-1 or
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
eight it was
 
00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:33.660 align:start position:0%
oh 19-0 as amended
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and it uh went uh it
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
passed the Full House on the consent
 
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.310 align:start position:0%
passed the Full House on the consent
calendar

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hole
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman so you're speaking of
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
phase three and phase four for those who
 
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
are not familiar with your protocols
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
um can you just briefly describe phase
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
one phase two right as it feeds into the
 
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.829 align:start position:0%
one phase two right as it feeds into the
system

00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:14:57.839 --> 00:15:00.829 align:start position:0%
system
foreign

00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
so phase one is um usually just when we
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
receive a sort of request or concern
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
from the community or from a legislative
 
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.490 align:start position:0%
from the community or from a legislative
committee

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
um that's where we just collect
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
information about what the concern is
 
00:15:14.399 --> 00:15:15.650 align:start position:0%
information about what the concern is
and

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
um kind of just do a first pass at
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
whether there's anything plausible to
 
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:21.380 align:start position:0%
look into
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
phase two is if we determine there is
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
something and just as an example phase
 
00:15:28.689 --> 00:15:28.699 align:start position:0%
one a lot of times
 
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:31.620 align:start position:0%
my staff will receive phone call like a
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
phone call from a Community member
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
saying I'm seeing lots of different
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
cancers among you know people living on
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
my street and we've all lived here for
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know decades and this is really
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
concerning and at that point we would
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
potentially gather information about
 
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:49.139 align:start position:0%
what types of cancers they are seeing in
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
their neighbors and a lot of times this
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
is very common you know you might have
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
breast cancer colorectal cancer
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
prostate cancer and at that point we
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
might just do some education around that
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
the those are all really different types
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
of cancers with different types of risk
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
factors they're screening amenable and
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
they're age related so most I'd say 97
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
of concerns end at that point
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
with just basic education sometimes and
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
an example that has come up in the last
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
couple of years you might get a phone
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
call from somebody who's working at a
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
school and they feel like they're seeing
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of cases of breast cancer
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
among the teachers that have been
 
00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
working there and for example they're
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
seeing them in 30 year olds and so that
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
kind of checks off a couple of the boxes
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
for us where we say well 30 is a little
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
bit you know early to be seeing cases of
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
breast cancer and oh it's in you know it
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
is one type of cancer as opposed to
 
00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
several different ones so in phase two
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
so if we saw that kind of a pattern we'd
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
go to phase two which is where we look
 
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
at our cancer registry data and analyze
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
and maybe look at things like breast
 
00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
cancer rates in a community so that's
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
what we had done in Merrimack which is
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
what identified the higher than expected
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
number of kidney Cancers and then phase
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
three is really part of the challenge
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
for us is that our cancer registry does
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
not collect a lot of additional
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
information about individuals who are
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with cancer so we don't get
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
things like the history of where a
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
person has lived for their entire life
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
all we have is their address at the
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
point when they're diagnosed with a
 
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.710 align:start position:0%
point when they're diagnosed with a
cancer

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
we also don't get information as as
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
surprising as it might be we don't
 
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
capture things like smoking history or
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
other known risk factors for certain
 
00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:43.669 align:start position:0%
other known risk factors for certain
cancers

00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
cancers
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
so when we have a situation like we have
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
um we have to actually gather additional
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
information from people to even get a
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
sense of is there some sort of a
 
00:17:57.289 --> 00:17:57.299 align:start position:0%
hypothesis we could make so for example
 
00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460 align:start position:0%
in Merrimack without knowing people's
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
residential history you could actually
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people that were diagnosed
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
with kidney cancer a month after they
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
moved there that's probably not likely
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
but that's part of what the feasibility
 
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:12.780 align:start position:0%
study is going to try and gather
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
information to suss out and then do you
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
want phase four and then phase four
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
would be a really sort of bigger
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
undertaking we call it an
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
epidemiological study it's probably what
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
people are most familiar with in terms
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
of how things are researched and tested
 
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
and could include something like a case
 
00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559 align:start position:0%
control study where you really compare
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
exposures between people who have that
 
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
Health outcome of kidney cancer and
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
those who don't
 
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
that was very helpful so if you proceed
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
from a phase three to a phase four is
 
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:48.539 align:start position:0%
there a time where you start looking at
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
residents of other towns who did reside
 
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.090 align:start position:0%
residents of other towns who did reside
in

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
um Merrimack who now live in Bosco in or
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere else right up in the Lakes
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
Region so how do you do you then look at
 
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:02.780 align:start position:0%
data from where people move
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
I would say even in phase three
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
um one of the first steps for that phase
 
00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:09.419 align:start position:0%
is to create what we call a case
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
definition and in that case definition
 
00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
we would even start to look at probably
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
people who had lived in Merrimack for
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
some period of time and may have moved
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
and then been diagnosed with kidney
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
cancer and we have a national network of
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
cancer Registries so we can reach out to
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
partner States and try and you know
 
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
identify who those individuals are
 
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
where would I find the results of phase
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
one and phase two are they online
 
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:42.529 align:start position:0%
one and phase two are they online
somewhere

00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
in the HHS site yes you would find the
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
results on the department's website
 
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.310 align:start position:0%
results on the department's website
um

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly where on the cancer
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
program web page cancer program website
 
00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:55.700 align:start position:0%
further question
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
are you going to do
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
wide-ranging amongst the population to
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
see blood tests see if other people
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
will you be able to determine from blood
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
tests the amount of of pfas within blood
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
streams in a representative group is
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
so I think the the first step was if we
 
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
if this bill moves forward when we get
 
00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:21.539 align:start position:0%
the appropriation is we would want to
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
establish a contract with a research
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
organization as as Whitney noted to
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
start to begin to design what the study
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
will look like what exactly is going to
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
be included in the study we do know that
 
00:20:36.169 --> 00:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
it will be uh you know working with the
 
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
community and impacted individuals there
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
will be a need for recruitment to
 
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
determine to say right here and now I
 
00:20:45.049 --> 00:20:45.059 align:start position:0%
don't know that we could specifically
 
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
say exactly what will be involved in the
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
study but at a minimum we would want to
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
be doing recruitment with impacted
 
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:54.980 align:start position:0%
individuals working with
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
impacted the impacted Community to
 
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
determine you know as as uh Miss Hammond
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
noted it to determine
 
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700 align:start position:0%
how long have the people been in those
 
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
areas have they actually been exposed to
 
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
pfas you know what what is their
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
drinking water have they can you know
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
sort of that risk picture what is the
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
risk picture for the individuals that we
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
know of so we can't answer that today to
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
say that there would be blood testing or
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
I think we'd want to work with our um
 
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
our research organization to figure out
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
what exactly does this study look like I
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
am also interested in another exposed
 
00:21:36.169 --> 00:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
group firemen who are spraying this
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
stuff out of the hoses and perhaps
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
getting a study going on them if you
 
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
could find out from whoever contracts
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
with you if that's possible something
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
that and it would probably do it
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide representative samples and
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
people that have been a fireman for at
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
least 10 years and have some exposure to
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
this I wonder what how much further we
 
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
could go in in doing something like that
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
so we see Statewide what the exposure
 
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to National initiatives
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
but certainly just like we would explore
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
residential history we would also be
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
gathering information on occupational
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
history and what people have done for
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
work over time to explore Trends in
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
occupation and I think all of that then
 
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
feeds together into a potential you know
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
phase four study and building I do think
 
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
this was producing a foundation for
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
future work
 
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Moon
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you all for being
 
00:22:39.169 --> 00:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
here and for all the work you've done to
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
this point on this very serious issue my
 
00:22:45.649 --> 00:22:45.659 align:start position:0%
question is how often is it that a phase
 
00:22:45.659 --> 00:22:47.210 align:start position:0%
question is how often is it that a phase
two

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
would become a phase three and the
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
purpose for the question is to highlight
 
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
the severity of this circumstance in my
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
community and the surrounding area thank
 
00:22:58.679 --> 00:23:00.350 align:start position:0%
community and the surrounding area thank
you

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
so I can tell you I've been in my this
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
position for the last decade
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
um we probably receive
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't 40 40 inquiries you know a
 
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.510 align:start position:0%
um I don't 40 40 inquiries you know a
year

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
um probably like I said around 90
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
percent of those go are just phase one
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
we provide education maybe 10 of those
 
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
go go on to phase two where we use our
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
data and actually calculate you know
 
00:23:29.529 --> 00:23:29.539 align:start position:0%
look at different things
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then it has only this would be the
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
second time in 10 years that we had come
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
to the conclusion based on our analysis
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
and sort of you know plausibility and
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
Community concerns that this should go
 
00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that representative
 
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
Leon put together this amendment and
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
she's very thorough but I just I want I
 
00:23:59.169 --> 00:23:59.179 align:start position:0%
just want to check the logic on this
 
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.140 align:start position:0%
because immediately you want to begin
 
00:24:06.649 --> 00:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
with two very different types of
 
00:24:06.659 --> 00:24:08.690 align:start position:0%
with two very different types of
employees

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
um and I it just makes me wonder should
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
should one come before the other or
 
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
should they actually be on Parallel
 
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
tracks and then the beyond that is are
 
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
these redundant with other things we're
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
doing in the department to where we
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
don't need a dedicated full-time person
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
but we do need a Time slice of somebody
 
00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
so so we've got somebody who's expert at
 
00:24:36.169 --> 00:24:36.179 align:start position:0%
statistical research we've got community
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
engagement I understand why you would
 
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
need to have both I'm just curious if
 
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
one really logically precedes the other
 
00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:48.020 align:start position:0%
in a project plan and if we really need
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
manpower to fully fund both of them as
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
full-time employees
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm happy to start start to answer
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
that question so
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
um currently right now the way the
 
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
appropriation sort of that we're
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
envisioning the use of the appropriation
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be to contract with
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
um an organization like a research or an
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
academic organization because we just
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the
 
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.370 align:start position:0%
don't have the
um

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:15.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
technical expertise or the existing
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
resources to be able to put time the
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
time needed towards this project so the
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
first you are right that it's two
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
positions one is a full-time would be a
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
full-time research analyst position that
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
would be sort of the lead of this
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
project the second position is actually
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
a part-time position it would be the
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
community engagement specialist because
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
this work is so because Community
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
engagement is so critical that both of
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
these positions are really necessary you
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
know the the Project Lead the the lead
 
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
analyst would be you know responsible
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
for leading the project conducting a
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
scientific literature review developing
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
the study design study implementation
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
data analysis analysis and things like
 
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.140 align:start position:0%
that the community engagement specialist
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
would be really working with impacted
 
00:26:08.529 --> 00:26:08.539 align:start position:0%
individuals families communities
 
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
we follow a national guidance from CDC
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
Centers for Disease Control on how to
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
conduct a cancer concern investigation
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
which really stresses the need for
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
Community engagement and working with
 
00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:27.299 align:start position:0%
local officials and you know policy
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
makers so we would this would be a very
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
transparent process and and I will say
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
that in order for this to be successful
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
study recruitment so we really need
 
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
people impacted people people that have
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer that live in the area or
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
have lived in the area to agree to
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
participate in the study because without
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
that study recruitment we wouldn't have
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
any information we wouldn't discern any
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
information from the phase three study
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
so it's super critical that we have that
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
Community engagement person to really
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
work with the community to build trust
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
within the community and and recruit for
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
the study
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that I'm I'm about to
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
let you go if there are no other
 
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.390 align:start position:0%
let you go if there are no other
questions

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
do you have a question still I do thank
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
you all right if I pulled up the report
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for telling us where it was I
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
see why you guys focused on kidney and
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
renal pelvis right based on the numbers
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
in the prior report my question is
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
regarding two other areas looking at
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that same data column and rectum start
 
00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:34.220 align:start position:0%
with writing an sir 1.2 going up to 1.43
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
and there was one other
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
similar in nature right urinary bladder
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
seen similar numbers where right the
 
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
entire the entire spectrum is north of
 
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
one is there a reason those were
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
excluded I mean I understand the kidney
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
side I get that that's easy from the
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
data the engineering me loves looking at
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
this but there's two others that seem to
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
crop up as well why would they not be
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
included if you're doing this research
 
00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
so I I can't recall the specific numbers
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
in the chart but you probably have them
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
in front of you the the key difference
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
for kidney cancer versus those other two
 
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
types of cancer that you referenced are
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
related to the confidence intervals so
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
when we look at what's called the
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
standardized incidence ratio we look at
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
whether it's one or greater than one so
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
you picked out like colorectal was 1.2
 
00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
we also look at the confidence intervals
 
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
and if the lower confidence interval is
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
above one then we would it's the ones I
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
picked out yeah oh uh there shouldn't be
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
any other cancer types that are above so
 
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
colon was one to 1.43 so if it's urinary
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
bladder was 0.98 to 1.49 so so not above
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
not one technically above but on the
 
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
very edge and vastly different than the
 
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
others in that same list of cancers
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for that as epidemiologist I
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
um I would just add that based on the
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
evolving scientific literature of what
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
we know between exposure and outcomes
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
the literature really suggests a strong
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence of a link to kidney
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
cancer where the others are really still
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
emerging and I think this gets back to
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
representative tellerski's question
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
around other outcomes part of the study
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
will also investigate co-occurring
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes so we'll look at risk factors
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
and the co-occurrence of some of these
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
things and again it will build a
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
foundation for future work for us to
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
better understand a range of Health
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
outcomes that may be related to
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
exposures that we're observing in this
 
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.169 align:start position:0%
exposures that we're observing in this
community

00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
do you have to follow up do you have one
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
represents Stringham yeah just um in in
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
terms of Contracting for this I assume
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to work through the
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
contracts group here when do you think
 
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh reasonably how long would it take for
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
you to go from uh laying out the project
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
to actually having the two contractors
 
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:00.539 --> 00:30:03.289 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
um I so I would give a range of two
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
months to six months depending on you
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
know who was identified as the vendor to
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
do the work we do have an existing
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
contract for cancer registry and we have
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
used that contract for similar types of
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
work so if we were to use an existing
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
contract it would like I said be two to
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
six months
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
um if if I were a Merrimack
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative I I would like you to
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
periodically touch base with me to let
 
00:30:36.889 --> 00:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
me know how we're doing from a community
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
perspective how big of a
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
sample size of the total population n
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
ought to be and how we're doing at the
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
community engagement level you know if
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're have if we're struggling with uh
 
00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
with just not doing well on the
 
00:30:54.649 --> 00:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
community engagement level I would I
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
would think people would want to know
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
that so although if we if we pass this
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
and give you the money there's nothing
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
in here that requires any periodic
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
reporting I would just recommend you
 
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:07.820 align:start position:0%
keep people informed
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely and just to let you know so
 
00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:12.059 align:start position:0%
there is an existing commission it's
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
it's called the HB 737 Commission in
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
Merrimack in particular and surrounding
 
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
communities but we are a member
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
DHHS sits on the commission and it meets
 
00:31:26.289 --> 00:31:26.299 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis so we would certainly
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
provide periodic updates probably on a
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
monthly basis to the commission and and
 
00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220 align:start position:0%
I believe most of the Merrimack or
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
several Merrimack Representatives sit on
 
00:31:39.409 --> 00:31:39.419 align:start position:0%
the commission as well
 
00:31:39.419 --> 00:31:40.850 align:start position:0%
the commission as well
okay

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm ready to do a last call here
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in the audience
 
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
that wants to speak on this particular
 
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.169 align:start position:0%
that wants to speak on this particular
bill

00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%

thank you for your time uh we're going
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
to move on to uh I believe 282 is next
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative Shapiro you're among
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
the people that are I'm anticipating
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
will want to speak
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
is is there is there anyone else here to
 
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
speak to 282 that I should know about be
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%

now
 
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
we'll do this
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:32:41.769 --> 00:32:41.779 align:start position:0%
committee members I'm Joe Shapiro
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
representing Cheshire 16 Keen
 
00:32:48.169 --> 00:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
um I assume that all of you or most of
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
you heard me speak on this bill in the
 
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:53.700 align:start position:0%
house and so I'll try to keep it brief
 
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.930 align:start position:0%
house and so I'll try to keep it brief
um

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
in 1996 there was a major welfare
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
welfare reform bill passed under
 
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
President Clinton and it included
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
creating waiting periods for certain
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
federal benefits so one of those waiting
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
periods was for certain classes of
 
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.009 align:start position:0%
periods was for certain classes of
immigrants

00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:15.019 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
in order to be eligible to apply for
 
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.769 align:start position:0%
in order to be eligible to apply for
Medicaid

00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
in 2009 the chip reauthorization
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
bill under the federal government
 
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
created an option for states to waive
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
that five-year waiting period for
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
certain groups of lawfully residing
 
00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.190 align:start position:0%
certain groups of lawfully residing
immigrants

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.930 align:start position:0%
immigrants
um

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
that states could take
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
amend their Medicaid State plan to
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
include that and as you'll see on the
 
00:33:51.009 --> 00:33:51.019 align:start position:0%
map that I sent around
 
00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:54.059 align:start position:0%
35 States for
 
00:33:54.059 --> 00:33:55.009 align:start position:0%
35 States for
um

00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:57.529 --> 00:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
for children in 37 States for pregnant
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
women have taken that option or created
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
some other kind of option for coverage
 
00:34:08.089 --> 00:34:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:09.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:09.839 --> 00:34:11.329 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good bill I think this
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
is something New Hampshire should have
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
for several reasons
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
um one is it's an investment in families
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
it's an investment in young children and
 
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
um pregnant women we can't always agree
 
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:29.290 align:start position:0%
um pregnant women we can't always agree
about

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:29.300 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
issues like abortion but I think we all
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
tend to agree that families should get
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
the help they need to get a good start
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
in life and this will take a select
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
group of people just children
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
and pregnant women
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
from immigrant families who are lawfully
 
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:50.060 align:start position:0%
residing in New Hampshire
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
and provide them with the opportunity to
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
apply for Medicaid if they're otherwise
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
eligible in other words if by income
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're eligible then they would not
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
have this five-year wait this bill would
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
waive the five-year wait
 
00:35:07.609 --> 00:35:07.619 align:start position:0%
I think the reasons that this is a good
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
bill and that we should proceed with
 
00:35:12.109 --> 00:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
this is that it's investment in the
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of children families
 
00:35:16.079 --> 00:35:19.069 align:start position:0%
health and wellness of children families
um

00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
we have a tremendous Workforce shortage
 
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and all around the
 
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:27.260 align:start position:0%
country really and I don't expect that
 
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579 align:start position:0%
immigrants coming to New Hampshire are
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to solve the workforce shortage
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
but I think they're uh an element of of
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
helping with that
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
um in researching this bill I spoke to
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
the vice president at pitco friellator
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
which I'd never heard of but evidently
 
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
they make friolaters for McDonald's all
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
over the world and they're located in
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
Concord and they have a large
 
00:35:59.569 --> 00:35:59.579 align:start position:0%
manufacturing Workforce and during covid
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
and since covid they've really been
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
hurting they can't find people to hire
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
people have left and so when I spoke to
 
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339 align:start position:0%
the vice president there he said that
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
someone had suggested to them that they
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
hire a few Afghan evacuees who were
 
00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:17.060 align:start position:0%
resettled in Concord so they hired four
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
afghan evacuees that had come to Concord
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
and they did such a good job that when I
 
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:24.980 align:start position:0%
spoke to this fellow
 
00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
in December he said they had hired 40
 
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.010 align:start position:0%
in December he said they had hired 40
Afghan

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.020 align:start position:0%
Afghan
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
evacuees and that they were looking to
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
figure out how they could create a
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
prayer room since most of these um
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
Afghans or Muslim and pray five times a
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
day so they were they were outfitting uh
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
a prayer room so that they could
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
um keep good relations with these
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
employers so once again I don't think
 
00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that's going to attract a
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
lot of people to immigrants to New
 
00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.450 align:start position:0%
lot of people to immigrants to New
Hampshire

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
um but at least we won't be hanging a
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
sign out saying that you're not welcome
 
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.190 align:start position:0%
sign out saying that you're not welcome
here

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.810 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
another reason that this is a good bill
 
00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
I think is that
 
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.290 align:start position:0%
I think is that
um

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
when people don't have health care
 
00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.589 align:start position:0%
when people don't have health care
insurance

00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:13.190 align:start position:0%
insurance
um

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
frequently people go without Health Care
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes they put off getting health
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
care until the problems are more serious
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
and they end up in the emergency room or
 
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
with um a bigger problems and I think
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
this bill will once again this is a
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
small Bill affecting very few people
 
00:37:34.569 --> 00:37:34.579 align:start position:0%
about 300 people
 
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
but this bill will help with
 
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
unreimbursed costs that now
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
um our health care providers just have
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
to eat or
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
um well I can say in Keen they I don't
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
think they think of it as just that
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're eating these costs they've come
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
forward and um want to encourage people
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
in our community to get health care and
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
they want to encourage the community to
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
be welcoming one for immigrants so um we
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
have a project in Keene that works with
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
Asylum Seekers and
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
um many of these people have been
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
getting health care but the but it's not
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
paid for
 
00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:18.290 align:start position:0%
paid for
um

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
so let me just say who would be
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
um who would be eligible for this
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
five-year weight being waived I sent
 
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.770 align:start position:0%
five-year weight being waived I sent
around

00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you I've researched this for
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
two years and it is so complicated and
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
so hard for me to understand and I found
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
this one woman in Los Angeles who works
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
for a national immigration law Center
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
who helps me to understand but I still
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
cannot say that I fully understand all
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
the different kind of categories we tend
 
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:51.140 align:start position:0%
to think of immigration as
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
binary either people are
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
documented or they're not documented but
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
when in reality it's not a binary system
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
there are all different Shades of Gray
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're all different they're all
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
different categories of people being
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
here with different rights and benefits
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
and the main group of people that would
 
00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
be covered through this
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
would be people who come through family
 
00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.490 align:start position:0%
would be people who come through family
unification

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:21.500 align:start position:0%
unification
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
and are either about to get their Green
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
Card who are or have just gotten their
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
green card
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
people who come through temporary
 
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
protected status which is um when there
 
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:35.300 align:start position:0%
has been some kind of major
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
environmental or war in a particular
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
country and people from that country are
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
given temporary protected status
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
another group that this would affect
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
um are people who are seeking Asylum so
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
if someone comes to this country
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
they pass an initial interview which is
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
called a credible fear interview and
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
then they're allowed to apply for
 
00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.670 align:start position:0%
then they're allowed to apply for
um Asylum

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
um Asylum
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
they're usually given a hearing a year
 
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes more off in the future
 
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.370 align:start position:0%
sometimes more off in the future
and

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
for those people when the children have
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
been here for 180 days they would fit in
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
this category they would be able to
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
apply for Medicaid if they otherwise
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
were eligible and for adults it would be
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
a halfway process halfway in the process
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
when they get a work a work permit
 
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:42.170 align:start position:0%
when they get a work a work permit
um

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
what else do I want to say um
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
I I'll say a couple of things about
 
00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.270 align:start position:0%
I I'll say a couple of things about
um

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'll say a couple of things about
 
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:54.290 align:start position:0%
I'll say a couple of things about
um

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:58.310 --> 00:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
the ability for us to adapt this bill
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
um but um Mr Lipman who's in the back
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
would be better able to answer these
 
00:41:02.339 --> 00:41:03.710 align:start position:0%
would be better able to answer these
questions

00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
um my understanding that this bill and
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
the bill that's going to come up
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
um next or one after that 565. these are
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
federal options so they're options it's
 
00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:17.339 align:start position:0%
not something that I thought of or
 
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:19.140 align:start position:0%
someone on our committee thought of
 
00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
these are federal options and it's kind
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
of like you take it or you don't take it
 
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.690 align:start position:0%
of like you take it or you don't take it
um

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
and in order to actually adapt it to New
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or adapt it to some other idea
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
that we might have which may be a good
 
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.970 align:start position:0%
that we might have which may be a good
idea

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
you can apply to do that but
 
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
um it involves a particular kind of
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
waiver that is very extent expensive to
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
pursue and to keep track of once you got
 
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
it probably more than the money you
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
would save so if we're looking for
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
I've been told by Mr lippman better to
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
put off the effective date than to try
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
to get a waiver to change the specifics
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
let's go on with testimony and then
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
we'll just take questions after go ahead
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Bob Dunn the director
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
of public policy for the Roman Catholic
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
Diocese of Manchester and I'm here today
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Bishop Peter labashi in
 
00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
support of both House Bill 282 and House
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 565 the postpartum bill that you're
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to hear next and I would to save
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
time I would say ditto
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
um and I would just say that the reason
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
that we think that these bills are
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
important are that they're pro-life
 
00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.589 align:start position:0%
important are that they're pro-life
bills

00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
um they enhance the quality of life they
 
00:42:59.089 --> 00:42:59.099 align:start position:0%
save lives potentially and so um we
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
think that uh it that they really should
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
happen it's a very limited number of
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
people as you've heard on both sides of
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
this and Mr lippman can speak about that
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
in more detail but um these are the
 
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
sorts of bills that we think enhance the
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
common good in human dignity and that's
 
00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
why we support them thank you
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative order no
 
00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:29.569 align:start position:0%
questions representative order no
anyone

00:43:29.569 --> 00:43:29.579 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:30.589 align:start position:0%
anyone
um

00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
I I just want to have an observation
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh I I I really appreciate your
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Shapiro
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
referring uh to the pregnant women and I
 
00:43:44.569 --> 00:43:44.579 align:start position:0%
think it's ridiculous that we have a
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
chart here that refers to pregnant
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
people I mean we we should follow the
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
science by now women get pregnant and
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
it's not even worth commenting on other
 
00:43:59.089 --> 00:43:59.099 align:start position:0%
than I I think on in defense of the
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
language and in defensive science we
 
00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
ought to just acknowledge reality so I I
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
would like to comment on that which is
 
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.309 align:start position:0%
would like to comment on that which is
that

00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
um that is a map that I got from a
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
National Organization that tracks these
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
things and if you notice my bill says
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
pregnant women it does not say pregnant
 
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
people and that's why thank you thank
 
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.730 align:start position:0%
people and that's why thank you thank
you

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
are there any other ques representative
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
Weiler yes what we have encountered in
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
the last several years is a huge
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
increase in monies being paid out to
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
Immigrant families coming here and
 
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
perhaps the reason for the delay in New
 
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is we could have a just
 
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099 align:start position:0%
someone fly in have a baby fly back out
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
and a few years later do this chain
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
migration bit with people that weren't
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
really concerned about getting a job as
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
much as they were concerned about
 
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:50.510 align:start position:0%
much as they were concerned about
getting

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
public benefits and that's been one of
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
the skyrocketing costs in our country
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
that we have to be aware of because it
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
soon becomes a burden that's
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
unaffordable if we have too many people
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
thinking we're a magnet for welfare so
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's not something we'd rush into thank
 
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.190 align:start position:0%
it's not something we'd rush into thank
you

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
can I can I comment on that
 
00:45:12.359 --> 00:45:14.510 align:start position:0%
can I can I comment on that
um

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.220 align:start position:0%
I I understand that immigration is a
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
terrible problem in our country and that
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's unsustainable what's happening in
 
00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:30.500 align:start position:0%
this country so many people being here
 
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.410 align:start position:0%
this country so many people being here
working

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:32.420 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.630 align:start position:0%
working
contributing

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.220 align:start position:0%
no way to be acknowledged no way to be
 
00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
um no way to have a path um towards
 
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
citizenship more people come in it's I I
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
would agree I'd be the first one to
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
agree with you that it's chaos it's
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
broken it's a real problem
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
um and so this bill in no way tries to
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
fix the problem it just
 
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.069 align:start position:0%
fix the problem it just
um

00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
it just takes what is and tries to
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
address one very very tiny
 
00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:07.700 align:start position:0%
um portion of it and in response to
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
people taking advantage of benefits
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
I I understand that argument we had a
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
person who couldn't come because her
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
um because she was working but we had
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
one person give testimony
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
um written testimony and someone read it
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
in our hearing she is a woman originally
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
from Africa
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
came with her husband and two children
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
and was pregnant and came to Texas
 
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.430 align:start position:0%
and was pregnant and came to Texas
initially

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
she um in Texas they have these benefits
 
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
so she was pregnant and she had Medicaid
 
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
and was going to deliver the baby in in
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
Texas her husband was detained at the
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
Stratford County Jail
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
and um so she moved her family here her
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
two young children and um
 
00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
and her pregnant self only to find that
 
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have not taken this
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
option she had no health care she was
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
about to deliver a baby she got some
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
community support and was fixed up with
 
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
um charity Health Care
 
00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.069 align:start position:0%
um charity Health Care
um

00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
currently when she wrote the letter
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
currently she's had a child her husband
 
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
is out of detention they've both now had
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
their hearing for Asylum and they've
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
both been granted Asylum she works she
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
has gotten her LNA she's working in a
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
nursing home and she's now in nursing
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
school to become a nurse so I understand
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
your concern that
 
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
people will be a burden and I'm not
 
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:44.339 align:start position:0%
saying that there aren't some people
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
that will be a burden but people are
 
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
also an enormous resource in terms of
 
00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:51.180 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we need in New
 
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.609 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we need in New
Hampshire

00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
I wonder how the husband ended up in
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
well I could I could answer you but um
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense it doesn't
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
make any sense
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
is that a rhetorical question just the
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
way it is so representative Minnie thank
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for being here I know
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
how dedicated you are to this subject
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
matter representative my question is
 
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
I've heard you several times now refer
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
to the five-year waiver I'm just trying
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
to piece that into this bill as I don't
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
see that language here is that a chipra
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
tie-in or how does that five-year waiver
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
if you could just briefly
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
describe that not a five-year waiver a
 
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
five-year wait so if you oh I'm sorry I
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
thought you said if you um
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
have this and I'm glad I asked me but
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
you have this CMS guidance this was
 
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
something that CMS sent out
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
um following the year following when the
 
00:48:52.609 --> 00:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
option was created and it explains it
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
all so currently many classes of
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
immigrants have to wait five years to be
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
eligible to apply for Medicaid even if
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
their income indicates that they are
 
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
eligible so if this option is taken if
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment is written to the State
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid plan
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
just for children and pregnant women who
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
are lawfully residing here who have some
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
kind of lawful immigration status that
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
five-year wait will be waived
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
representslersky thank you Mr chairman
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if um when we're
 
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.470 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if um when we're
discussing

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
people who are resettled here in New
 
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.550 align:start position:0%
people who are resettled here in New
Hampshire

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
do they actually have a choice are they
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
ever going to see a map and do research
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
and say I would like to go to Texas
 
00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:50.220 align:start position:0%
where pregnant women and children get
 
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
services or are they resettled here
 
00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:53.460 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
you know a governmental uh guidance of
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:01.540 align:start position:0%
so once again
 
00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
so once again
[Music]

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.050 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
when I said that um
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
immigration status is not binary it's
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
not one or the other there are many many
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
ways that people come to the country and
 
00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
I think maybe you're referring to people
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
who are resettled here through a
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
resettlement agency they're vetted in
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
some manner the people from Afghanistan
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
were not vetted as well because
 
00:50:27.119 --> 00:50:27.770 align:start position:0%
were not vetted as well because
um

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
it was an emergency obviously and it was
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
um totally chaotic but people who are
 
00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:36.200 align:start position:0%
resettled through the state department
 
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
like the Afghans or through a number of
 
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:43.740 align:start position:0%
people in the Concord area Laconia area
 
00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
and Manchester they're brought to a
 
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
specific place in place and set
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
resettled through an agency some of the
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
other groups people who are who are
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
looking for a green card they might have
 
00:50:58.809 --> 00:50:58.819 align:start position:0%
come to the area where their relatives
 
00:51:01.609 --> 00:51:01.619 align:start position:0%
live who were petitioning
 
00:51:01.619 --> 00:51:02.329 align:start position:0%
live who were petitioning
um

00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:02.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:04.849 align:start position:0%
people who are
um

00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
coming to request Asylum might have come
 
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
a different way so it really varies
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
depending on how people came and under
 
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
what auspices they came thank you I
 
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
guess my point was simply there are
 
00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:19.619 align:start position:0%
reasons why people are placed here and
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily go in search of a
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
certain benefit that would apply to one
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
person in their family I think that's
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
safe to say people are just trying to
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
survive thank you
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's probably a question for Mr Lipman
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
but how long does it take New Hampshire
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh good afternoon for the
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
record Henry Littman Medicaid director
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative it depends on the type of
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
wave we're talking about in this
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
instance we were talking about or in the
 
00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
instance representative was referring to
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
as an 11 15 waiver and those
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
um require an evaluation
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
um an independent evaluation that
 
00:52:26.569 --> 00:52:26.579 align:start position:0%
sometimes can run seven figures to be
 
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
able to to conduct because it has to be
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
done over multiple years and hiring
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
upside research firm it typically has
 
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
taken us six months on the short end to
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
get one of those in place there are
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
other types of waivers that are can be
 
00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:44.540 align:start position:0%
done typically in 90 to
 
00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:47.339 align:start position:0%
180 days
 
00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
an example would be some of the ones
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
related to the dental program that are
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
different types of waivers
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
a research waiver when you're asking for
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
an exception from the the policies as
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to asking for a waiver for an
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
established policy that's the difference
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
when you're asking for an exception from
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
an existing policy it takes longer than
 
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of a policy that's
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you so you would anticipate that
 
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
this would take probably up to six
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
months to get this waiver so this type
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
of waiver would be
 
00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:25.859 align:start position:0%
um is I think you're asking for a policy
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
outside of what is the established
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
policy which could take
 
00:53:30.359 --> 00:53:31.309 align:start position:0%
policy which could take
um probably

00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
um probably
 
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
nine six months to a year knowing what I
 
00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:37.619 align:start position:0%
know about the what's going on with the
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
with the federal waiver area based on
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
the work we're doing with
 
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
um you know getting everything in place
 
00:53:46.609 --> 00:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
for dental I think we're on the long
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
side of this just based on what the
 
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
workload that CMS has for example
 
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.309 align:start position:0%
workload that CMS has for example
um

00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
just just adopted in California which
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has an interest in as well
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
in our severely mentally ill and sud
 
00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:05.660 align:start position:0%
waiver the opportunity to address
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
justice-involved individuals in terms of
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
getting Medicaid to pay for some of the
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
transitional costs
 
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
they're just that that waiver alone
 
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
many states are interested and it's a
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
high priority for the administration so
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
trying to get people to work on
 
00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
less of a priority in terms of CMS in
 
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
terms of working through their waivers I
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
think is why I think it'd probably be on
 
00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
the long end
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
no I just to follow up
 
00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:35.390 align:start position:0%
no I just to follow up
so

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
at the department you have the resources
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
right now you could do this because it
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
sounds like if we're going to do it we
 
00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
need to get the paperwork done we need
 
00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
to get the application into CMS as
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible so I think if if I
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
could distinguish between
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
um adopting the policy that's in place
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
that's in the CMS letter that
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative referred to would be a
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
shorter process that's that's probably
 
00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
more like a six-month process I think
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
the question I was addressing I
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
apologize if I was not completely
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
responsive was if we were looking for an
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
exception or some change from what is
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
the established policy so it would take
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
around six months if we adopt this thank
 
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:16.250 align:start position:0%
around six months if we adopt this thank
you

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
yeah just to to make sure that we're
 
00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:21.890 align:start position:0%
yeah just to to make sure that we're
um

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
we're all understanding the same thing I
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to be repetitive but I think
 
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
when when Mr lippman talked about the
 
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.030 align:start position:0%
when when Mr lippman talked about the
um

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
large amount of money and large amount
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
of waiting time he was talking about and
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
tell me if I'm wrong it's as if we were
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
to deviate from the option that we can
 
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
just take if we just take the option I
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
don't think it involves the same amount
 
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
of time and certainly not this we don't
 
00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
have to hire an independent researcher
 
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:53.460 align:start position:0%
to to evaluate a different policy than
 
00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
um so when you said seven figures that
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
was to establish a kind of a new program
 
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh with a waiver that you know is based
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
upon this so in budgeting this program
 
00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
um you know assuming that we're
 
00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
following uh the established
 
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.990 align:start position:0%
following uh the established
um

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
what's allowable
 
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
um is the is the budget that we're
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
talking about in here sufficient to get
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
going with that so I think that the the
 
00:56:28.319 --> 00:56:29.450 align:start position:0%
going with that so I think that the the
budget

00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:30.170 align:start position:0%
budget
um

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
and I think we've submitted a
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
clarification I'm not sure if the the
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about 336 thousand
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
dollars for the biennium to cover
 
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
if we and that would be the expense for
 
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
following the current policy in place
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
that CMS has for this and and I would
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
just if I could just add one thing to it
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
is that people who are lawfully residing
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
is who what we're talking about
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
after five years they are going to be
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medicaid so the issue is is
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
by not providing The Upfront care are we
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
in the Medicaid Program assuming they
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
still continue to live reside in New
 
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:07.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire going to have a higher cost
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
situation to deal with than if they got
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
the appropriate preventative care up
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
front that's why I think the department
 
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
supports it because we think that we're
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to own the long-term care and
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
that's going to be much more expensive
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
if they haven't had the front end yeah
 
00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:23.099 align:start position:0%
that's that's Theory though right you
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't have any data on that that's a
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
numbers so that we're here in the budget
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
is primarily um
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
um you know for for providing the care
 
00:57:38.569 --> 00:57:38.579 align:start position:0%
for the new recipients and yes not for
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh not for the administration correct to
 
00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:45.140 align:start position:0%
get the program going yes which
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
is or is not a big number it would not
 
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.069 align:start position:0%
 
representable

00:57:55.069 --> 00:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
representable
 
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the original fiscal
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
note which was
 
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
um 448
 
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
per year or total 224 per year you just
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned a new one that was 336 I don't
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
336 for the biennium I don't have a copy
 
00:58:16.849 --> 00:58:16.859 align:start position:0%
of that so so the fiscal note talks
 
00:58:16.859 --> 00:58:17.589 align:start position:0%
of that so so the fiscal note talks
about

00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
448 thousand dollars per year half of
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
that is State funds half of that is
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds okay and the 336 thousand
 
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
dollars was um
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
put into the bill as an appropriation
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
through an amendment amendment 0160 I
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
don't know what you have in front of you
 
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
if it includes the amendment or not
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
um but this was passed through the house
 
00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago and um the
 
00:58:47.329 --> 00:58:47.339 align:start position:0%
amendment was just to clarify that we
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
now had to cover
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the biennium so
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
um the number that had been in there
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
previously was from the bill when it was
 
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
introduced last year when there was only
 
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
going to be six months of the biennium
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
um before the bill was effective thank
 
00:59:03.839 --> 00:59:08.150 align:start position:0%
um before the bill was effective thank
you

00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so there's a casual Observer of a
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
history on this
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
a hundred years or so when we were doing
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
immigration policy
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
for somebody to immigrate into the
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
United States so generally needed to
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
find a sponsor and they would come to
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
the United States with the commitment
 
00:59:29.569 --> 00:59:29.579 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't add to the social
 
00:59:29.579 --> 00:59:31.089 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't add to the social
costs

00:59:31.089 --> 00:59:31.099 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:59:34.329 --> 00:59:34.339 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
that policy evolved and for quite a
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
while we had a five-year wait period and
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
and I think to represent Weiler's point
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
the idea was let's put this five-year
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
wait policy in so that our social
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
benefits are not a magnet to the world
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
to get everyone to come here knowing
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
that they would be entitled the benefits
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
immediately that's what that five-year
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
waiting period was for
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
and so as we've continued from that I
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
think it was a Clinton administration
 
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
that started to chip away at the
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
five-year waiting period
 
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:12.950 align:start position:0%
five-year waiting period
um

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:16.020 align:start position:0%
and we've opened up the door
 
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
Refugee status
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
meaning something different than what it
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
used to mean do we it's now more of a
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
catch-all phrase where people can
 
01:00:31.809 --> 01:00:31.819 align:start position:0%
run into
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
immigration system and declare that
 
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
they're in a refugee status and
 
01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:39.299 align:start position:0%
generally they get accepted and
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
protected and it's a huge loophole so
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
for those people
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
who who look at this and worry that
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
we're open up Medicaid we've got a
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
financial crisis that may come upon us
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
at the federal level we're certainly got
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
issues at the state level where we have
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
to manage our money we're opening up and
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
expanding eligibility here in a way that
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
really is inconsistent with the history
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
and while we may do it I don't know we
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
haven't decided but I I just I just want
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
to point out that there has been reason
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
why we've not done it yet you know
 
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.109 align:start position:0%
why we've not done it yet you know
so

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions or
 
01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:24.829 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions or
comments

01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
all right okay well thank you for for
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
stopping by I appreciate it
 
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here Dr Ballinger you're
 
01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
going to be speaking on 565 aren't you
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay come on up is there anyone else in
 
01:02:01.569 --> 01:02:01.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Mooney is
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
pointing out that you do have a revised
 
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal note amended the 6th of March on
 
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.829 align:start position:0%
fiscal note amended the 6th of March on
565.

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:12.839 align:start position:0%
565.
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
um go ahead and representative Shapiro
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
so the first thing I'd like to point out
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
that um is that house bill 565 is
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
another Federal option
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
um we're here to talk about Federal
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
options Federal Option Day and so this
 
01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
is another Federal option that was
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
created by CMS
 
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.370 align:start position:0%
created by CMS
um

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I will just say that for starters
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
that um there was a this was part this
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
identical bill was part of a senate
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill last year that passed the
 
01:02:50.569 --> 01:02:50.579 align:start position:0%
Senate and passed the house and then
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
went to a committee of conference and
 
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.650 align:start position:0%
went to a committee of conference and
um

01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
it didn't make it through the committee
 
01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
of conference but my understanding it
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
has had nothing to do with this this
 
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
part of the Omnibus Bill
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
um this was not in contention so
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be here talking today if
 
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
that um if it had been signed last year
 
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
so once again this is a bill that um
 
01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
takes a federal option that was created
 
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
to extend Medicaid postpartum benefits
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
from 60 days which it currently is to
 
01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:28.460 align:start position:0%
12 months
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
and the idea from this bill did not come
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
out of thin air it wasn't the brainchild
 
01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:35.030 align:start position:0%
out of thin air it wasn't the brainchild
of

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
um you know the person the sponsor of
 
01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:39.299 align:start position:0%
the bill or our committee this was a
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
bill that was created by this was an
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
option that was created by CMS to
 
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
address a very specific problem and that
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
problem is that the United States has a
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
much higher
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality rate than other
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
Western wealthy countries
 
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.950 align:start position:0%
Western wealthy countries
um

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
I didn't I didn't bring those notes but
 
01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:08.770 align:start position:0%
I think the United States was 17.4
 
01:04:08.770 --> 01:04:08.990 align:start position:0%
I think the United States was 17.4
[Music]

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
um maternal mortalities
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
per 100 000 live births a country like
 
01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
the Czech Republic was four Poland was
 
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
one so it's kind of an acknowledged
 
01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
problem which maybe the doctor will talk
 
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
more about
 
01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
um and so this this option was put into
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
effect to deal with that problem that we
 
01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
have in the United States and once again
 
01:04:39.849 --> 01:04:39.859 align:start position:0%
about 35
 
01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
states have taken this option I see we
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
have a map here
 
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.670 align:start position:0%
have a map here
um

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the um one of the
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
things that um
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
during our hearings
 
01:04:58.849 --> 01:04:58.859 align:start position:0%
um another bill which is about a
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
completely different
 
01:05:00.119 --> 01:05:00.890 align:start position:0%
completely different
um

01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.690 align:start position:0%
um
subject

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:02.700 align:start position:0%
subject
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
um which was also um sponsored by um
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
the chair chair Edwards
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
um was about
 
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:11.930 align:start position:0%
um was about
um

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
the maternal mortality studies that
 
01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
happened in New Hampshire and um so um
 
01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
we we got the most recent report and I
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
looked at that and it said that a great
 
01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
number of the deaths postpartum occurred
 
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
between the period of 43 days and a year
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
after the birth of a child so I think it
 
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
was about 40 percent of the deaths in
 
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not a tremendous amount of
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
deaths but there it's a problem and
 
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's why we keep track of it every
 
01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:47.450 align:start position:0%
that's why we keep track of it every
year

01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:50.210 align:start position:0%
year
um

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
I think another thing to note with this
 
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
bill is this will only affect a portion
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
of people on Medicaid
 
01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.829 align:start position:0%
of people on Medicaid
um

01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:00.839 --> 01:06:02.750 align:start position:0%
um
currently

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
and once again Mr Littman would know the
 
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
more specific details but currently
 
01:06:11.289 --> 01:06:11.299 align:start position:0%
people who are on expanded medicaid
 
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
who would get benefits through Medicaid
 
01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:16.730 align:start position:0%
who would get benefits through Medicaid
um

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
are eligible if they earn 133 percent or
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
less of the federal poverty level so
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
anybody on expanded medicaid who
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
um got pregnant had a child
 
01:06:31.079 --> 01:06:32.029 align:start position:0%
um got pregnant had a child
um

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
and then reach two months postpartum
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
they would continue to be on Medicaid by
 
01:06:40.309 --> 01:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
virtue of the fact that they were
 
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
still had a low income
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
but there's another category of people
 
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
who are eligible for Medicaid because
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
they're pregnant and that goes up to 196
 
01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
percent of federal poverty level and
 
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's those people really who
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
um would lose their Who currently lose
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
their postpartum benefits after two two
 
01:07:02.809 --> 01:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:06.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
once again I think this is a bill that
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
would affect not that many people
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
but the people it would affect it would
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
have the effect of strengthening
 
01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
families supporting children
 
01:07:19.859 --> 01:07:21.730 align:start position:0%
families supporting children
um

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:21.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
supporting mothers and it's not just the
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
health care that mothers would continue
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
to get it's that they it would improve
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
it would enhance their ability to parent
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
their children through that first year
 
01:07:37.319 --> 01:07:38.690 align:start position:0%
their children through that first year
of

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
um life of the children
 
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
so I think this is a bill that passed
 
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:45.260 align:start position:0%
last year or almost passed last year
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that strengthens families
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
and I think this is a bill that we
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
Dr Bellinger
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and committee
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
members my name is Jonathan Ballard I
 
01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.529 align:start position:0%
members my name is Jonathan Ballard I
work

01:08:02.529 --> 01:08:02.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.930 --> 01:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
I work as the chief medical officer for
 
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
Services I'm a family physician by
 
01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.730 align:start position:0%
Services I'm a family physician by
training

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
um you know taking care and still
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
actively and clinically active taking
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
care of mothers and babies
 
01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
the I was asked to look at the clinical
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
rationale for this bill and so in doing
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
so I look back at what was expressed as
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
the rationale when it was presented at
 
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
the other states I looked at uh so this
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
coverage that exists in Florida
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
Mississippi Georgia South Carolina
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
Indiana Ohio and I believe Governor
 
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
Abbott in Texas has proposed it as part
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
of his budget this year
 
01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of making its way through
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
through a number of states and so in New
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have had about 3 300 births
 
01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
for persons who were covered by Medicaid
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
each year for the past five years and of
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
that category that representative
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
Shapiro was
 
01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.769 align:start position:0%
Shapiro was
um

01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:11.169 --> 01:09:11.179 align:start position:0%
was mentioning uh would be around 550 to
 
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
750 births of the mothers who would lose
 
01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage now this has not been
 
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
an issue for the last three years
 
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
because of the continuous Medicaid
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment that we were obligated to
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
maintain uh in order to perceive The
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
increased Federal match during the
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic but that is going away
 
01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
and so then this this has become more of
 
01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
an issue today than it was last year
 
01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
so the common medical issues that happen
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
from Days 60 to the end of the uh year
 
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
are numerous I put them in two
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
categories there's the conditions that
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
are common that are less severe but may
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
have impact on the mother and child and
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
then there are severe conditions that
 
01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
have you know catastrophic traumatic
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes the less severe medical
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
conditions that happen I see this
 
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
commonly uh you know the baby blues we
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
have a spectrum of the baby blues but
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
with more severe
 
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
um postpartum depression so the baby
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
blues are common happens around 70
 
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
percent of for mothers and there are
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
proven well-known interventions that can
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
help they typically they'll last beyond
 
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
you know the 60 days so that's one
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
intervention that the mothers would
 
01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.410 align:start position:0%
intervention that the mothers would
receive

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:23.420 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:27.620 align:start position:0%
the other one is contraceptive care
 
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:29.290 align:start position:0%
the other one is contraceptive care
many

01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:29.300 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
persons or mothers choose to receive
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
something called an entry uterine device
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
it's a form of contraception it's a
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
long-term contraception
 
01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:40.820 align:start position:0%
um and it's typically though not
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
eligible in the first 60 days that's
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
something that we could choose later on
 
01:10:48.649 --> 01:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
if they would wish to do so the other
 
01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
thing that hap that's
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
coverage is for breastfeeding and
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
lactation support we know a whole host
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
of outcomes that happen from a clinical
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
benefits of breastfeeding and what it
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
has for the immune system of the baby
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
and for the prevention reduction of
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
breast cancer risk from other
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh we also see a number of physical
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
conditions or for mothers I've treated a
 
01:11:12.649 --> 01:11:12.659 align:start position:0%
number of them who've had you know
 
01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:15.900 align:start position:0%
chronic pain syndromes uh needed some
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
additional physical therapy or
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy to return back to
 
01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
work the workforce
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
so that's something that would be uh you
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
know Common issue that this could be
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
covered the other common fairly common
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
is a gestational diabetes is diabetes
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
so sometimes that gestational diabetes
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
goes away sometimes it continues and
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
their diabetes obviously is a very
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
expensive disease and has a lot of
 
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
clinical outcomes if it's not treated so
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
Dion 60 days this would be something
 
01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
that I would expect that this would
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
benefit would um would be something that
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
would allow for treatment for
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
again though less common but very severe
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh the post-operative
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
depression or postpartum psychosis
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's very rare but does happen uh and
 
01:12:04.970 --> 01:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
it could have terrible outcomes as far
 
01:12:06.610 --> 01:12:06.620 align:start position:0%
as for the mother and child and family
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
we also see in New Hampshire and across
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
the country and world uh substance use
 
01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
disorders opiate use disorders alcohol
 
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
use disorder and we also see still a
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
number of mortalities related to
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular events even beyond the 60
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
maternal severe maternal outcomes
 
01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
including death
 
01:12:38.649 --> 01:12:38.659 align:start position:0%
from 2018 to 2020 nationally there was 2
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
273 mothers who died in the Perry
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
postpartum area and a couple died in New
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are you able to rescale those
 
01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
numbers so that we're talking New
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right from 2018 to 2022
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
mothers died in New Hampshire in this
 
01:12:55.739 --> 01:12:58.250 align:start position:0%
mothers died in New Hampshire in this
category

01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
so this leads to something that is
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
considered adverse childhood experiences
 
01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
for for for children in adverse
 
01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences when the child
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
experiences a traumatic event like a
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
loss of a parent separation from a
 
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
parent because of uh incarceration or
 
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
divorce or or set physical separation
 
01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:20.330 align:start position:0%
divorce or or set physical separation
otherwise

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh there's a whole host of other adverse
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences that we know have
 
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
strong connections with their the child
 
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
developing their own problems later in
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
life not only mental health issues but
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
also physical health conditions even
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
even chronic diseases
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
um we know that uh persons who develop
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
opiate use disorders and overdose deaths
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
have a strong relationship with adverse
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences so it's sort of a
 
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.209 align:start position:0%
childhood experiences so it's sort of a
generational

01:13:49.209 --> 01:13:49.219 align:start position:0%
generational
 
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
intervention that's being proposed today
 
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
from my review what's been proposed in
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
the other states so the idea is that
 
01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.810 align:start position:0%
the other states so the idea is that
um

01:13:59.810 --> 01:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
by intervening as early as possible
 
01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:06.140 align:start position:0%
Upstream providing that uh
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
mother who is Medicaid eligible
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
already with the continued service for
 
01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
the following year that they would
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
continue to have access to Medical Care
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
parenting skills parenting classes that
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
could be covered and help lead to better
 
01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
outcomes for the but not the mother but
 
01:14:26.209 --> 01:14:26.219 align:start position:0%
also the the Next Generation and to
 
01:14:27.649 --> 01:14:27.659 align:start position:0%
break that cycle now New Hampshire is
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
one of the healthiest states in the
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
country and we have some of the best
 
01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
outcomes of Health diseases but in this
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
area this is something particularly we
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
recognize in New Hampshire with opiate
 
01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:39.500 align:start position:0%
use disorder
 
01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
and suicides that uh that could be of
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
benefit to help keep us you know at the
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
top of the country
 
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's that's the
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
clinical rationale
 
01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler I thank you Mr
 
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
chairman what percentage of the births
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are Medicaid births
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know the number of that I have
 
01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.890 align:start position:0%
I don't know the number of that I have
to

01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
are there other questions
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
you know Dr Ballard one thank you for
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
tolerating the fact that I can't
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
remember your name very well it's old
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
age slipping in
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
um and the other for putting together
 
01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
the clinical presentation side of this
 
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
as I'm as I'm listening to you and I'm
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what the impact
 
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
that this um this additional money may
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
have on making programs available there
 
01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:43.640 align:start position:0%
there's probably at least three major
 
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
categories and you tell me if this is
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
bad thinking or not there's there's uh
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
the postpartum uh related to depression
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
which is you know getting the woman uh
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
counseling and perhaps some medication
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
and the other support to help with that
 
01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
then there are sort of the severe
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
clinical outcomes the diabetes the
 
01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
cardiac the those kinds of things and I
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
would think that even with this program
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
there would still be a significant
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
amount of mortality there I I'm just
 
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
having a hard time perceiving how this
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
particular program would reach into that
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
demographic and and actively change the
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
numbers maybe you could tell me that and
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
and then the third category are those
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
who are committed to substance abuse
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
he gets we can't do anything about it
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
because people are just so
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
self-destructive when they start to go
 
01:16:44.450 --> 01:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
down the substance abuse chain that this
 
01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:45.490 align:start position:0%
down the substance abuse chain that this
program

01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:45.500 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
may not really be helping them but maybe
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
some of the other substance abuse
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
Outreach efforts might so so those are
 
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
kind of the three ways I'm looking at
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
this in the three big buckets am I is
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
that is that a fair representation you
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
think representative Edwards I think
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
way to break it out and I think that the
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
interventions that are available through
 
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:08.940 align:start position:0%
Medical Care can prevent you know those
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
terrible outcomes in all three of those
 
01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
buckets but if they don't get care and
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
they don't delay care or they do delay
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
care then that's
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to set ourselves up for a
 
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:23.940 align:start position:0%
much more greater expense and and
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh detriment to society a longer term if
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
we don't during this little critical
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
window we're speaking about very small
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
percentage of our Medicaid population
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
very small percentage of Medicaid
 
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
population but a very big impact on our
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
state on our economy yeah I I I'm
 
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:42.780 align:start position:0%
agreeing with you I'm just letting you
 
01:17:45.169 --> 01:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
know that the other thing that we hear
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
whispered in our ear is we're
 
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
continually expanding Medicaid always
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
expanding Medicaid one you know this is
 
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
the cut by or the death by a Thousand
 
01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
Cuts and so it's just it just each time
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
we do one of these we just have to be
 
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
very sure why we're doing it is all
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
representative uh Shapiro I would I I
 
01:18:05.159 --> 01:18:06.410 align:start position:0%
representative uh Shapiro I would I I
understand

01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.870 align:start position:0%
understand
um

01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
you know I I understand the the
 
01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:13.490 align:start position:0%
you know I I understand the the
um

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
um that some people who use that abuse
 
01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.030 align:start position:0%
um that some people who use that abuse
substances

01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
substances
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
um are not that receptive to help and um
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
this does not force help on them
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and it it creates the option it
 
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
creates the availability for those
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
services for those who are motivated and
 
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
for those who pursue them and um
 
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
you know as you said we don't have a
 
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
very good track record with um treating
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
substance use this serious substance use
 
01:18:44.159 --> 01:18:45.290 align:start position:0%
substance use this serious substance use
disorders

01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:45.300 align:start position:0%
disorders
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
um but this makes help available for the
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
um are motivated and to take it and for
 
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
the ones that just
 
01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:57.050 align:start position:0%
the ones that just
um

01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
not interested then the state's not
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
going to end up paying for those
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
services for them
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I I just as we make
 
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
these you know represent a story in just
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
a second
 
01:19:08.159 --> 01:19:09.169 align:start position:0%
a second
um

01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
I I guess I just want to make it clear
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
that when we're when we're funding these
 
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:15.540 align:start position:0%
programs we should be doing it from a
 
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
realism perspective that we have we're
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
trying to do unlimited good but we're
 
01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:22.940 align:start position:0%
probably going to end up having limited
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
impact and that's just part of this I'd
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
like to thank you for mentioning my uh
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality bill I also want to
 
01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for not mentioning it went
 
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
down 19 to nothing in your committee so
 
01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
that was really good of you
 
01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
now it's hard to follow that up but I I
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understand uh
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
how this benefit plays out I mean
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
currently when when a patient who's
 
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
delivered two months ago
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
um they don't lose Medicaid altogether
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
right there or do they do they do uh
 
01:19:57.770 --> 01:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
that has not happened in the last three
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
years but if they are not otherwise in
 
01:20:05.149 --> 01:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
the income eligible bracket already
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and they got it because of the ex the
 
01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
higher percentage of the federal poverty
 
01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
level and because they were pregnant
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
they would lose it so so in that case
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
they would have gone back to work
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps after having the baby they're
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
above the the federal poverty level
 
01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:21.659 align:start position:0%
restriction and now they have no
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid at that point right and this
 
01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
would be irrespective whether they're
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
work or not it's it would be thank you
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
historical information
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
solorski thank you I'm just wondering if
 
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
Ballard can speak on
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
the impact to uh if there is a um
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
a woman who no longer has care 60 days
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
postpartum and has an unexpected
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
pregnancy due to lack of care either
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
contraceptive counseling or whatever if
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
those snowballing effects if you ever
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
see that result in
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
um you know even poorer outcomes
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
for the family or the mother after the
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
second birth I guess
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
I mean I haven't looked into those
 
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
demographic chains I can speak from my
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
own experience being a provider for
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
patients like that there are several
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
where you kind of rush to get everything
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
done before the 60th day before you know
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
that they're going to receive those
 
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
bills themselves
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
the IUD is one of the examples so it's
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
maybe a little too much but
 
01:21:33.659 --> 01:21:34.850 align:start position:0%
maybe a little too much but
um

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
when you meet when a mother immediately
 
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
gives birth the uterus is
 
01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
uh you know stretched and it's not a
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
time period that you want to use an IUD
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
as the primary form of contraception you
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
need a waiting period before it's safe
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh and this is a challenge when the
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
mother is going to lose health insurance
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
because then potentially she would no
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
longer have access to that form of
 
01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
contraception if that's her primary
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
choice of for how to use it so then you
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
start to use less effective forms of
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
contraception that could result in an
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
unintended pregnancy
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm just reflecting on my own
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
pregnancies at day 60 and how I was
 
01:22:19.729 --> 01:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
nowhere near ready to uh Take On The
 
01:22:19.739 --> 01:22:22.330 align:start position:0%
nowhere near ready to uh Take On The
World

01:22:22.330 --> 01:22:22.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:27.290 --> 01:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
to keep up with the image of being uh
 
01:22:30.649 --> 01:22:30.659 align:start position:0%
parsimonious uh is there an amount of
 
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
days that we could authorize it doesn't
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
go all the way to a year where we would
 
01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
still be hitting the greatest impact
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
like six months nine months Dr Ballard
 
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:44.219 align:start position:0%
from a clinical rationale it's I don't
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
have the evidence for six months or nine
 
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
months right they look at the
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
intrapartum period is one year
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
post-pregnancy it's recommended that you
 
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
do not become pregnant again for at
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
least one year after the previous
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
pregnancy so they sort of look at that
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
whole period of time as the interpartum
 
01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
period and that's where the evidence and
 
01:23:05.530 --> 01:23:05.540 align:start position:0%
the data looks at all right thank you
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
um you're already winning so just be
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:17.930 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.290 --> 01:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
I think Dr Littman has already spoken to
 
01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.550 align:start position:0%
I think Dr Littman has already spoken to
about

01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
um the advisability or not of trying to
 
01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
adapt the program from 12 months to nine
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
months or in terms of the expense and
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
the effort but I I would like to say one
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
thing and this maybe goes against your
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
advice but um I'll say it anyway I can't
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
help myself
 
01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
um you know I I
 
01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:44.219 align:start position:0%
I have certain assumptions
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
um just like everybody we make certain
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
assumptions about
 
01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:52.010 align:start position:0%
assumptions about
um

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know people who are wealthy or
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
people who are poor or people who are on
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or people who are immigrants
 
01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.149 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or people who are immigrants
and

01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
um certainly this didn't fit with my
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
assumptions but when I was um speaking
 
01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
to Mr Lipman the other day
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
um he advised me that 70 of the people
 
01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid in New Hampshire
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
um are working either part-time or
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
full-time so I think our I'll say it
 
01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:17.780 align:start position:0%
about myself
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
my assumption that people on Medicaid or
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.430 align:start position:0%
people who are
um

01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know not out there struggling in
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
some of the same ways that we are is
 
01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.410 align:start position:0%
some of the same ways that we are is
um

01:24:33.410 --> 01:24:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's not always the case and certainly I
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
I understand people's concern that
 
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:41.450 align:start position:0%
I understand people's concern that
Medicaid

01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
um can create some kind of depend
 
01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:47.219 align:start position:0%
dependence and I think that that's from
 
01:24:48.770 --> 01:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
my experience working as a therapist
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
with people on Medicaid for many many
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
years I think there's some reality to
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
that but I think it's just a small part
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
of the picture and I think there are
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
other things about Medicaid policy that
 
01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:01.820 align:start position:0%
we could change
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
to alter the incentives for people to
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
get on with their lives and to um
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
get more fully employed and make more
 
01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
money and get
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
employer-based health care
 
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to work on that bill if you
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
want to introduce it in January
 
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:24.540 align:start position:0%
all right so thank you very much for
 
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
coming by uh I think that wraps us up on
 
01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh 565 is there anyone else in the
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
audience that wanted to speak on 565
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to go on to
 
01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
House Bill 91 I'm going to introduce it
 
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon we'll move right
 
01:26:07.189 --> 01:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
there is a revised fiscal note that was
 
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
distributed by Mr Ripple prior to this
 
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
work session so be sure everyone is
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
aware of that house bill 91 and with
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
that we'll introduce a very familiar
 
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
individual to this division
 
01:26:23.209 --> 01:26:23.219 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards you're on all
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
right thank you madam chair uh
 
01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards District 31
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
of Rockingham I want to bring forward
 
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 91 with the amendment that
 
01:26:36.370 --> 01:26:36.380 align:start position:0%
was just referenced
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
some of you may recognize this bill this
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill passed in the house very easily
 
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
last term it was then taken hostage by
 
01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
the Senate and was used in a committee a
 
01:26:51.420 --> 01:26:52.810 align:start position:0%
the Senate and was used in a committee a
conference

01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:52.820 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
negotiation that the house did not
 
01:27:00.129 --> 01:27:00.139 align:start position:0%
accept and so it it died as collateral
 
01:27:04.129 --> 01:27:04.139 align:start position:0%
damage so I've reintroduced it this term
 
01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:07.940 align:start position:0%
it did well I think in
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
in Health and Human Services I believe
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
it was an 18-2 vote coming out of that
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
committee I believe this was on a
 
01:27:18.370 --> 01:27:18.380 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
what does it do it does three things
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
really two of them are just policy
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
issues that I would hope that the this
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee wouldn't take issue with and
 
01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
then there's a money issue that I'll
 
01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
talk about the first thing it kind of
 
01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:35.350 align:start position:0%
talk about the first thing it kind of
does

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
is is it establishes
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
that there should be a corporate-like
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
governance structure in the Department
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services looking at
 
01:27:50.649 --> 01:27:50.659 align:start position:0%
uh privacy issues and they would
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
invariably I think bring security into
 
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
that as well but but it's really a
 
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
privacy Focus uh corporations have done
 
01:28:00.350 --> 01:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
this to make sure that the leadership of
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
the corporations are intimately involved
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
and aware of the privacy issues that
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
their company deals with and so given
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
that we passed the Constitutional
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
amendment in 2018 to create a right to
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
privacy this is just an evolution within
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
the department to get the leadership
 
01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
fully engaged in the issue in a
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
comparable way to the corporate America
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing that it does is it
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
establishes a risk mitigation technique
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
that's used commonly in Corporate
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
America it's called I'm most familiar
 
01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
with it as a private see impact
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
assessment a privacy impact assessment
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
evaluates an I.T system for example
 
01:28:51.169 --> 01:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
before it goes live to to look at it to
 
01:28:54.129 --> 01:28:54.139 align:start position:0%
determine what its security controls are
 
01:28:57.649 --> 01:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
what the personal data is it's being
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
used how it's being used who's using it
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
how it's going to be stored how it's
 
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
going to be encrypted when it's moved or
 
01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:08.219 align:start position:0%
how it's going to get deleted at the end
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
of its life and how notifications to the
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
data the the consumer who owns their
 
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
data how how that will be managed those
 
01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessments
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
essentially say okay here's everything
 
01:29:26.209 --> 01:29:26.219 align:start position:0%
we know about this system here are the
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
risks that we see and increasingly
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
they're really more procedural on how to
 
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
deal with the data but but whatever the
 
01:29:37.490 --> 01:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
risk is there should be a mitigation
 
01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
plan meaning you can you can't get rid
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
of all risk that's not the world we live
 
01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
in but if you can identify the risk then
 
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
you can mitigate the risk so that the
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
chances of damage is lowered and so that
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessment is is a common
 
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.070 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessment is is a common
tool

01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
tool
 
01:29:57.770 --> 01:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm recommending that the department
 
01:30:02.890 --> 01:30:02.900 align:start position:0%
use them the um the last part of it is
 
01:30:05.689 --> 01:30:05.699 align:start position:0%
because the governance board and because
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
these privacy impact assessments are new
 
01:30:12.010 --> 01:30:12.020 align:start position:0%
to the department
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
looked at it and in discussion with the
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
Department to determine that
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
there are some unique job qualifications
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
that the department does not currently
 
01:30:28.129 --> 01:30:28.139 align:start position:0%
have there's there's a kind of a you
 
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
know if you look at a Venn diagram of
 
01:30:32.450 --> 01:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
three big bubbles somebody has to be
 
01:30:35.090 --> 01:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
pretty good on I.T security they have to
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
be really good at privacy
 
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
Concepts and then they have to really be
 
01:30:43.010 --> 01:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
good at project management to go out and
 
01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
talk to people and to figure out what
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
should be done in order to address any
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
issues and so those that that that skill
 
01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
set's a bit unique in the department so
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
these two positions were identified as
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
the appropriate job classifications for
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
those personnel and that's why there is
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
a change in the um in the fiscal note
 
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
because the job classification was
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
corrected from the the first go-around
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
and so I think if the department took or
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
the department excuse me if this
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee took any issue with any of
 
01:31:23.870 --> 01:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
this bill it would be about the two
 
01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
Personnel you know and um and you know
 
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
so so somebody had were to propose an
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be one way to deal
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
with this but I would certainly want the
 
01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
policies to be going into effect and
 
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions
 
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
all set
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
the Department's here if you want to
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
hear from them they came in special just
 
01:31:54.530 --> 01:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
so that they could present so absolutely
 
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
I see Mr Wieters and also
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:32:02.030 --> 01:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
and your title Mr Gillen
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone for the record I
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
am Ernie Killen my title is deputy
 
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
director for Information Services for
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services thank you and
 
01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
that was so expertly presented
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
I can answer any questions or support if
 
01:32:25.729 --> 01:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
sure I can go ahead and add if there are
 
01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
any questions at this point sure and
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
with me is director David Wieters
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
director of Information Services as well
 
01:32:36.649 --> 01:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
we were dividing and conquering as he
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
was presenting a capital budget in a
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.719 --> 01:32:43.669 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
sure I'm sorry is that better
 
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
great is that better
 
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes so data privacy and security is an
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
extremely important aspect of how the
 
01:32:56.930 --> 01:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
department operates every day
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
Information Services has worked in
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the sponsors
 
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
surrounding the formation language of
 
01:33:03.709 --> 01:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
and looking at the composition of the
 
01:33:07.129 --> 01:33:07.139 align:start position:0%
board members which includes the Health
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
and Human Services commissioner as well
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
as the department of Information
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
and the intended roles and
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the board it would
 
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
formalize data governance which is an
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
ongoing effort by the department
 
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:24.780 align:start position:0%
improving the privacy and security
 
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessments are an
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
important part of data privacy and
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
security of the data but time consuming
 
01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.990 align:start position:0%
security of the data but time consuming
effort

01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
the appropriation of the two positions
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
with the skill sets identified and
 
01:33:42.590 --> 01:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated to support the outline
 
01:33:44.530 --> 01:33:44.540 align:start position:0%
outlined roles and responsibilities
 
01:33:47.870 --> 01:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
identified in this bill and specifically
 
01:33:52.010 --> 01:33:52.020 align:start position:0%
working on privacy impact assessments
 
01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:52.550 align:start position:0%
working on privacy impact assessments
um

01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:55.460 align:start position:0%
would certainly be a an enormous
 
01:33:57.890 --> 01:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
assistance to developing the best
 
01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
systems possible creating data privacy
 
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
all set with your presentation okay Mr
 
01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
wieders anything to add to that
 
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
nope thank you very much for having me
 
01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
but no I wouldn't I would just be
 
01:34:19.790 --> 01:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
reiterating what representative Edwards
 
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
introduced as well as
 
01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
Ernie Gillen just presented we did work
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
in concert with many of the sponsors of
 
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
the bill in the previous legislative
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
session we we believe that this bill
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
moving forward would enable us to
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish data privacy and Security in
 
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
a much more intentional way and with
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
that appropriation would allow us to
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
actually be able to accomplish those
 
01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
privacy impact assessments that
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards introduced thank
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you and given the history of
 
01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
this bill it sounds like you've been
 
01:34:54.350 --> 01:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
waiting for it for a long time is that
 
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
an accurate assessment
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
um certainly we've we've been working I
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
think I've been working with
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards since I started
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
here in May of 2018 talking about
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
privacy and security
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
um so this is something that's part of
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
um our nature in nit is to maintain
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
privacy and security but it is the
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
culmination of long-term efforts of
 
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
trying to really not only from an
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
executive branch but also a legislative
 
01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
executive branch but also a legislative
branch

01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
branch
 
01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
um come to come together and figure out
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
how we can achieve our goals of
 
01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
providing good services to our citizens
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
and individuals in our state but with
 
01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:34.010 align:start position:0%
and individuals in our state but with
privacy

01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
in mind as well as the security
 
01:35:39.890 --> 01:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
very good any further questions
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham do you uh
 
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
foresee these or people that you have
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
available that you would reassign from
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
other areas or do you think this would
 
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
be new hires and how would that impact
 
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh how quickly you'd get started
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question certainly
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
they would be new hires on the The
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
Challenge right now so Information
 
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
Services on the group that I manage is
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
five people we have one information
 
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
security officer we have one privacy
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
officer that's not in my my Bureau and
 
01:36:11.209 --> 01:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
those are the two Primary people focus
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
on privacy and security this would
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
expand it essentially increase it by a
 
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
hundred percent so it allow us to
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
achieve things much more quickly in
 
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
concert with Department of information
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
Technologies but we would be recruiting
 
01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:25.669 align:start position:0%
Technologies but we would be recruiting
them

01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
the the titles as they are listed in the
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill and the grade level and step level
 
01:36:33.970 --> 01:36:33.980 align:start position:0%
is it commensurate with what we have
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
recently in the last year year and a
 
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
half have seen that we can successfully
 
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
recruit into and that was part of the
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
commitment of working with the sponsors
 
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
that instead of starting it off at like
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
a grade 29 step one where not many
 
01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
people would apply for those jobs we we
 
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
went and did our own research internally
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
said when we hire an information
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
technology manager for at step five we
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
have been successful at recruiting those
 
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
people and did I hit that wrong
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
Ernie it's going to correct me
 
01:37:08.209 --> 01:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
step seven sorry we have been able to
 
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
recruit those positions effectively
 
01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
it's been difficult in the pandemic but
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
it's increasingly difficult not only for
 
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
public sector but for private sector
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
right now in the I.T Fields so having
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
that position those positions
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
appropriated at those levels give us the
 
01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get those and one night
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
to give me a time frame I would say
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's about six to eight week time
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
frame to recruit
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
well follow up can you um just comment
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
it all about uh kind of how you see this
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
working is this like something that gets
 
01:37:46.450 --> 01:37:46.460 align:start position:0%
added on to uh every uh you know
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
electronic information exchange system
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we have and it's a maybe a module
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
on there or is this something you see
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
operating independently in Standalone
 
01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
where you go out and kind of check all
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
the opportunities for data breaches
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of both hand on on
 
01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
the answer to that so the Privacy impact
 
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
assessment right now we actually
 
01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
introduce into our standard boilerplate
 
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
contracts it says that we can at any
 
01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:14.689 align:start position:0%
contracts it says that we can at any
time

01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:14.699 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
require a privacy impact assessment be
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
performed on any of our contracts and we
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
we implemented that about a year ago
 
01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:24.900 align:start position:0%
the actual security assessments are also
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
in our standard boilerplate where we can
 
01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
do an audit on any of our vendors at any
 
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
time they're required to provide us
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
different information
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes them some time like
 
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
if we ask for a sock 2 report or if we
 
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
ask for different types of reports they
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
might be in the process of doing those
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
and they need to notify us as that
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
um we also will do the sort of ad hoc
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
when if there's an issue if there's some
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
challenges with the system we will then
 
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
also dig in a little bit deeper so it's
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
everyday thing but it is always at the
 
01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:05.699 align:start position:0%
time of of instantiating a contract it
 
01:39:09.649 --> 01:39:09.659 align:start position:0%
would be again done when we terminate a
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
contract with the vendor to make sure
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
that we get our data destroyed or or we
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
or we get the data into our environment
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
and then they destroy it on their side
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
because that's part of the contracts as
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
well contract agreements and then
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
throughout we will do different
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
assessments as needed based off of
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
many different lenses and perspectives
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
and reasons hopefully that answered your
 
01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.450 align:start position:0%
and reasons hopefully that answered your
question

01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:40.430 --> 01:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
did thank you
 
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions your
 
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
presentation is quite timely we just had
 
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
a presentation of our own this morning
 
01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
regarding classifications levels and
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
grades and so it fits together quite
 
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
nicely you picked the perfect day well
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
or we did all right thank you both
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
gentlemen if there are no further
 
01:39:57.890 --> 01:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
questions anyone else in the audience
 
01:40:01.669 --> 01:40:01.679 align:start position:0%
here to talk or testify or contribute to
