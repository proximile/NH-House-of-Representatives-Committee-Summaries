just heard representative George Sykes
 
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.990 align:start position:0%
just heard representative George Sykes
uh

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
Lebanon Ward 2 Grafton 14 is the
 
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
district which is a new district for me
 
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
district which is a new district for me
and

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to introduce house bill 374.
 
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.210 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to introduce house bill 374.
um

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
the primary message that I would like to
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
impart to the committee is that first
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
and foremost this bill is about public
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
safety and the reason I say that is
 
00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:38.150 align:start position:0%
safety and the reason I say that is
because

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
based on the operating history of
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
multiple states of which there are more
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
than uh I think there's at least 17
 
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
States who have passed similar
 
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.509 align:start position:0%
States who have passed similar
legislation

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's been most
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
interesting about the passage of similar
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
bills is that for example in the state
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
of Connecticut where they have a similar
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill in in effect now and have for
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
one of the very first things they
 
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
noticed was that the amount of Hit and
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
Run crashes where people get into a
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
minor motor vehicle accident and then
 
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.449 align:start position:0%
minor motor vehicle accident and then
leave

00:11:13.449 --> 00:11:13.459 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:16.019 align:start position:0%
dropped dramatically
 
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:19.019 align:start position:0%
and the reason is because we can presume
 
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
we don't have a we don't know why people
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
were fleeing earlier but we can presume
 
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's because they have a driver's
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
license instead of not and so that's a
 
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:31.100 align:start position:0%
really important Public Safety message
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
and beyond that this bill envisions the
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make sure that all of the
 
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.490 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make sure that all of the
drivers

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
drivers
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
have gone through the proper vetting
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
procedure from DMV meaning that they're
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
either qualified to get a driver's
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
license because they have one from
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
another state or because they have
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
they have come in and they've taken
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
their written exam showing their
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
familiarity with the laws of New
 
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they have taken a
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
practical exam showing that they can
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
actually drive the car
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
successfully and so those are really
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
important considerations I would like to
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
believe that we as members of the
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
transportation committee are fully in
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
support of
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
um the good record that the DMV has
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
maintained from for keeping public
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
safety first and foremost in the state
 
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
with relative to Driver's Licenses
 
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.710 align:start position:0%
with relative to Driver's Licenses
um

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's really the most important piece
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to get to spend the time
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
with you for uh to talk about and there
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
will be other folks who'll follow me who
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
will have more information for you
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
um but I'd be happy to entertain any
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
questions if uh if if I am able to
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
answer them
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.509 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair thank you um
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
when you tell people this in your
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
everyday walk around life what kind of
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
blowback do you get I mean what negative
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
comments would you get immediately on
 
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
well I think the the best way I can
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
answer that representative Sinclair and
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
um is that people do not really
 
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.129 align:start position:0%
um is that people do not really
understand

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:27.139 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose of the bill they get
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
they don't look into what what the real
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
thing is that they're TR that's trying
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
to be accomplished and so very
 
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
interesting I'll use as a a moral of the
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
story if you will
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
um last year when we when I introduced
 
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
this bill I had an excellent
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
conversation with them uh
 
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh member of the House from the
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
for me the other side of the aisle and
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
he just said to me well I can't vote for
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
this bill there's just no way
 
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019 align:start position:0%
and then I spent some time and explained
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
to him what what I was trying to achieve
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
with the bill I spent some time with him
 
00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:09.710 align:start position:0%
with the bill I spent some time with him
to

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
talk about details
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
at the end of which he said
 
00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:15.470 align:start position:0%
at the end of which he said
oh

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
well I can support that bill and and in
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
fact at one point he was a co-sponsor
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
with me for one one time when I put this
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
bill in actually that conversation
 
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.550 align:start position:0%
bill in actually that conversation
happened

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none they're letting off letting
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%

the midst of the current chaos and
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
backlogs that currently characterize our
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
immigration system and that aren't doing
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
any of us any good much less immigrant
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
families in New Hampshire
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm here on behalf of that

submitted by email so I'll just lift up
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
a few of our
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
um priority messages on this so this
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
bill as you likely understand would
 
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
simply allow people without Social
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
Security numbers
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
including undocumented immigrants living
 
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to apply for and obtain
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver licenses as long as
 
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
they qualify under every other category
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
of licensure in the state
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
um it's important to point out that
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
being undocumented is not in and of
 
00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:38.579 align:start position:0%
itself a criminal offense it is a civil
 
00:16:38.579 --> 00:16:40.550 align:start position:0%
itself a criminal offense it is a civil
offense

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
offense
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
um but when people drive without a
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
license then that engages the criminal
 
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
legal system in ways that are not
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
um helpful for them or we would argue
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
for the criminal legal system
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
the primary benefit of this bill is that
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
it would increase Public Safety which is
 
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
a Bedrock obligation of the state to its
 
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.470 align:start position:0%
a Bedrock obligation of the state to its
people

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
because undocumented residents are not
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
currently eligible for driver licenses
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
there's no systematic oversight of this
 
00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
group of people so permitting licensure
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
for otherwise qualifying individuals and
 
00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:21.419 align:start position:0%
their families would enable law
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement and other state agencies to
 
00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
accurately and positively identify the
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
person there would be more effective
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
regulation of this group of Motor
 
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
Vehicle operators
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
there would be safer operation of Motor
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles because the the license Holder
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
will have proven who they are where they
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
live and that they have passed the
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
required testing
 
00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
and there would be an increase in
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
insured drivers which certainly doesn't
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
benefit only the Immigrant driver but
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
anybody they might encounter in a road
 
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.150 align:start position:0%
anybody they might encounter in a road
incident

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
incident
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
we also believe that this bill removes
 
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:07.340 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary burden on law enforcement
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
who would need to prosecute actions of
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
driving without a license but in this
 
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:16.700 align:start position:0%
case that would remove that risk of that
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
unauthorized Behavior
 
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
it would decrease the fear of law
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
enforcement and immigrant communities
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
who often have good reason not to
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
cooperate even when their victims or
 
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
Witnesses of crime because of uh fear of
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
of what that engagement might mean to
 
00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:36.539 align:start position:0%
them or their inability to demonstrate
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
their identification
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
and it would increase the well-being of
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
immigrant families in New Hampshire many
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
of whom and perhaps most of whom include
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
U.S citizen children Partners Etc most
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
of the Immigrant families in New
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are mixed status families
 
00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:57.419 align:start position:0%
of the representative mentioned what are
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
some of the objections that we hear in
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
the community as we talk about the need
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
for this bill and certainly one that
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
comes up a lot is the fear of voter
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
fraud but we want to just lift up the
 
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
very obvious point that there are tens
 
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:13.740 align:start position:0%
of thousands of licensed drivers in New
 
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are not eligible to vote
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
and our Municipal clerks know how to
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
handle that uh on voting day or when
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
receiving requests for absentee ballots
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
so it's it's more of a straw man than it
 
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.669 align:start position:0%
so it's it's more of a straw man than it
is

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
and also we also want to make it clear
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
that the possession of a driver's
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
license doesn't confer any federal or
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
state benefits for which a person might
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
uh otherwise be ineligible it is simply
 
00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
saying that in New Hampshire if you can
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
prove who you are where you live and
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
that you've passed the required tests
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
that will give you a license to drive
 
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
legally on our roads and a way of
 
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419 align:start position:0%
purchasing insurance
 
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
and I just want to lift up uh we have
 
00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
experienced on a range of issues related
 
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
to immigrants lawfully present
 
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
immigrants primarily but all categories
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
of immigrants we have experienced such a
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
welcoming uh reception from the
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and the Division of
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles who sincerely want our
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
driver license offices and other safety
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
initiatives to be receptive to people
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
regardless of their language needs
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
or encounters that they might have
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
within the system that are that are
 
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
confusing for them so we're hopeful for
 
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
an ongoing productive conversation with
 
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
them to continue as has been going on
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
especially in the past year and a half
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer any questions you
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
might have to the best of my ability
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.049 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%

next up
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes Eva Castillo
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
Castillo representing herself in support
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill looking for three minutes
 
00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:15.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
my name is Eva Castillo I'm a resident
 
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
of Manchester I'm an immigrant rights
 
00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
Advocate I have been here in New
 
00:21:26.289 --> 00:21:26.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since
 
00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:27.909 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since
1982

00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
1982
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
and part of my job is to Advocate but I
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
also serve as a police commissioner in
 
00:21:36.049 --> 00:21:36.059 align:start position:0%
Manchester and not that I'm speaking I'm
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
not speaking on behalf of the commission
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
but part of my role is to build
 
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
relationships between police and the
 
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
community like Maggie referred the
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
community are fearful of the police for
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
different reasons because the police for
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
the most part in our countries are not
 
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
what you see here they are not decent
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
human beings like here and it doesn't
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
work right so we come here with all
 
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:03.059 align:start position:0%
those things so I'm here to speak in
 
00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:06.179 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill with which which
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
would remove the barriers of immigration
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
status in obtaining a driver's license
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the current rules
 
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
deprive long-standing citizens and
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
members not in our community of a Modern
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
Life necessity a driver's license New
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a really bad
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
transportation system and most of our
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
immigrants are here in the prime working
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
years of their lives
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
the the characteristic of their jobs
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
they work mostly in service in the
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
service area so they can there's no
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
option for them to work remotely so they
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
all have
 
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
to drive
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
to to work they will have to drive to to
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
do their daily chores maintaining
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
immigration registrations to driver's
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
license eligibility guarantees that a
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
that there's hundreds of drivers taking
 
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
the risk of driving without a license
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
and potentially endangering themselves
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
and others because the state leaves them
 
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
they they do drive but they do not have
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
the training and they don't have the
 
00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:24.419 align:start position:0%
license the police officers have no clue
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
who they're dealing with when they stop
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
them they have to have somebody else
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
register their car uh they so they're
 
00:23:36.049 --> 00:23:36.059 align:start position:0%
more likely to lie or just flee the
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
scene of an accident because they they
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
just are not going to face the police so
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
as a matter of public safety don't you
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
want people to to be vetted to to to
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
know who they are to make sure that they
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
know the rules of the road to make sure
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
they pass the driver's ed test so that
 
00:23:59.570 --> 00:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
would put the whole community
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
in a much safer place and you know it is
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
a pragmatic issue of a public safety
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
problem right now we have no clue who is
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
driving who's in our roads and what
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
their capacity is to to really figure
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
out what to do uh when something goes
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
wrong or if they're really who say if
 
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
they're really who they they say they
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
are so our communities will be safer
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
when every uh person is a licensed
 
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:33.740 align:start position:0%
driver and Maggie touch on the point of
 
00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:36.539 align:start position:0%
concerns about voting and I've heard
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
that too I came into this country in
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
1976 as a student so I was on an F1 Visa
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
I've have always had a driver's license
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
since I came here I have worked in every
 
00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
single election as a volunteer for the
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
Immigrant Community since I came first
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
in Michigan and then in New Hampshire I
 
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
was not a citizen I could not vote and I
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
would never even consider I had never
 
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
heard anybody that is a student or is in
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
any type of Visa that allows them to
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
driver's license even consider voting I
 
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
became a citizen in the late 90s and
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
that was the first time in my life that
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
I was able to vote and it was the
 
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
greatest day in my life I went straight
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
from the courthouse here in Concord to
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
City Hall in Manchester not even stop
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
for coffee to register to vote because
 
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
after so many years of not being able to
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
do it and trying to motivate those that
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
had the right to exercise that right you
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
know so there's already balance checks
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
and balances in place and rest assured
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
that you know that's not going to be the
 
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.169 align:start position:0%
that you know that's not going to be the
case

00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
so thank you and I hope you consider
 
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
this bill favorably and I second the
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
kudos to the DMV and to the Department
 
00:25:59.169 --> 00:25:59.179 align:start position:0%
of Safety they have really reached a
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
really uh across the the aisle they had
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
really made open conversations with us
 
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
and makes a made us feel like we can
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
trust and we have you know a trusting
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
relationship and respectful relationship
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
with them that those that does not
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
happen with many other offices thank you
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative Staub thank you for
 
00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:27.620 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
I'm curious
 
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.289 align:start position:0%
I'm curious
um

00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:32.169 --> 00:26:32.179 align:start position:0%
I don't really understand
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
who exactly this would cover for example
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
people who have applied for Refugee
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
status are they eligible to get driver's
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
license while they're waiting to have
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
their um
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
get get processed there are a bunch of
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
people that are not eligible to have to
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
have social security
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
like students you know people are in the
 
00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
process of adjusting their status to a
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
permanent thing this would apply to them
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
too as well as the people that really do
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
not have uh any any other means of
 
00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
adjusting their status but we have tons
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
of mixed status families where the
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
children are U.S citizens by birth that
 
00:27:18.529 --> 00:27:18.539 align:start position:0%
may be one of the parents is a legal
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
permanent resident and the other one is
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
undocumented so that would help a lot of
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
those people too okay thank you
 
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
committee representative Saint Claire I
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
have a question for you is anybody from
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
the DMV or their State Police or anybody
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
else going to testify unless I do not
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to ask a question that I
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
probably should have asked
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes but
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
it was it was testified that other
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
states have this already in place I
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
believe Connecticut was one of them so
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
if those people have a driver's license
 
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut and they're not
 
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.010 align:start position:0%
in Connecticut and they're not
documented

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
documented
 
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
up are they in fact allowed to drive in
 
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire now with that license
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
but they are residents of Connecticut so
 
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
I should suppose if they come to the
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
White Mountains for vacation they are
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
allowed to to drive in New Hampshire
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's a valid license but they're not
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
they're but they're not residents of New
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're we're just trying to get
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
people that reside in New Hampshire to
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
be able to drive I understand that I
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be clear about that thank
 
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:24.289 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be clear about that thank
you

00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
England thank you very much thank you
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.510 align:start position:0%
have a great day
foreign

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:39.260 align:start position:0%
next up Neil Kirk representing himself
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.409 align:start position:0%
 
greetings

00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:48.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
greetings Mr chairman to you and to
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
I am Neil Kirk I live in the town of
 
00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:54.830 align:start position:0%
I am Neil Kirk I live in the town of
where

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I am here representing myself I
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
00:29:00.059 --> 00:29:03.289 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
um

00:29:03.289 --> 00:29:03.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
there are there were statements made
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of this bill is to
 
00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
promote Public Safety and some
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
statistics were given from the state of
 
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.950 align:start position:0%
statistics were given from the state of
Connecticut

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
um I think the committee has a
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to further investigate
 
00:29:20.409 --> 00:29:20.419 align:start position:0%
whether there is a connection between
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
these kinds of additional licenses and
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
public safety for example in Connecticut
 
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
was the time period involved comparing
 
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.110 align:start position:0%
was the time period involved comparing
pre-covered

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
pre-covered
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
traffic statistics with covid traffic
 
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
statistics because we all know that
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
during covet fewer people were driving
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
so one would expect all sorts of driving
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
statistics to be lower during covet than
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
they were otherwise
 
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
if in fact there were 17 states that
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
have this there's a great D there should
 
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.020 align:start position:0%
be a great deal of information
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
to support or refute that claim and I
 
00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
hope the committee will investigate that
 
00:29:57.899 --> 00:29:59.450 align:start position:0%
hope the committee will investigate that
um

00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:03.169 --> 00:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
secondly I oppose this bill because it
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
encourages people who have
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
violated American laws illegal
 
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
immigrants or undocumented immigrants to
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
settle in New Hampshire
 
00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:14.039 align:start position:0%
that is to say
 
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
by facilitating an identification
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
document as well as a driver's license
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
because this bill does say that the
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
driver's license must be accepted as
 
00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:24.769 align:start position:0%
driver's license must be accepted as
identification

00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
identification
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
we are encouraging a group of people who
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
violated our laws to settle in our state
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's good policy for New
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but that's something I think
 
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go over a couple of the
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
provisions of the bill
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
suggest to support my position
 
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
section one which begins on page one
 
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
line 14.
 
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.370 align:start position:0%
line 14.
um

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
purports to deny access to anyone
 
00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
seeking to identify the type of license
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
one holds standard or real ID compliant
 
00:31:03.769 --> 00:31:03.779 align:start position:0%
but it takes away that protection by
 
00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
allowing the information to be given out
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
on the basis of a subpoena a subpoena
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
can be granted to just about anyone and
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't require probable cause it's a
 
00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
very low standard so if in fact the
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
ideas for protection here you might want
 
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:22.220 align:start position:0%
to reconsider that provision
 
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
section 3ec page one starting on page
 
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
one line 15.
 
00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.289 align:start position:0%
one line 15.
um

00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:30.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
supports this because it requires a
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
warrant supported by probable cause
 
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
in order for DMV to give data to
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
um Section 3 Ed starting on page one
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
line 25
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
requires a person who receives data from
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
DMV that it isn't used for import in
 
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me immigration enforcement
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
purposes but there's an exception
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
pursuant to a Cooperative Arrangement
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
between agencies such that the
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
arrangement does not enforce immigration
 
00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
law there's a five-year record-keeping
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
requirement and a five thousand dollar
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
civil penalty
 
00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
uh it seems that there's a whole group
 
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:19.940 align:start position:0%
of Provisions in here in this build
 
00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
which prevent immigration people from
 
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
getting access to this information so
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
that presumably to encourage people to
 
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:33.140 align:start position:0%
register get light illegal aliens to
 
00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
register and get licenses and be exempt
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
or prevent law immigration law
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
enforcement people from acquiring
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
information about them and using it and
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
I understand that that makes sense if
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
this is going to support a public safety
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
provision but there are all sorts of
 
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
ramifications Beyond Public Safety that
 
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
I think the committee should consider do
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
we really want MS-13 folks getting
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
you MS-13 is that criminal gang that
 
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.010 align:start position:0%
you MS-13 is that criminal gang that
operates

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
operates
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
in various Central American countries
 
00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:13.370 align:start position:0%
in various Central American countries
um

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
section three starting on page two line
 
00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:18.889 align:start position:0%
section three starting on page two line
26.

00:33:18.889 --> 00:33:18.899 align:start position:0%
26.
 
00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:21.419 align:start position:0%
allows drivers license to be used not
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
just for mission for permission to
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
operate a vehicle but as I said as a
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
form of identification
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
for all purposes
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
that legitimates the presence of an
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrant
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is that good public
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
I would suggest as some of the other
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
Witnesses have mentioned that this bill
 
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.389 align:start position:0%
Witnesses have mentioned that this bill
really

00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
involves voting or at least questions of
 
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
voting and perhaps it should go to
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
election law as a second committee if it
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
should pass this committee and the house
 
00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:02.090 align:start position:0%
should pass this committee and the house
floor

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
help New Hampshire in becoming a
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
sanctuary state
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
the prime reason however why I'm
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
testifying against this bill has to do
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
with Section 6 and 7 dealing it's a page
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
three line 30.
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
it requires an applicant for a non-real
 
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:38.220 align:start position:0%
ID license
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
to provide his social security number
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
now as some of you may know I'm very
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
concerned about privacy issues and one
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
of the ways you protect your privacy is
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
by keeping your social security number
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of government
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
would charge me and anyone else who
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
feels as I do a hundred fifty dollars to
 
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
maintain that privilege
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
I have three reasons why this is bad a
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
bad provision and should be stricken
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
from this bill even if the rest of it is
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
first there's no connection connection
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
between the amount of the fee and the
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
cost of providing the service that DMV
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
would do in not including your social
 
00:35:29.569 --> 00:35:29.579 align:start position:0%
security number in the form
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court has said
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
that for a fee to be legal
 
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
it must cover only two things number one
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of the service plus 25 percent
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
because sometimes you can't accurately
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
I'd be willing to bet my house
 
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:53.540 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to cost
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
DMV 150 to plug in a number or not plug
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
in a number on a form
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
so I believe this is on an
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional fee which would make it
 
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
a tax
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
and as a tax it doesn't meet the
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
requirements of our constitution so it's
 
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.390 align:start position:0%
requirements of our constitution so it's
illegal

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.310 align:start position:0%
illegal
secondly

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
this provision violates the
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
informational privacy Amendment to the
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution which the
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
folks the people of this state adopted
 
00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:25.260 align:start position:0%
it by an 81 percent vote in 2018 that's
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
part first article 2B
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
in that the government is in effect
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
through an outrageously disproportionate
 
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
fee requiring individuals to provide
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
personal information to the government
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
without it being absolutely essential
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
and the only way the government could
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
achieve a legitimate governmental
 
00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.950 align:start position:0%
achieve a legitimate governmental
purpose

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
we cannot require information of
 
00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:50.900 align:start position:0%
citizens under that Amendment unless
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
there is an essential government purpose
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
for it and the only way
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
the government can achieve that purpose
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
is by requiring that information
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
this meets those requirements
 
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
I believe it's bad public policy to
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
coerce New Hampshire residents
 
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.710 align:start position:0%
coerce New Hampshire residents
financially

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
financially
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
to maintain their privacy
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
I just don't think that's in the New
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tradition
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman that completes my
 
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
testimony and if there are any questions
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
from the committee members I'd be
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
pleased to try to answer them thank you
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
 
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.530 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any questions from the
committee

representative Sinclair good morning
um

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity you obviously have
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of reasons why you're not in favor
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
of this pill but have you reached out to
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
the DMV or the state police and asked
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
their opinion of of this
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
no I haven't because the issues the the
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
stated purpose of the bill
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
um or excuse me what this Prime sponsor
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
said representative Sykes was for Public
 
00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.829 align:start position:0%

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
that has not been my primary concern my
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
primary concern on this bill is the
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
Privacy issue which is really not part
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
of the State Police or the DMV
 
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.349 align:start position:0%
of the State Police or the DMV
um

00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
concern to some extent DMV would like to
 
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
have social security numbers because it
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
allows them to do certain other things
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
but there are workarounds for them to do
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
these other things they don't have to
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
have social security numbers and they've
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
survived very well for decades without
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
them okay so I didn't contact the State
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
Police or DMV because my concern was not
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
related to their issues okay thanks
 
00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:42.710 align:start position:0%
related to their issues okay thanks

some of you may know this some of you
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
may not know this but for
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
with two days notice
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
I was asked to go to the country of
 
01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.650 align:start position:0%
I was asked to go to the country of
Haiti

01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
Haiti
 
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
two days three days after the earthquake
 
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
and there I went I was supposed to be
 
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
there for a month I ended up being there
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
for nearly two years by the time
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
everything was done during that time I
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
began as a person doing working on their
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
cash transfer program I then became a
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
logistics person and finally became
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
director of facilities for the all the
 
01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:31.460 align:start position:0%
Red Cross facilities in the country
 
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
I witnessed
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
some disturbing things
 
01:00:41.329 --> 01:00:41.339 align:start position:0%
whether it's starving babies standing on
 
01:00:43.609 --> 01:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
the street corner dead bodies in the
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
street people
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely afraid about what's going on
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
I saw most of that they may not have
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
been shooting at me personally but
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
literally was shot at a couple of times
 
01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:57.380 align:start position:0%
during my time there
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
and all the time my Good Wife kept
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
saying yes when they asked me to stay
 
01:01:04.609 --> 01:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
longer which is why that one month
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
became almost two years
 
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
I had a young man work for me in the
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
logistics side of things and
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
um we paid him the princely sum of three
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a month which was a lot
 
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:22.260 align:start position:0%
of money actually then this this is now
 
01:01:27.049 --> 01:01:27.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
um he and I became very close working
 
01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.690 align:start position:0%
um he and I became very close working
um

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:35.289 --> 01:01:35.299 align:start position:0%
Partners if you will
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
um one of the jobs that I had him do for
 
01:01:44.289 --> 01:01:44.299 align:start position:0%
me was that
 
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
under Haitian labor law
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
you either hired somebody after two
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
weeks or you hired them for the day paid
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
them that day and then they went home so
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
because when you're trying to get
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
supplies into a country that has
 
01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
virtually no infrastructure you could
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
couldn't be guaranteed that
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
the for example for the cholera response
 
01:02:06.119 --> 01:02:07.670 align:start position:0%
the for example for the cholera response
the

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
one million cases of soap would arrive
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
on a particular day but when it did
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
start arriving you had to have the help
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
so we would hire temporary day workers
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
there were no forklifts etc etc it was
 
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
each case one person in a chain
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
unloading these trucks
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day those workers
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
had to be paid and
 
01:02:30.059 --> 01:02:30.829 align:start position:0%
had to be paid and
um

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
the young man's name is beeswood
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
beeswood would be the one who would pay
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
them this is important piece because
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
after I left Haiti I lost track lost
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
track of him and uh
 
01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:47.270 align:start position:0%
track of him and uh
about

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
seven years ago now so two years after I
 
01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
left Haiti I got a call
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
from beeswood and he said
 
01:02:59.329 --> 01:02:59.339 align:start position:0%
I've just sent my family out of the
 
01:02:59.339 --> 01:03:00.289 align:start position:0%
I've just sent my family out of the
country

01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:03:00.299 --> 01:03:01.730 align:start position:0%
country
because

01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
to the U.S on uh they had visas in order
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
to and a passport Haitian passport in
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
order to come
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
I just sent them out of the country
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
because it's not safe here for me
 
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
anymore and he proceeded to tell me how
 
01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:19.500 align:start position:0%
he and two other friends the three of
 
01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.210 align:start position:0%
he and two other friends the three of
them

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
were discovered if you will by the gangs
 
01:03:25.079 --> 01:03:26.450 align:start position:0%
were discovered if you will by the gangs
and

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
they murdered one of his friends and
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
they kidnapped beeswood and then they
 
01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
tried to extort the money
 
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.069 align:start position:0%
tried to extort the money
because

01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
for their eyes here was a guy was
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
handing out cash
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
so they thought he had money well of
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
course he didn't
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and so the good news is that he was
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
able to escape his kidnappers the bad
 
01:03:54.049 --> 01:03:54.059 align:start position:0%
news is that when that typically would
 
01:03:54.059 --> 01:03:55.670 align:start position:0%
news is that when that typically would
happen

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
The Gangs would then find
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
that person and his or her family and
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
murder them as well so there were no
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and so he needed to flee the
 
01:04:06.359 --> 01:04:07.370 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and so he needed to flee the
country

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:09.829 align:start position:0%
country
and

01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
we working with some church groups we
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
were able to get him out of again
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
legally into the United States and when
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
he got here he then applied for himself
 
01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:24.380 align:start position:0%
and his family for Asylum status
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:35.339 align:start position:0%
the way the process works is you can go
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
you you can you if you move into New
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or any other state in the
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
United States you can apply for Asylum
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
through the federal government
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
they give you a for lack of a better
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
term a receipt that says you've applied
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
for Asylum and when when possible
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
there'll be a hearing to see whether
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
your request for Asylum is a legitimate
 
01:04:55.799 --> 01:04:58.690 align:start position:0%
your request for Asylum is a legitimate
one

01:04:58.690 --> 01:04:58.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
we are now seven years waiting still for
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
that hearing seven years
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
in the meantime
 
01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:09.299 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have any work authorization
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
so he can't work he can't support his
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
family but at least they're safe and
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
they will survive
 
01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
the way the system further works on the
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
federal government side of things is
 
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:22.460 align:start position:0%
that after
 
01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
365 days one year
 
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
if you have not had your hearing you
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
will get
 
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
work authorization
 
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
which he then received a year later
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
once in possession of that work
 
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.309 align:start position:0%
once in possession of that work
authorization

01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
he could then go apply for a driver's
 
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
license take his tests and receive a New
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver's license and we all
 
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
know here in rural Northern New
 
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and by the way bees would move
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
to Lebanon where I had gathered a church
 
01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:57.180 align:start position:0%
group to help support him and his family
 
01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
while he was waiting to get his work
 
01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.170 align:start position:0%
while he was waiting to get his work
permit

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
permit
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
and so now he has a driver's license the
 
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
problem is from my perspective
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
and what this bill attempts to address
 
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.089 align:start position:0%
and what this bill attempts to address
is

01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law states that you must
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
if you move into New Hampshire you have
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
60 days to after 60 days you have to
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
have your New Hampshire driver's license
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
but in his case and in other asylis
 
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.609 align:start position:0%
but in his case and in other asylis
cases

01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
they can't apply for the driver's
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
license there's no provision for them to
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
get a driver's license at that time at
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to close the gap
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
between the 60 days when they should get
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
a driver's license and the 365 days that
 
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
has to go take place before they can
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
qualify for that driver's license that's
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
all this bill is trying to do
 
01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:57.299 align:start position:0%
um there I will tell you that there are
 
01:06:58.730 --> 01:06:58.740 align:start position:0%
some developments
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of this we'll we continue to
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
have discussions with the DMV about how
 
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:05.900 align:start position:0%
to best affect this but in the meantime
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
the I had submitted the bill and it may
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
be that it will ultimately require a
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
legislative fix that's what this was
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
about just trying to close the gap
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:24.299 align:start position:0%
um I'll entertain any questions
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:29.940 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Gorski
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes for taking my
 
01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.069 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes for taking my
question

01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned here you know
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
temporarily residing in New Hampshire
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
can you define what temporarily means
 
01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
so I I believe that um in the instance
 
01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
of the the kind of thing that I was
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
trying to describe to you for an asyli
 
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
request they are temporarily here until
 
01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:56.339 align:start position:0%
their Asylum hearing it could be
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
a matter of a couple of years or a year
 
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
it could be seven
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
I can't Define that more accurately
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
because I don't control the federal
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
immigration system and how how soon or
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
how fast the person will get their day
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
in court to prove whether they deserve
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
the right to be accepted as an asylum
 
01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
and get permanent
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh non-citizen status in the country and
 
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
oh by the way thank you for the question
 
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh representative one other thing I
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
would add that I think is pertinent to
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
in the intervening time since he got his
 
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:36.709 align:start position:0%
driver's license
um

01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:38.090 align:start position:0%
um

01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
folks may already be aware of so he is a
 
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:00.289 align:start position:0%
folks may already be aware of so he is a
productive

01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
productive
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
you part of our city he also is a

non-citizen resident of our of our city

and our state and that only became
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
possible when he could work and when he
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
could drive
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
because we all know rural Northern New
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a terror not a really
 
01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:26.450 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a terror not a really
great

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%

01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
for the questions from the committee

thank you Mr chair and um he's working

paying Social Security and uh state
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
tax but um Medicare and all all the ETC
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
you are correct he is paying Social
 
01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
Security and and all the other things
 
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
I'm looking through this uh bill here
 
01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
and it's on D it's a is is your intent
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
to have this license only good for 180
 
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
days or is it 180 days
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
renewed and then every up to five years
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
all right that's a great question thank
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
you for that so the intent is for it to
 
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
be a temporary license until they can
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
get their work permit and to close that
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
Gap from 60 days to 365 days and that's
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
not that unusual we have lots of folks
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
who are non-citizens who have a Visa for
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
instance who are here
 
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
and they are eligible for a driver's
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
license and they get one but when their
 
01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
visa expires so does the driver's
 
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
license and I I'm not sure I'm hopeful I
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
can have the exact numbers but we're
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
talking about tens of thousands of
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
people who have that type of driver's
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:11:05.530 --> 01:11:05.540 align:start position:0%
I've got one representative
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
once they have an asylum Seeker has
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
their receipt
 
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
and whether this passes or not you say
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't they've been waited after
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
a year they get their work permit if
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
this passes they can get it immediately
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
assuming it's good for 180 days what
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
happens after 180 days if they still
 
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
haven't gone to their hearing yet do
 
01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
they have to reapply
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
for another driver's license another
 
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.169 align:start position:0%
for another driver's license another
temporary

01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
well they they wouldn't have
 
01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
at 365 days the federal government will
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
automatically give the person their work
 
01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
permit which will then allow them to
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
apply for a driver's license under the
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
normal system
 
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.550 align:start position:0%
normal system
so

01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
if it expires because they're not well
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
let's say for the sake of discussion
 
01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
they they've had their hearing and
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're not approved while the driver's
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
license will go away
 
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
but again very narrow focus on this bill
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
is to just close that Gap
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
because I I guess I just would ask you
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
you live in a place where there's no
 
01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
public transportation to speak of
 
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
you willing able and want to work but
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
the system is that you have to wait 365
 
01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
the system is that you have to wait 365
days

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
and how do you get
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
these Woodworks for listen
 
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
that listen is Lebanon in service to
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
every neighbor that's an acronym for
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
that organization
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
they provide lots of services to people
 
01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
who need them how do you get to them if
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
you live up off of the bus route
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
how do you get there to get food
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
that is available to to pretty much
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
anybody who might need it
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
if you don't have a car and you can't
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
get there you have to depend on somebody
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
to take you
 
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
imagine having to depend on people
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
taking you everywhere you needed to go
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's a doctor's appointment
 
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.090 align:start position:0%
whether it's a doctor's appointment
and

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:16.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's to get food or medicine for
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
your family and you have to depend on
 
01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
outside folks
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's a challenge
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
I see it as a
 
01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.140 align:start position:0%
an unnecessary challenge if we can
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
legally get they're here legally and
 
01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
they'll have an opportunity to legally
 
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.630 --> 01:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and let me try my follow-up on
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
my own behalf I understand you're trying
 
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
to close the gap I I I I I see that but
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
I even the way the bill is written I
 
01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
still see a gap of 185 days if the
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
license expires after 180 waiting for
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
that work permit that comes after 365.
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
180 and 60 is how many days okay there's
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
the 60s in that too okay
 
01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.250 align:start position:0%
the 60s in that too okay
yeah

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's you see where I'm getting at well
 
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
now I see now I see a question but the
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
point I'm trying to make to you is that
 
01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
that it's like 180 days
 
01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
Gap not because they can't they can't
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
apply for a driver's license any sooner
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
than that they according to the DMV at
 
01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
the time this bill was written thank you
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
and again we're working on that we you
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
know we're always open to suggestions
 
01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:32.510 align:start position:0%
know we're always open to suggestions
and

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
um ways to make
 
01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
solve problems for our neighbors isn't
 
01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
that what we do as legislators listen to
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
our neighbors problems and try and find
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
Solutions yep any other questions from
 
01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up to your question just
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
so that I understand
 
01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
um a person coming in and seeking Asylum
 
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
there's the 60 days
 
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
um if this bill passes we will be they
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
will be able to apply for a driver's
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
license that is uh 180 day driver's
 
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
license that is temporary so we have the
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
three months there the two months
 
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
they've been here that's five months
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
what happens if they still don't
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
um don't receive their permit we still
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
have seven more months
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
will they reapply will they
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
yeah you're right it is a there's a
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
still a gap there I'm trying to remember
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
this bill was written as you see it
 
01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
um in conjunction with the former
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
director of DMV director baleki and I
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
forget I apologize I must be getting
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
senile in my old age
 
01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
um I can't quite remember but I think
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
that is probably part of the process
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
where they can reapply you know prove
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
that they're still here prove that they
 
01:15:59.209 --> 01:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
haven't got their work permit yet but
 
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
they that they're still on track to do
 
01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.470 align:start position:0%
they that they're still on track to do
so

01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
and I stand to be corrected about that
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
well ideally
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
they would get their permit and wouldn't
 
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
have to reapply but
 
01:16:16.850 --> 01:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
um but there is that Gap so I'll I'll uh
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
go back to my notes from last year maybe
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
we can yeah and I think it's something
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
we can look into as well yeah
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.490 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
committee

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
I have one more for you representative
 
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
I have one more for you representative
um

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
you said that if they are unsuccessful
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
getting their Asylum granted the license
 
01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
just goes away can you what what exactly
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
does that mean because my question is
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
what happens if they're denied Asylum
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
well that's the purpose of making it a
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
temporary driver's license so that it's
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
gonna it's gonna go away of its own
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
accord anyway it's something the DMV is
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
they watch people who are Visa holders
 
01:16:57.290 --> 01:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
and when the Visa expires the license
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
expires it's a normal practice for them
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%

01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
and convener of the New Hampshire
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
immigrant rights Network and we are here
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
in support of HB 375 we have written
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
testimony uh with more detail but I'll
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
just lift up some some key themes
 
01:17:59.930 --> 01:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
so Asylum petition adjudications are
 
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
complicated and they have historically
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
taken extended periods of time before
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
the government issues a decision
 
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
so built into the process is the
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity currently for an asylum
 
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
Seeker after a period of 150 days to
 
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
request work authorization EAD
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
employment authorization documents
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
because that document comes with a
 
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
social security number the person can
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
then go to the DMV and apply for a
 
01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:30.770 align:start position:0%
then go to the DMV and apply for a
license

01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:30.780 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
but what we've seen now over the last
 
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
several years is that once that
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
application is made at 150 days the wait
 
01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:42.659 align:start position:0%
time which would normally be about six
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
months has taken a year or even a year
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
and a half so it's a very protracted
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
period of waiting for an opportunity to
 
01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
uh to become an authorized worker which
 
01:18:58.850 --> 01:18:58.860 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't address at all and an
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
authorized driver
 
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire people are very aware
 
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
of this phenomenon because for the past
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
seven or eight years and plenty of times
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
historically as well but robustly in the
 
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
past seven or eight years communities
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
have organized themselves into local and
 
01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:21.300 align:start position:0%
Regional host home and Hospitality
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
networks in keen and the Upper Valley
 
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
and Nashua Manchester conquered the
 
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region and the Seacoast and I'm
 
01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:32.420 align:start position:0%
probably leaving somebody out
 
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:34.149 align:start position:0%
probably leaving somebody out
providing

01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
Hospitality perhaps in a church or in
 
01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
somebody's home or gathering resources
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
for an apartment and then providing a
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
lot of wraparound supports for the
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
Asylum seeking family and so we're much
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
more acutely aware of this very
 
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
protracted wait period than we might
 
01:19:55.850 --> 01:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
otherwise be because it wouldn't impact
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
our lives directly and what we see in
 
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
every instance is that people as
 
01:20:03.729 --> 01:20:03.739 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes mentioned people
 
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
are exhausted by being dependent upon
 
01:20:10.209 --> 01:20:10.219 align:start position:0%
others for their and their family's own
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
well-being there is such a desire I
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
think every healthy person I know wants
 
01:20:18.050 --> 01:20:18.060 align:start position:0%
to be able to care for themselves care
 
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
for their family's needs and act
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
independently and to not be able to
 
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
drive or to uh to work create just a
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
long period of a lot of nice people
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
helping you but not a lot of privacy and
 
01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
Independence for that family family so
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
so this bill by bridging that Gap in
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
what I understand to be a renewable
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
license until a more permanent option is
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
available gives that household a lot
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
more Independence for taking their
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
children to school or to medical
 
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
appointments or grocery shopping Etc so
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
we see this as a common sense proposal
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
coming out of our experience walking
 
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
with Asylum Seekers who are legally
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
present in the United States going
 
01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
through the proper channels to request
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
Asylum here and so we hope for your
 
01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:14.090 align:start position:0%
Asylum here and so we hope for your
support

01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
01:21:19.729 --> 01:21:19.739 align:start position:0%
seeing then thank you very much thank
 
01:21:19.739 --> 01:21:23.570 align:start position:0%
seeing then thank you very much thank
you

01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh next up the chair recognizes Eva
 
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
Castille in support of the bill seeking
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
well seeing no other people signed up to
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
speak uh on House Bill 375 I want to
 
01:21:48.130 --> 01:21:48.140 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a delay till our next one
 
01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
11 o'clock keep in mind we had many more
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
people testifying on these bills last
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
time perhaps it's the weather that's why
 
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
I did give it an hour so uh we'll be
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
back at 11 for host Bill
 
01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:18.410 align:start position:0%
back at 11 for host Bill
597.

01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.420 --> 02:00:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:54.060 align:start position:0%

02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:58.189 align:start position:0%

foreign

02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
02:01:00.239 --> 02:01:01.189 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
committee

02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
I am representative Charlotte dilorenzo
 
02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
I represent Newmarket in new fields in
 
02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house in Rockingham
 
02:01:11.089 --> 02:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
District 10.
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor of this bill I am here
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
to sit in for representative David Muse
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill and I only
 
02:01:21.890 --> 02:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
need probably five to seven minutes to
 
02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:22.790 align:start position:0%
need probably five to seven minutes to
speak

02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
speak
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
I will be brief because I know that
 
02:01:28.250 --> 02:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
representative Muse prepared and sent
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
all of you an email with the testimony
 
02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
now HB 597 would do two things first it
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
would require the Department of Motor
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%
Vehicles to include a person's race and
 
02:01:47.689 --> 02:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
ethnicity on newly issued New Hampshire
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and non-driver's
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
identification cards
 
02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
second it would require law enforcement
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
agencies when possible to collect gender
 
02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:01.860 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity data along with town
 
02:02:04.129 --> 02:02:04.139 align:start position:0%
of residence from a driver's license or
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
other state issued identification card
 
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
when a person is arrested
 
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
cited are subjected to a field stopper
 
02:02:15.189 --> 02:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
warning including a motor vehicle stop
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
that did not lead to a citation
 
02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:20.940 align:start position:0%
the bill also includes an opt-out
 
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
provision that allows someone with
 
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns who doesn't wish to
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
share their racial ethnicity data to opt
 
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
out from sharing it
 
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
as you know this is not the first time
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature has considered these
 
02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:36.649 align:start position:0%
the legislature has considered these
measures

02:02:36.649 --> 02:02:36.659 align:start position:0%
measures
 
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:39.900 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the governor's Commission on law
 
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement accountability community and
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
transparency also known as the LA act
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
commission unanimously recommended a
 
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
series of data collection member
 
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
measures intended to gather data on
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
potential racial profiling by law
 
02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:57.179 align:start position:0%
enforcement in New Hampshire
 
02:02:58.970 --> 02:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
all of the commission's recommendations
 
02:03:02.030 --> 02:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
were endorsed in August of 2020 by
 
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
Governor Christopher sununu among the
 
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
recommendations 23 and 24 both required
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and both are covered under
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
the scope of the bill before you today
 
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
if you're feeling a little bit of
 
02:03:18.649 --> 02:03:18.659 align:start position:0%
legislative Deja Vu today it may be
 
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
because SBC
 
02:03:24.350 --> 02:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
96 an ominous police Reform Bill that
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
was eventually signed into law by the
 
02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
governor started out including these
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
Provisions but prior to the sending the
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
bill over to the house the Senate
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
stripped out these measures in its place
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
a legislative committee was created to
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
study the issue
 
02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
as it turns out the study commission's
 
02:03:46.189 --> 02:03:46.199 align:start position:0%
page and a half report from November of
 
02:03:46.199 --> 02:03:48.229 align:start position:0%
page and a half report from November of
2021

02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
2021
 
02:03:48.239 --> 02:03:49.010 align:start position:0%
2021
um

02:03:49.010 --> 02:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
there were discussions around the pluses
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
and minuses of an opt-out provision that
 
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
were summarized as was the need for the
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
state to pick up any additional cost for
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
system changes
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
which were undetermined at that time and
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
any cost to implement the changes
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
incurred by municipalities
 
02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:09.719 align:start position:0%
the committee recommended one
 
02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
establishing an ad hoc committee to
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
continue working the issue with the
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and two amending a
 
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
referred Bill to create another study
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
committee to continue working the issue
 
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
well another study committee was never
 
02:04:28.010 --> 02:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
apparently created we've learned from
 
02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:30.540 align:start position:0%
the Dos assistant commissioner Eddie
 
02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
Edwards that the department has
 
02:04:34.609 --> 02:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
continued to discuss data collection
 
02:04:37.729 --> 02:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes this is a reason why
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
instead of the cost of the changes being
 
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
classified as indeterminable as they
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
were a few years ago the department was
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
able to estimate the cost of the system
 
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
changes needed to implement the bill at
 
02:04:52.669 --> 02:04:52.679 align:start position:0%
108 thousand dollars
 
02:04:55.490 --> 02:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
while representative the Dos can tell
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
you more about how those costs would
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
break down the bill is an investment in
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
the reputation of our state and if the
 
02:05:04.669 --> 02:05:04.679 align:start position:0%
Specter of racial profiling is ever
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
going to be addressed in any meaningful
 
02:05:06.599 --> 02:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
going to be addressed in any meaningful
way

02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
both the state and the public are going
 
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
to need reliable information on their
 
02:05:14.450 --> 02:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity of the people who are
 
02:05:15.709 --> 02:05:15.719 align:start position:0%
being stopped
 
02:05:19.729 --> 02:05:19.739 align:start position:0%
this that is what HB 597 is all about it
 
02:05:22.370 --> 02:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
offers a simple reliable way to
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
accurately collect prevalent data
 
02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
without asking police officers to guess
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
that is the end of my testimony
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
um if and I'm open to questions thank
 
02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:35.629 align:start position:0%
um if and I'm open to questions thank
you

02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions

02:05:48.649 --> 02:05:48.659 align:start position:0%
maybe I missed it why do we want to
 
02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
collect this data
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
why do you want them to collect the data
 
02:05:55.550 --> 02:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
well to determine whether there is ratio
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
profiling in um traffic stops Etc in New
 
02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:05.030 align:start position:0%
profiling in um traffic stops Etc in New
Hampshire

02:07:03.290 --> 02:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
I'm a law professor at uh UNH School of
 
02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
Law uh I was a public defender for 13
 
02:07:08.750 --> 02:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
years in New Hampshire before I became a
 
02:07:10.850 --> 02:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
law professor 30 years ago
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
I am also a elected Police Commissioner
 
02:07:17.689 --> 02:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth uh what I have to say
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
today is my own opinion it does not
 
02:07:22.669 --> 02:07:22.679 align:start position:0%
reflect the opinion one way or another
 
02:07:25.550 --> 02:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
of unh UNH School of Law or the
 
02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth police commission I want that
 
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
clear and I'm in support of this bill I
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
won't repeat uh representative De
 
02:07:38.089 --> 02:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo said but I think the key here is
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
data collection
 
02:07:42.649 --> 02:07:42.659 align:start position:0%
um I uh you know we've been talking
 
02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
about the issue of racial profiling for
 
02:07:48.109 --> 02:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
a while now both in the legislature and
 
02:07:51.290 --> 02:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
publicly uh particularly uh it was a
 
02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
real this long discussion and important
 
02:07:55.609 --> 02:07:55.619 align:start position:0%
discussion in the liac commission and
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
now some here we'll talk about that uh
 
02:08:01.609 --> 02:08:01.619 align:start position:0%
but the underlying issue is we can talk
 
02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
about it forever but we need data
 
02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
and the court system Prosecutor's
 
02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
offices police departments with some
 
02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:10.990 align:start position:0%
offices police departments with some
exceptions

02:08:10.990 --> 02:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
are not collecting the data so it all
 
02:08:18.530 --> 02:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
turns into talk without data and that's
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
from my perspective in addition to
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
giving people the option of putting race
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
and ethnicity on their on their driver's
 
02:08:27.770 --> 02:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
license uh collecting data so we can
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
sort this out it's really important I
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
will point out that uh there are uh
 
02:08:36.530 --> 02:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
a number of police departments in New
 
02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are Kalia certified and
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
there is a measure of data Rec data
 
02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
collection requirements under Khalia but
 
02:08:50.750 --> 02:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's not comprehensive for example it
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
does not collect ethnicity data it
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
collects only race data
 
02:08:58.490 --> 02:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
the the designation of Hispanic is not a
 
02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
race it's an ethnicity
 
02:09:09.770 --> 02:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
and so uh what I have heard and seen is
 
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
police departments don't know what to do
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
when a person they identify or a person
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
self-identifies as a Hispanic some put
 
02:09:20.930 --> 02:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
it in the category of caucasians some
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
put it in the category of black
 
02:09:27.709 --> 02:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
so even those departments where there's
 
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
not that many in New Hampshire that are
 
02:09:31.250 --> 02:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
clear certified in are collecting some
 
02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:34.619 align:start position:0%
of this data are not collecting uh good
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
data in that regard Portsmouth uh police
 
02:09:39.890 --> 02:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
department which I'm most familiar with
 
02:09:42.649 --> 02:09:42.659 align:start position:0%
is purchasing what's called a new CAD
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
RMS system that is uh the the software
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
system for all the data that they have
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
in the police department and it's a part
 
02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
of that the police commission has has
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
voted uh to adopt some proposals from
 
02:10:00.770 --> 02:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
the community that requires that
 
02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
demographic very specific demographic
 
02:10:06.410 --> 02:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
data be collected and my understanding
 
02:10:08.169 --> 02:10:08.179 align:start position:0%
is it'll be the first police department
 
02:10:11.810 --> 02:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that will more
 
02:10:15.050 --> 02:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
comprehensively collect data and uh
 
02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
and and I I expect that will be helpful
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
but data is everything and I know you
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
know as Representatives you a lot of
 
02:10:25.609 --> 02:10:25.619 align:start position:0%
people coming in front of you with
 
02:10:28.729 --> 02:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
opinions about this about that and my
 
02:10:30.290 --> 02:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
guess is
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
they carry more weight and you make
 
02:10:35.689 --> 02:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
better legislation when you have hard
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
data when you have numbers rather than
 
02:10:41.209 --> 02:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
just who talks the best
 
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
um so I encourage everyone on this
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee to support this bill
 
02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
and more than willing to answer
 
02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:49.689 align:start position:0%
and more than willing to answer
questions

02:10:49.689 --> 02:10:49.699 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's the main question I have about
 
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
this bill so I'll ask you first
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
data is important we use data for
 
02:11:00.530 --> 02:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
everything to make the best judgments we
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
can and that's my concern that the data
 
02:11:05.089 --> 02:11:05.099 align:start position:0%
you're going to be collecting is on an
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
optional basis
 
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
so if it's a small picture of the data
 
02:11:11.570 --> 02:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
because it's optional how can it be
 
02:11:13.149 --> 02:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
considered reliable
 
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.410 --> 02:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
the data we're going to collect in
 
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth about
 
02:11:29.089 --> 02:11:29.099 align:start position:0%
race and ethnicity
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
is the is not just based on driver's
 
02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.209 align:start position:0%
is the is not just based on driver's
license

02:11:35.209 --> 02:11:35.219 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:11:38.570 --> 02:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh it will be based on the perception of
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
the officer remember the issue here
 
02:11:44.089 --> 02:11:44.099 align:start position:0%
is the perception in terms of racial
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
profiling or the risk of racial
 
02:11:49.729 --> 02:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
profiling the issue is how the officer
 
02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
perceives the race or ethnicity of the
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
individual it's that's the most
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
important thing because out of that may
 
02:12:02.209 --> 02:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
emphasis on the word may arise
 
02:12:04.850 --> 02:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
racial profiling
 
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I mean there is evidence out there
 
02:12:13.609 --> 02:12:13.619 align:start position:0%
that uh there's issues uh with that kind
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
of data collection and so the driver's
 
02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:18.020 align:start position:0%
license information
 
02:12:22.609 --> 02:12:22.619 align:start position:0%
helps in part to clear some of that up I
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
know of at least three examples in New
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of individuals who are clearly
 
02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:28.970 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of individuals who are clearly
black

02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
black
 
02:12:32.750 --> 02:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
being stopped and having an encounter
 
02:12:34.010 --> 02:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
with the police
 
02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
and later availability of police reports
 
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
indicates that the police officers put
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
the individual down as Caucasian as
 
02:12:42.719 --> 02:12:43.910 align:start position:0%
the individual down as Caucasian as
white

02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
white
 
02:12:45.890 --> 02:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think that's a rampant
 
02:12:49.609 --> 02:12:49.619 align:start position:0%
problem but the combination of
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
being required to put down your
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
perception of the race or ethnicity of
 
02:12:57.890 --> 02:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
the individual and having a driver's
 
02:13:02.870 --> 02:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
license uh that admittedly optional and
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
we'll see how many people have Avail
 
02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
themselves of that option the
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
combination of those will give us better
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
data data we're not going to have freely
 
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
admit we're never going to get perfect
 
02:13:17.569 --> 02:13:17.579 align:start position:0%
data but we got no data right now
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
02:13:28.729 --> 02:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:30.649 --> 02:13:30.659 align:start position:0%

02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
hi again
 
02:13:43.790 --> 02:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
um Edward Castillo I live in Manchester
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
like I said before I am an activist and
 
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm an immigrant rights Advocate but
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
also I work a lot with the police in
 
02:13:54.050 --> 02:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
addition to being a police commissioner
 
02:13:56.510 --> 02:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
in Manchester I'm not speaking on behalf
 
02:14:00.109 --> 02:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
of the Communist police cognition so
 
02:14:02.209 --> 02:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
um I was the chair of the
 
02:14:04.490 --> 02:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
disproportional minority contact
 
02:14:08.089 --> 02:14:08.099 align:start position:0%

02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:10.910 align:start position:0%
state Advisory Group for Juvenile
Justice

02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
when it existed about 10 years ago for a
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
few years and it was a nightmare
 
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
to to get data we did not have enough
 
02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:21.649 align:start position:0%
to to get data we did not have enough
data

02:14:21.649 --> 02:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:14:25.850 --> 02:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
so I really feel it is needed to
 
02:14:29.810 --> 02:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
prove that our police departments really
 
02:14:32.209 --> 02:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
in the last few years have really made
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
an effort
 
02:14:35.169 --> 02:14:35.179 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:14:38.330 --> 02:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
unbiased we all have bias as all of us
 
02:14:40.729 --> 02:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
but building relationships and part of
 
02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:42.599 align:start position:0%
my role is to build relationships and I
 
02:14:44.569 --> 02:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
have gone all over the state talking to
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
all kinds of police departments just to
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
to build relationships with them and to
 
02:14:53.089 --> 02:14:53.099 align:start position:0%
and for it has been a two-way education
 
02:14:56.209 --> 02:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
process me educated myself about police
 
02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
issues but at the same time educating
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
them about the particular issues that we
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
immigrants face uh I like the idea of
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
ethnicity because I am not a I'm married
 
02:15:10.129 --> 02:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
on the surface uh you would see me as a
 
02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
white person but I'm a Latina person and
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
I don't identify myself as white and I
 
02:15:17.450 --> 02:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
would never put myself white I just
 
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
leave that question blank or I put order
 
02:15:24.589 --> 02:15:24.599 align:start position:0%
and I put human but I don't I don't
 
02:15:28.189 --> 02:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
identify that I never really liked the
 
02:15:32.510 --> 02:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
fact that we had to be asked about race
 
02:15:34.669 --> 02:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
in a country where race is supposed to
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
not be an issue anywhere in anything but
 
02:15:40.910 --> 02:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
at the same time the more I worked with
 
02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
so many in so many venues the more I see
 
02:15:48.229 --> 02:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
the purpose of it and this is it to just
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're collecting making
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
sure that we're treating everybody
 
02:15:56.089 --> 02:15:56.099 align:start position:0%
equally and and I change my position and
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes it is voluntary but at the same time
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
we all have to play a role in the
 
02:16:03.290 --> 02:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
community to explain to all the
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
communities why is this question needed
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of the Dominicans are Latinos but
 
02:16:13.490 --> 02:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
they are black in race and they would
 
02:16:15.290 --> 02:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
never put themselves as black they have
 
02:16:17.870 --> 02:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
they put themselves as Latinos so
 
02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
ethnicity is also very important and I
 
02:16:23.810 --> 02:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
am in full support of this because we do
 
02:16:26.149 --> 02:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
have great police departments here and
 
02:16:28.550 --> 02:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
we they trying to do the right thing
 
02:16:30.890 --> 02:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
they're individuals in every single
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
group that have their biases but I'm
 
02:16:36.410 --> 02:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
sure that uh
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
with with this data we're gonna see a
 
02:16:41.570 --> 02:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
lot of the good stuff that is happening
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
in our communities thank you
 
02:16:48.049 --> 02:16:48.059 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh next up
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try this again uh in
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
support of the bill representing the
 
02:17:10.690 --> 02:17:10.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:01.969 --> 02:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.950 --> 02:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me sir did you have a card filled
 
02:18:05.389 --> 02:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
out too
 
02:18:07.490 --> 02:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
I'm here just to find additional
 
02:18:09.410 --> 02:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
testimony as another thing to install
 
02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
you well if you're going to provide some
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
testimony I do need you to fill out one
 
02:18:13.610 --> 02:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
of these for me I'm happy to have been
 
02:18:15.049 --> 02:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
my amend that with adding my name after
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Cheryl
 
02:18:25.370 --> 02:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
good morning members my name is Joseph
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
viscaz and I will be representing the
 
02:18:30.169 --> 02:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
ACLU of New Hampshire in support of HB
 
02:18:32.990 --> 02:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
597 I will also be representing various
 
02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
criminal justice stakeholders in New
 
02:18:36.770 --> 02:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in support of this
 
02:18:39.530 --> 02:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
this recommendation was something that
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
was born out of a concern that came
 
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
during the liac commission which I
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
served on Governor sununu appointed this
 
02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
commission to take a look at New
 
02:18:49.129 --> 02:18:49.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law enforcement and look for
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
ways of improving it uh in New Hampshire
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
as we spent many months on this uh
 
02:18:59.690 --> 02:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
commission and analyzing different parts
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
this this recommendation came forward
 
02:19:05.929 --> 02:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
uh due to a couple things that involved
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
concerns over individuals who felt that
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
they were being profiled and when the
 
02:19:12.889 --> 02:19:12.899 align:start position:0%
data was trying to be researched it was
 
02:19:15.410 --> 02:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
not complete it was inconclusive and it
 
02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
led to gaps um in in certain assessments
 
02:19:19.969 --> 02:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
of the system
 
02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
this concern was brought to the state
 
02:19:24.049 --> 02:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
police who did take uh steps to to
 
02:19:25.730 --> 02:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
ensure that where they started doing
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
data collection neighbors is a federal
 
02:19:32.509 --> 02:19:32.519 align:start position:0%
uh based uh system that requires uh this
 
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
type of data collection and so they have
 
02:19:36.169 --> 02:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
it publicly available on their website
 
02:19:39.169 --> 02:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
only 154 departments though are
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
reporting to this system and again this
 
02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
is an issue when you are trying to
 
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
analyze the system as a whole and you're
 
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
looking for ways of improving it
 
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
so ensuring this passing this
 
02:19:51.290 --> 02:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
legislation would be more than just
 
02:19:53.810 --> 02:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
about uh racial profiling and data
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
collection it would be about analyzing
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
the system as a whole and looking for
 
02:19:58.910 --> 02:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
ways that we could improve it in New
 
02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:00.530 align:start position:0%
ways that we could improve it in New
Hampshire

02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
there has been concerns that have been
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
brought to the ACLU I've uh you heard
 
02:20:05.150 --> 02:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
testimony earliest today about
 
02:20:07.490 --> 02:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
individuals who uh clearly were not the
 
02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
demographic that they were identified or
 
02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:10.859 align:start position:0%
labeled as I was one of those
 
02:20:10.859 --> 02:20:12.410 align:start position:0%
labeled as I was one of those
individuals

02:20:12.410 --> 02:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me in 2021 I was followed for
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
over a mile
 
02:20:20.389 --> 02:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
um by an officer who pulled me over
 
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
right as I was crossing into the next
 
02:20:25.969 --> 02:20:25.979 align:start position:0%
County uh into the next uh Town Line uh
 
02:20:28.790 --> 02:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
and after after a long discussion with
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
this officer on the side of the road
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
where it was apparent that um
 
02:20:36.770 --> 02:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
I was being just uh fished for as I was
 
02:20:39.770 --> 02:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
on my way to work I was let go and I
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
went on my way when I did a 91a request
 
02:20:44.690 --> 02:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
on that stop because I felt that the
 
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
stop was not
 
02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:47.270 align:start position:0%
stop was not
um

02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
to the standard of what it should have
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
been I was put down as a Caucasian male
 
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know uh
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
how I was identified that way or not but
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
I think that that that raised some
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
concerns and then we started to see that
 
02:21:03.410 --> 02:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
that also had been happening in other uh
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
parts of the state this is also
 
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
happening nationally and I can submit
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
some information on that after the
 
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee is interested in that as well
 
02:21:13.130 --> 02:21:13.140 align:start position:0%
so this was all brought up and this
 
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation came forward to try to
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
address those concerns this was
 
02:21:19.610 --> 02:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
unanimously agreed upon by both the
 
02:21:21.490 --> 02:21:21.500 align:start position:0%
community and the law enforcement
 
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
Community as well so to have both of
 
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
them together and not have this
 
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
legislation passed is very shocking I am
 
02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
02:21:32.570 --> 02:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
may have on this
 
02:21:35.210 --> 02:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir any questions
 
02:21:36.889 --> 02:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair
 
02:21:41.990 --> 02:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
with with
 
02:21:45.950 --> 02:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
what's going on today and our age is
 
02:21:49.550 --> 02:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
I can I can identify as
 
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
a black person and have that on my
 
02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:54.830 align:start position:0%
a black person and have that on my
license

02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
license
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
and and I I just don't understand I'm
 
02:21:59.630 --> 02:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
how will that help data collection
 
02:22:07.130 --> 02:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
02:22:09.650 --> 02:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
So currently uh what is considered the
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
gold standard in New Hampshire is Kalia
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
it is an accreditation system that
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
police departments use and they all
 
02:22:19.250 --> 02:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
strive to go for this standard
 
02:22:22.370 --> 02:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
Kalia requires this type of data
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
collection in their standards and there
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
has there was even talks about moving
 
02:22:28.969 --> 02:22:28.979 align:start position:0%
towards a more uniformed measure across
 
02:22:30.590 --> 02:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
the state that all departments would
 
02:22:33.050 --> 02:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
operate under that same standard even if
 
02:22:35.690 --> 02:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
they couldn't be Khalia accredited due
 
02:22:37.330 --> 02:22:37.340 align:start position:0%
to either Financial
 
02:22:40.429 --> 02:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
restrictions or signs of departments
 
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
having this data what it does is it
 
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
allows you to look at the system as a
 
02:22:46.429 --> 02:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
whole and while you I know when you said
 
02:22:48.590 --> 02:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if you were referencing
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
yourself specifically as identifying as
 
02:22:53.330 --> 02:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
by if you were if you were to do that
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
um at the department of safety I think
 
02:22:54.720 --> 02:22:56.030 align:start position:0%
um at the department of safety I think
that

02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
that would there there would be a
 
02:23:00.770 --> 02:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
violation for that because those those
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
when you are at the way that the system
 
02:23:04.130 --> 02:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
would work is that an individual when
 
02:23:06.590 --> 02:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
they would go to get their license
 
02:23:08.690 --> 02:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
um at time of renewal or when they were
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
originally there would be a a code that
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
would have it it wouldn't be something
 
02:23:14.150 --> 02:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
that would actually be printed on your
 
02:23:16.250 --> 02:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
license and it could Auto populate when
 
02:23:19.670 --> 02:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
the officer went to their vehicle to um
 
02:23:22.730 --> 02:23:22.740 align:start position:0%
scan the the license onto their system
 
02:23:24.650 --> 02:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
if a person is going to the Department
 
02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
of Safety and misidentifying themself on
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
official documents I can't speak to this
 
02:23:31.849 --> 02:23:31.859 align:start position:0%
I think that the Attorney General's
 
02:23:32.809 --> 02:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
office here and department of safety
 
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
that could be but I think that that
 
02:23:35.809 --> 02:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
would actually be a violation because
 
02:23:38.270 --> 02:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
you're you would not be allowed to
 
02:23:41.030 --> 02:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
um to lie on on on your documents that
 
02:23:42.290 --> 02:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
you're submitting to the Department of
 
02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
Safety again this is about looking at
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
multiple things this is about looking at
 
02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:48.660 align:start position:0%
Trends patterns statistics it's also
 
02:23:50.809 --> 02:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
about ensuring how is the system working
 
02:23:52.849 --> 02:23:52.859 align:start position:0%
in each area and how can we bring it up
 
02:23:54.530 --> 02:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
if you see it in one area of New
 
02:23:55.849 --> 02:23:55.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that things are going well
 
02:23:57.050 --> 02:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
then other departments can share
 
02:23:59.090 --> 02:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
information on work this is a this is
 
02:24:01.490 --> 02:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
not to to form a system to have a odd
 
02:24:03.469 --> 02:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
got you here a moment that is not what
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is about this is about a tool this
 
02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
committee makes decisions based on data
 
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
and facts they do not make decisions off
 
02:24:12.469 --> 02:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
the top of their head and so
 
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's what this is this is about adding
 
02:24:17.330 --> 02:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
tools to our system of analysis to be
 
02:24:19.250 --> 02:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
able to ensure that we have an equitable
 
02:24:23.150 --> 02:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:25.370 --> 02:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
any other questions follow-up
 
02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:28.809 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
um

02:24:28.809 --> 02:24:28.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
do you have data today on New Hampshire
 
02:24:37.130 --> 02:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
police departments that seems to be an
 
02:24:39.770 --> 02:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
issue that's why you want this on the
 
02:24:41.210 --> 02:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
driver's license
 
02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:44.510 align:start position:0%
driver's license
oh

02:24:44.510 --> 02:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
seems to be an issue in which what do
 
02:24:49.490 --> 02:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
you mean by seems to be an issue if I
 
02:24:52.790 --> 02:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
may ask so I want to know what data what
 
02:24:54.410 --> 02:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
data you actually have is do you have
 
02:24:56.690 --> 02:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
any data that there are any problems
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
with police departments in New Hampshire
 
02:24:58.439 --> 02:25:00.110 align:start position:0%
with police departments in New Hampshire
uh

02:25:00.110 --> 02:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
doing inappropriate identification of
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
people besides here and there and what
 
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
might have happened already
 
02:25:10.250 --> 02:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
like to yourself and
 
02:25:13.250 --> 02:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh I would consider the Lori list
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
um public data on whether or not that
 
02:25:26.770 --> 02:25:26.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
 
02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like there are two parts
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's the part where the officer
 
02:25:39.889 --> 02:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
reports their impression
 
02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
of the ethnicity of the race but it's
 
02:25:44.690 --> 02:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
also self-reported by the person on
 
02:25:47.150 --> 02:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
their license or in their database in in
 
02:25:49.370 --> 02:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
their data so if the two things don't
 
02:25:51.170 --> 02:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
match it would there would be some kind
 
02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
of trigger to
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
dig a Little Deeper as to why the it was
 
02:25:58.670 --> 02:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
misreported or you know maybe just
 
02:26:00.290 --> 02:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
didn't fill his paperwork right and
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
checked the wrong box or something like
 
02:26:02.690 --> 02:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
that so it would give you kind of a
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
Fail-Safe to
 
02:26:06.770 --> 02:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
to say is that kind of why there's two
 
02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
parts to it with the
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great question
 
02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative so I think that it
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's there is two parts to that so
 
02:26:16.730 --> 02:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
the the first part is that uh this
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
information is required of the officer
 
02:26:20.690 --> 02:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
and so when you when you think of a
 
02:26:22.730 --> 02:26:22.740 align:start position:0%
situation of an officer pulling us and
 
02:26:24.410 --> 02:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
it's we can all I don't know if we can
 
02:26:26.330 --> 02:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
all relate to it but you get pulled over
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
by an officer that's already
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
um a little bit of a contentious
 
02:26:30.889 --> 02:26:30.899 align:start position:0%
situation you don't know why you're
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
being pulled over and so it's it's not
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
it was seen as a concern to it's not
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
fair for an officer to have to then ask
 
02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
an individual while they're playing hey
 
02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
by the way uh what do you identify as
 
02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
too like that could just lead to you
 
02:26:46.730 --> 02:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
know or further exacerbate this the
 
02:26:49.070 --> 02:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
situation so putting the onus on the
 
02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
individual and not requiring it this is
 
02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're not going to require
 
02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
an individual to have to identify if
 
02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
they don't want to it's optional but for
 
02:27:00.050 --> 02:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
those that would and and will it will
 
02:27:02.210 --> 02:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
help the system
 
02:27:06.349 --> 02:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
um and you wouldn't know about in in to
 
02:27:08.630 --> 02:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
your point the Fail-Safe until an
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
individual wanted to then make a request
 
02:27:13.309 --> 02:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
so if everything was going fine then the
 
02:27:14.570 --> 02:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
information would just get entered and
 
02:27:17.389 --> 02:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
it would go according to how it went and
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
it would be audited by the department
 
02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
periodically uh when they do their
 
02:27:22.670 --> 02:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
audits but if the individual who was
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
part of an interaction with law
 
02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement felt in some type of way
 
02:27:28.670 --> 02:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
that hey this interaction was not the
 
02:27:31.130 --> 02:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
way that I feel it should have gone in
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
sense of you know how I feel uh treated
 
02:27:35.630 --> 02:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
and respected they could then request
 
02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
that information publicly which is
 
02:27:39.530 --> 02:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
allowed by law and then that information
 
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be there to accompany and then
 
02:27:45.349 --> 02:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
could lead to research and Analysis
 
02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
02:27:48.300 --> 02:27:49.370 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
so

02:27:49.370 --> 02:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that there is no data
 
02:27:53.450 --> 02:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
right now you can't tell
 
02:27:53.460 --> 02:27:55.070 align:start position:0%
right now you can't tell
whether

02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:27:57.170 --> 02:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
if there's no ethnicity data or racial
 
02:28:00.050 --> 02:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
data on the license in the database you
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
don't know that
 
02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:02.450 align:start position:0%
don't know that
um

02:28:02.450 --> 02:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
their racer ethnicity was misreported
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
as part of a traffic stop you don't know
 
02:28:10.429 --> 02:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
if that was intentional to try to
 
02:28:13.130 --> 02:28:13.140 align:start position:0%
avoid any kind of conflicts or to show
 
02:28:16.730 --> 02:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
any kind of racial profiling because you
 
02:28:18.410 --> 02:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
don't have the data it doesn't exist so
 
02:28:20.210 --> 02:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
in order to to create that and to show
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
whether things are going really well or
 
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know there is some profiling or
 
02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
where the problems are that's why you
 
02:28:27.770 --> 02:28:27.780 align:start position:0%
need this
 
02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:30.050 align:start position:0%
need this
actually

02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:28:32.330 --> 02:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
another question I'm just I'm trying to
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
get to the question is that why you need
 
02:28:35.570 --> 02:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
this extra piece
 
02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:36.950 align:start position:0%
this extra piece
uh

02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:40.490 --> 02:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
so if I understand correctly this this
 
02:28:43.429 --> 02:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
in this data collection is necessary to
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that we it's not currently in
 
02:28:48.530 --> 02:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
entirety the state police are doing a
 
02:28:50.389 --> 02:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
great job right now on putting this out
 
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
there but it's not uniform across the
 
02:28:53.929 --> 02:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
state you have other departments you
 
02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
have uh the Hollis Police Department
 
02:28:57.469 --> 02:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
other Kalia departments that have data
 
02:28:59.330 --> 02:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
but not all police departments which
 
02:29:01.130 --> 02:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
then leads to issues when you're trying
 
02:29:04.309 --> 02:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
to analyze the system so having this
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
requirement would then make that data
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
available publicly to everyone and
 
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
because federally it's already being
 
02:29:15.050 --> 02:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.450 --> 02:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
02:29:19.130 --> 02:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
I I just want to make sure I understand
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
the attempt the purpose of this bill is
 
02:29:28.190 --> 02:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
to improve upon data collection
 
02:29:31.490 --> 02:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
and make it more universally collected
 
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
because not all communities are doing so
 
02:29:35.889 --> 02:29:35.899 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
02:29:38.570 --> 02:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
that is part of the con that is part of
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of this yes correct and one
 
02:29:42.349 --> 02:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
more follow-up if I may yeah follow it
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
and I just I thought I heard you say
 
02:29:45.359 --> 02:29:47.150 align:start position:0%
and I just I thought I heard you say
earlier

02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:29:49.969 --> 02:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
that the federal government now requires
 
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
this but it's not happening everywhere
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire did I mishear that
 
02:29:55.849 --> 02:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
because I don't honestly don't have my
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
hearing aids in today so I want to make
 
02:30:00.290 --> 02:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
sure I heard that right so so nybers is
 
02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:01.859 align:start position:0%
a system it's the national
 
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
um the national incident uh
 
02:30:06.950 --> 02:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
I forgot what the H's reporting system
 
02:30:09.590 --> 02:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it uh I'll have to
 
02:30:12.410 --> 02:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
look at what the H is it collects data
 
02:30:14.650 --> 02:30:14.660 align:start position:0%
uh that is reported by the state police
 
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
involving crime statistics in New
 
02:30:16.920 --> 02:30:17.809 align:start position:0%
involving crime statistics in New
Hampshire

02:30:17.809 --> 02:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
part of the demographics uh that is
 
02:30:23.690 --> 02:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
collected is uh race and ethnicity and
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
if this is but that is what they're
 
02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
required to do now the state police will
 
02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:29.090 align:start position:0%
required to do now the state police will
then

02:30:29.090 --> 02:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
go uh ask the local departments to
 
02:30:34.730 --> 02:30:34.740 align:start position:0%
report that data to them right not all
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
departments are doing it and that is
 
02:30:40.389 --> 02:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:40.399 --> 02:30:42.290 align:start position:0%
 
Rumbo

02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
Rumbo
 
02:30:43.969 --> 02:30:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
um did I understand correctly sorry if
 
02:30:49.490 --> 02:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
you need a moment um that it would be
 
02:30:51.530 --> 02:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
the race and ethnicity information will
 
02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
be recorded as a as a code number or
 
02:30:56.150 --> 02:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
something along those as opposed to
 
02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
term did I hear someone say that on
 
02:30:59.630 --> 02:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
license or would just be
 
02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
listed as a race or ethnicity would it
 
02:31:05.090 --> 02:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
be numerical code yeah so I I don't I
 
02:31:07.370 --> 02:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
don't think that we would I I wouldn't I
 
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't Envision something that just
 
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
says black on you know my license uh to
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
identify as that uh or you know but yeah
 
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
it would be an alphanumeric
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
um system that would be kept at the
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
division of motor vehicles and then that
 
02:31:21.889 --> 02:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
would be internal code and then one when
 
02:31:23.809 --> 02:31:23.819 align:start position:0%
an officer would have a license it would
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
just Auto populate on the report of
 
02:31:27.650 --> 02:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
their interaction okay I guess I was
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if an officer pulls you over
 
02:31:30.770 --> 02:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
and asks your license and looks at your
 
02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
license he or she
 
02:31:34.910 --> 02:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
see the alphanumeric code
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
and perhaps be able to more accurately
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
reflect in their report also as opposed
 
02:31:41.809 --> 02:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
to perhaps a misunderstanding or you
 
02:31:43.610 --> 02:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
know misapprehension
 
02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
um correct in addition to the Fail-Safe
 
02:31:46.429 --> 02:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about a double
 
02:31:49.490 --> 02:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
checking later oh correct and and in
 
02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
actuality most officers probably won't
 
02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
even know what that alphanumeric code
 
02:31:54.410 --> 02:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
stands for what they if they you know
 
02:31:56.150 --> 02:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
identify list because it wouldn't just
 
02:31:58.910 --> 02:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
be limited to the certain things um we
 
02:32:00.530 --> 02:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
heard earlier for Eva Costello about
 
02:32:02.630 --> 02:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
ethnicity and ethnicities there's uh
 
02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
nuances to them so having
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
um a flushed out system would would be
 
02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:08.690 align:start position:0%
um a flushed out system would would be
helpful

02:32:08.690 --> 02:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
02:32:11.090 --> 02:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay keep in mind this is the ACLU we
 
02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
have other people speaking that may be
 
02:32:19.070 --> 02:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
better for the technical aspects of the
 
02:32:21.830 --> 02:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill by all means representative thank
 
02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:22.790 align:start position:0%
bill by all means representative thank
you

02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
02:32:28.130 --> 02:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
I'm a new legislator and I am not um
 
02:32:30.650 --> 02:32:30.660 align:start position:0%
familiar with react
 
02:32:33.050 --> 02:32:33.060 align:start position:0%
um I knew that it existed
 
02:32:36.770 --> 02:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
um but um could you briefly characterize
 
02:32:39.889 --> 02:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
the type of testimony that led to the
 
02:32:41.929 --> 02:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
conclusions arrived at by the report
 
02:32:44.570 --> 02:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
that this kind of data collection was
 
02:32:46.610 --> 02:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
necessary did you have public testimony
 
02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:52.190 --> 02:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
do I have a public testimony by the liac
 
02:32:52.200 --> 02:32:55.490 align:start position:0%
do I have a public testimony by the liac
commission

02:32:55.490 --> 02:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:59.630 --> 02:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
um information gathering part of
 
02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
Gathering part of the um of the
 
02:33:04.849 --> 02:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
commission's work did you have public
 
02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
testimony from people that led you to
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
believe that this type of data
 
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
collection was necessary yes yes we did
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's all that answered
 
02:33:16.010 --> 02:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
that question required so any other
 
02:33:18.290 --> 02:33:18.300 align:start position:0%

president of New Hampshire Chiefs many
 
02:34:35.690 --> 02:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
many years ago however and uh just as an
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
aside at one time was a member of the
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
House a regulated Revenue Committee in
 
02:34:40.080 --> 02:34:44.809 align:start position:0%
House a regulated Revenue Committee in
1995-96

02:34:44.809 --> 02:34:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.819 --> 02:34:45.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:48.590 --> 02:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
so I I join you here this morning in
 
02:34:52.429 --> 02:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
support of host pill 597. I did want to
 
02:34:55.309 --> 02:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
just uh make some comments and and maybe
 
02:34:58.309 --> 02:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
some recommendations uh but I'll I'll
 
02:35:00.050 --> 02:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
first start with a little bit of a his
 
02:35:03.050 --> 02:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh history with my involvement
 
02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
um obviously this recommendation was uh
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
the basis or one of the recommendations
 
02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
from the liac Commission
 
02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
in the uh immediate aftermath of the
 
02:35:16.370 --> 02:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
liac recommendations I was involved with
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
the legislative work group that worked
 
02:35:21.170 --> 02:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
on this very Bill and I've testified
 
02:35:23.090 --> 02:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
that on this and on a number of
 
02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
occasions and my my goal has always been
 
02:35:29.330 --> 02:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
to inform legislators and stakeholders
 
02:35:31.610 --> 02:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
about some of the realities that we deal
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
with in terms of uh data collection in
 
02:35:37.250 --> 02:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
specifically uh police records
 
02:35:39.469 --> 02:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
Management Systems
 
02:35:42.349 --> 02:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
um I I'm a chief of an accredited agency
 
02:35:46.790 --> 02:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
so uh we are required to provide a
 
02:35:48.730 --> 02:35:48.740 align:start position:0%
review of
 
02:35:51.290 --> 02:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
bias-based policing to identify any
 
02:35:53.090 --> 02:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
negative Trends and if there are
 
02:35:55.010 --> 02:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
negative Trends to make the appropriate
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
modifications and corrections but I will
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
tell you that in terms of Records
 
02:36:01.690 --> 02:36:01.700 align:start position:0%
Management systems
 
02:36:05.389 --> 02:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
that I would hope that all agencies in
 
02:36:08.270 --> 02:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
the state utilize electronic records
 
02:36:10.250 --> 02:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
Management Systems used there are
 
02:36:12.349 --> 02:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
varying levels of ability in terms of
 
02:36:15.950 --> 02:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
extrapolating data and then using that
 
02:36:18.590 --> 02:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
data to generate these reports and these
 
02:36:22.309 --> 02:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
reviews so that it's reliable and it
 
02:36:24.650 --> 02:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
provides the reviewer with valuable
 
02:36:27.050 --> 02:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
information on how the police are doing
 
02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of biospace policing
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh there's also naturally a very uh
 
02:36:33.770 --> 02:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
there's a financial cost to these
 
02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:35.270 align:start position:0%
there's a financial cost to these
efforts

02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so I I do think we need to be mindful
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
of that in terms of the legislation
 
02:36:42.349 --> 02:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
aside from what's indicated for the
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
modifications to the DMV vision system
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
um I would also ask if if you look at uh
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
line eight on page one
 
02:36:54.349 --> 02:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
um you know when I look at legislation
 
02:36:56.809 --> 02:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
as a chief I oftentimes ask myself what
 
02:36:58.429 --> 02:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
is the usefulness
 
02:37:01.849 --> 02:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
uh and certainly ask that question in
 
02:37:03.770 --> 02:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
terms of motor vehicle accident and
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
fatality information
 
02:37:06.479 --> 02:37:07.010 align:start position:0%
fatality information
um

02:37:07.010 --> 02:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:09.770 --> 02:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the intent or
 
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
usefulness of that specific data point
 
02:37:15.710 --> 02:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
is from my understanding I think that
 
02:37:17.570 --> 02:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
might be a new addition from previous
 
02:37:19.510 --> 02:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
versions of the bill I could be wrong
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm just curious uh as to what the
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
intent is there for and and again I ask
 
02:37:27.410 --> 02:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
myself the questions of usefulness
 
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
because I do believe it adds a layer of
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
complexity uh to a process of data
 
02:37:37.010 --> 02:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
collection that is already very complex
 
02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:37.610 align:start position:0%
collection that is already very complex
um

02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:39.770 --> 02:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
I would also be remiss and I mentioned
 
02:37:42.170 --> 02:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
it before that I work for an accredited
 
02:37:44.450 --> 02:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
agency I'm lucky
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and that that's a national accredited
 
02:37:50.929 --> 02:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
accrediting body independent body and
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
there are specific standards uh
 
02:37:58.610 --> 02:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
two data collection or the provision of
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
review of data as it relates to
 
02:38:03.650 --> 02:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
demographics and such I won't get into
 
02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:05.819 align:start position:0%
the specific standard numbers but I have
 
02:38:08.170 --> 02:38:08.180 align:start position:0%
some testimony that I'll hand out
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
that has those standards attached to it
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
additionally as you may or may not be
 
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
aware New Hampshire has created uh just
 
02:38:20.090 --> 02:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
most recently a state accreditation
 
02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
program and I can tell you because I'm
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
on the commission that there will be a
 
02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
standard relative to biospace review and
 
02:38:30.830 --> 02:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:33.469 --> 02:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
um lastly there's recommendations that
 
02:38:37.130 --> 02:38:37.140 align:start position:0%
are in draft form from the Department of
 
02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
Justice in terms of accreditation
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
standards in what independent
 
02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
accrediting bodies should look for and
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
this also is an additional component of
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
that as well and it names uh
 
02:38:52.190 --> 02:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
specifically detention such as stops
 
02:38:55.490 --> 02:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
frisks searches summonses and arrests
 
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
I just wanna
 
02:38:59.690 --> 02:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
reiterate the fact that in order for
 
02:39:01.790 --> 02:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
this information to be useful it has to
 
02:39:04.250 --> 02:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
be collected into standardized and
 
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
systematic manner there are states
 
02:39:08.270 --> 02:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
around us who do that and I can think of
 
02:39:10.610 --> 02:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
Vermont and they have struggled since
 
02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
its Inception uh with the statute to
 
02:39:17.150 --> 02:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
collect this data in a reliable
 
02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
standardized systematic way
 
02:39:23.570 --> 02:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
um so it's not just setting up a system
 
02:39:27.770 --> 02:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's about having a good system in place
 
02:39:32.090 --> 02:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
because data without uh a reliable means
 
02:39:34.130 --> 02:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
to collect it and populate
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
is not going to be reliable it's just
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
data that isn't sufficiently supported
 
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm no mathematician or scientist
 
02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:43.130 align:start position:0%
and I'm no mathematician or scientist
but

02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:39:45.469 --> 02:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
um that's that's not an accepted way to
 
02:39:46.849 --> 02:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
do business
 
02:39:46.859 --> 02:39:48.650 align:start position:0%
do business
so

02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:50.210 --> 02:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
um those are my thoughts I'd be happy to
 
02:39:51.349 --> 02:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I Know Chief
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
Reynolds has uh some commentary as well
 
02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
yep bullet Chief Reynolds go first and
 
02:39:58.250 --> 02:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
we'll open it up to questions thank you
 
02:40:00.050 --> 02:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chair
 
02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:00.650 align:start position:0%
well thank you Mr chair
um

02:40:00.650 --> 02:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:04.010 --> 02:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
my interest uh in this comes from the
 
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
past several years I've been involved
 
02:40:09.410 --> 02:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
with uh federal court audit monitoring
 
02:40:11.150 --> 02:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
of police departments
 
02:40:13.250 --> 02:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
dealing with civil rights
 
02:40:14.929 --> 02:40:14.939 align:start position:0%
which has included the review and
 
02:40:17.270 --> 02:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
Analysis of data relating to police
 
02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:18.710 align:start position:0%
Analysis of data relating to police
interactions

02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
interactions
 
02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
for example one of the cities that I
 
02:40:23.270 --> 02:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
worked with my duties were to analyze
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand stops on an annual basis
 
02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
so get an Insight on the data that's
 
02:40:31.849 --> 02:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
needed to do that effectively
 
02:40:34.610 --> 02:40:34.620 align:start position:0%
first a couple of points first in order
 
02:40:37.849 --> 02:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
for demographic data to be of value it
 
02:40:40.490 --> 02:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
must be accurate therefore absent the
 
02:40:42.349 --> 02:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the requested demographic
 
02:40:45.530 --> 02:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
data on individuals driver's license or
 
02:40:48.590 --> 02:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
other recognized identification
 
02:40:51.349 --> 02:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
the recording of such data relies on two
 
02:40:53.690 --> 02:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
things first asking for the information
 
02:40:56.510 --> 02:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
by the officer or
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
recording his or her perception of the
 
02:41:01.309 --> 02:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
person's race gender or other
 
02:41:04.130 --> 02:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
demographic data neither of which are
 
02:41:06.050 --> 02:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
recommended practices
 
02:41:08.270 --> 02:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
decisions must also be made regarding
 
02:41:10.670 --> 02:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
the identification of Pop various
 
02:41:14.809 --> 02:41:14.819 align:start position:0%
populations groups both race and ethnic
 
02:41:16.969 --> 02:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
will our identification be consistent
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
with the OMB directive 17 or within New
 
02:41:21.359 --> 02:41:22.150 align:start position:0%
with the OMB directive 17 or within New
Hampshire

02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:41:25.790 --> 02:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
census population data questions that
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
need to be answered moreover in addition
 
02:41:29.630 --> 02:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
to collection of Motor Vehicles stop
 
02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:31.130 align:start position:0%
to collection of Motor Vehicles stop
data

02:41:31.130 --> 02:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:41:34.010 --> 02:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
suggested in this bill a meaningful
 
02:41:35.809 --> 02:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
analysis of data relating to the
 
02:41:35.819 --> 02:41:36.950 align:start position:0%
analysis of data relating to the
interaction

02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
the interaction between the officer and
 
02:41:40.969 --> 02:41:40.979 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
02:41:42.889 --> 02:41:42.899 align:start position:0%
should include whether or not there was
 
02:41:44.990 --> 02:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
a search whether the Search is with or
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
without the consent whether or not
 
02:41:49.610 --> 02:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
Contraband was seized or not these are
 
02:41:52.370 --> 02:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
all important data Concepts if we want
 
02:41:55.250 --> 02:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
to understand whether or not this was a
 
02:41:58.010 --> 02:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
legitimate police interaction or was it
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
racially biased
 
02:42:03.770 --> 02:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
the point is for this effort we need to
 
02:42:05.690 --> 02:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
have a comprehensive meaningful and
 
02:42:07.790 --> 02:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
thoughtful process
 
02:42:09.770 --> 02:42:09.780 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agencies in New
 
02:42:11.929 --> 02:42:11.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire particularly the smaller ones
 
02:42:14.210 --> 02:42:14.220 align:start position:0%
which are comprise some majority as you
 
02:42:16.250 --> 02:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
know do not presently have the
 
02:42:18.650 --> 02:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
analytical capacity to do so
 
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
nor are they likely to locally acquire
 
02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
the result the funds to purchase or
 
02:42:25.790 --> 02:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
modify their Data Systems
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to accomplish the
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive data collection effort so
 
02:42:33.290 --> 02:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
clearly this will require an investment
 
02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
in data analysis capability for our
 
02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
various law enforcement agencies and
 
02:42:41.389 --> 02:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
therefore the 108 000 fiscal note on
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:42:44.990 --> 02:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
appears to be inadequate
 
02:42:47.389 --> 02:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
finally I just make this comment
 
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
I frequently seize news see news
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
accounts reporting on police encounters
 
02:42:53.389 --> 02:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
alleging the police are
 
02:42:55.630 --> 02:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
disproportionately interacting with
 
02:42:58.730 --> 02:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
specified minority communities and note
 
02:43:01.130 --> 02:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
that while the data the data presented
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
on its face is accurate
 
02:43:06.050 --> 02:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
it really portrays an inaccurate
 
02:43:08.770 --> 02:43:08.780 align:start position:0%
activity on part of the police to expect
 
02:43:11.690 --> 02:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
interactions between the police and each
 
02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
specific race ethnic agenda will be
 
02:43:17.929 --> 02:43:17.939 align:start position:0%
proportional to census data is simply
 
02:43:21.050 --> 02:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
unrealistic accordingly a thoughtful and
 
02:43:24.429 --> 02:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
thorough approach is required in perhaps
 
02:43:27.290 --> 02:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
this leads us to that
 
02:43:30.889 --> 02:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
and with that I I hope you will give
 
02:43:33.410 --> 02:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
this bill some serious consideration and
 
02:43:35.150 --> 02:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
be pleased to answer any questions you
 
02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
may have
 
02:43:38.270 --> 02:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:40.010 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
question I guess this is kind of to both
 
02:43:46.490 --> 02:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
of you
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
let's say that this bill was placed in
 
02:43:51.469 --> 02:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
was placed uh was passed
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
how often would you be reviewing this
 
02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:59.030 align:start position:0%
how often would you be reviewing this
data

02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:02.570 align:start position:0%
 
sure

02:44:02.570 --> 02:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:02.580 --> 02:44:04.730 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:44:04.730 --> 02:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:07.010 --> 02:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
I think at least annually I think we're
 
02:44:09.050 --> 02:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
required to do that annually and provide
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
a review of of the data
 
02:44:13.849 --> 02:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
um I think that's probably the best
 
02:44:14.990 --> 02:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
answer I can give you I don't know
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
Charlie if you have any additional
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
commentaries sir well in some of the
 
02:44:21.650 --> 02:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
places where I work at are a significant
 
02:44:24.110 --> 02:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
size but what we would do is look at the
 
02:44:26.270 --> 02:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
data on a monthly basis to try to
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
determine if there were some trends of
 
02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
concerns so we didn't wait until the end
 
02:44:32.210 --> 02:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
of the year to decide if we had to do
 
02:44:34.670 --> 02:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
some interaction but if we look if it
 
02:44:37.070 --> 02:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
looked like there was some aberration in
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
the data we would be able to drill down
 
02:44:41.650 --> 02:44:41.660 align:start position:0%
and and determine whether or not it was
 
02:44:45.050 --> 02:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
profiling or incorrect activities on the
 
02:44:46.370 --> 02:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
plot of police and take corrective
 
02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:47.389 align:start position:0%
plot of police and take corrective
action

02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up thank you Mr
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
02:44:54.530 --> 02:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
let's say that you took a look at this
 
02:44:57.650 --> 02:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
and you saw some trends
 
02:45:02.210 --> 02:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
do you talk to the entire force or do
 
02:45:06.590 --> 02:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
you go down to a police officer or two
 
02:45:09.889 --> 02:45:09.899 align:start position:0%
in regards to trends that you're seeing
 
02:45:12.050 --> 02:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
02:45:14.510 --> 02:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
that varies a little bit the agencies I
 
02:45:16.010 --> 02:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
worked in were
 
02:45:19.309 --> 02:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
had significant data and and when we saw
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
an aberration we would uh take that we
 
02:45:25.490 --> 02:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
were able to take that right down to the
 
02:45:27.650 --> 02:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
supervisor in the squad
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
and the individual officer to determine
 
02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh there was some issues
 
02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
of concern for instance one time we had
 
02:45:38.630 --> 02:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
just tell you the story one time we had
 
02:45:40.429 --> 02:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
a concern it seemed like there was a
 
02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
spike in interactions with Asians
 
02:45:45.590 --> 02:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
so we tracked that down and we found out
 
02:45:48.650 --> 02:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
the squad that was responsible for that
 
02:45:51.469 --> 02:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
was actually a sign to work Asian gangs
 
02:45:53.929 --> 02:45:53.939 align:start position:0%
so you know we were able to identify
 
02:45:56.270 --> 02:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
quickly why that Spike was there there
 
02:45:58.370 --> 02:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
are other examples but that that was
 
02:45:59.690 --> 02:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
always one that
 
02:46:02.150 --> 02:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
sort of amazed us when we got there so
 
02:46:05.929 --> 02:46:05.939 align:start position:0%
this was explainable but in a smaller
 
02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
scale uh I think Chief ovecki can bet
 
02:46:11.570 --> 02:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
her answer better answer that but that
 
02:46:11.580 --> 02:46:13.010 align:start position:0%
her answer better answer that but that
data

02:46:13.010 --> 02:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:46:14.330 --> 02:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
when you look at it you see those
 
02:46:16.730 --> 02:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
aberrations pretty quickly if it's if
 
02:46:22.010 --> 02:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:24.290 --> 02:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative Coker
 
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so just uh out of
 
02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
curiosity do you have like a round
 
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
number that it would cost to upgrade the
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
data infrastructure for like a small
 
02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:34.130 align:start position:0%
data infrastructure for like a small
normal

02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
normal
 
02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
02:46:37.370 --> 02:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
um give you an idea our records
 
02:46:39.170 --> 02:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
management system
 
02:46:42.770 --> 02:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
we have 18 officers 21 employees
 
02:46:48.170 --> 02:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
it costs 16 to 17 000 a year and uh
 
02:46:51.050 --> 02:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
annually you can factor in and increase
 
02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
roughly five to seven percent each year
 
02:46:57.290 --> 02:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
um that's one feature included within
 
02:46:59.570 --> 02:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
the software
 
02:46:59.580 --> 02:47:00.530 align:start position:0%
the software
um

02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know in and then you have the issue
 
02:47:05.929 --> 02:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
of the data you know extracting the data
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
in a format that's that's easy to
 
02:47:11.450 --> 02:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
interpret and then populate into a
 
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
review I know our records management uh
 
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
system IMC which is quite common in the
 
02:47:19.429 --> 02:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
state many agencies use it you can run a
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
data point one way and then run it at
 
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
you know what you think is the same way
 
02:47:25.849 --> 02:47:25.859 align:start position:0%
and get two different data points
 
02:47:27.650 --> 02:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
and and so you have to be very careful
 
02:47:30.410 --> 02:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
with the data you you're you're trying
 
02:47:32.210 --> 02:47:32.220 align:start position:0%
to run and analyze because you want to
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
make sure it's accurate as accurate as
 
02:47:35.389 --> 02:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
you can be
 
02:47:35.399 --> 02:47:36.469 align:start position:0%
you can be
um

02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
Oh by answering your question follow-up
 
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
so another question I had is um for the
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh Kayla certification
 
02:47:46.730 --> 02:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
um the information you gather on that
 
02:47:48.590 --> 02:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
the demographic information is that
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
based you can get certification just
 
02:47:53.450 --> 02:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
based on the officer's perception or how
 
02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
does that you are you familiar with how
 
02:47:59.929 --> 02:47:59.939 align:start position:0%
that works I am excuse me I am let me
 
02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
read the standard applicable standard
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's consistent between both the
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
national and state programs and it says
 
02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
a documented annual administrative
 
02:48:10.250 --> 02:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
review of agency practices including
 
02:48:12.770 --> 02:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
citizen concerns and any corrective
 
02:48:14.809 --> 02:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
measures and then it talks about within
 
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
the commentary
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
um reviewing uh this this data for our
 
02:48:24.170 --> 02:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
officers it's based on their perception
 
02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to require an officer to
 
02:48:29.750 --> 02:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
ask on a motor vehicle stop or roadside
 
02:48:31.490 --> 02:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
how a person
 
02:48:34.130 --> 02:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
you know what race or ethnicity I don't
 
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
think that's appropriate and the last
 
02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
thing we want to do is cause further
 
02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
divisions within communities of colors
 
02:48:41.929 --> 02:48:41.939 align:start position:0%
because we're asking these questions
 
02:48:44.510 --> 02:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's not it's just not good practice and
 
02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:46.740 align:start position:0%
many of the stakeholders that are
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
sitting behind us agree to that it's
 
02:48:50.929 --> 02:48:50.939 align:start position:0%
just it's not the right way to do
 
02:48:50.939 --> 02:48:52.610 align:start position:0%
just it's not the right way to do
business

02:48:52.610 --> 02:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:48:54.889 --> 02:48:54.899 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate it and just a
 
02:48:54.899 --> 02:48:55.790 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate it and just a
follow-up

02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:48:57.710 --> 02:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
um some of the previous testimony
 
02:48:59.090 --> 02:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
indicates that
 
02:49:02.990 --> 02:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
the demographics were misrepresented on
 
02:49:05.090 --> 02:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
reports and when you leave that to the
 
02:49:08.090 --> 02:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
office's perception oftentimes that can
 
02:49:10.130 --> 02:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
occur because let's face it there are a
 
02:49:12.110 --> 02:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
lot of people at a mixed race a lot of
 
02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
people that can be mistaken for one or
 
02:49:14.530 --> 02:49:14.540 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:49:17.809 --> 02:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
they can be a lot of errors and then to
 
02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
leave it to accuse the officer of making
 
02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:22.309 align:start position:0%
leave it to accuse the officer of making
uh

02:49:22.309 --> 02:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:30.050 --> 02:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing no other questions
 
02:49:31.969 --> 02:49:31.979 align:start position:0%
thank you both very much thank you Mr
 
02:49:31.979 --> 02:49:36.349 align:start position:0%

02:49:36.359 --> 02:49:58.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:49:58.849 --> 02:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh we have two more people signed
 
02:50:04.670 --> 02:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
up to testify they're both asking for
 
02:50:05.870 --> 02:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
02:50:08.570 --> 02:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's perfect timing so I'm going to
 
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
hold you to the five minutes uh next up
 
02:50:13.790 --> 02:50:13.800 align:start position:0%

02:51:17.389 --> 02:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
we spent much time
 
02:51:22.309 --> 02:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:25.429 --> 02:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
I wholeheartedly support this bill
 
02:51:27.170 --> 02:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
you've already heard
 
02:51:30.050 --> 02:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
that this bill originated as a result of
 
02:51:31.969 --> 02:51:31.979 align:start position:0%
many many discussions
 
02:51:35.150 --> 02:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
with Lee act and hearings which the
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
governor gave us two months
 
02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
to take testimony and to come up with
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
the 38 recommendations that we came up
 
02:51:50.210 --> 02:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:52.490 --> 02:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
many of the concerns about this bill
 
02:51:54.650 --> 02:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
some mentioned here
 
02:51:56.690 --> 02:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
have been raised by law enforcement and
 
02:51:59.090 --> 02:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
we took the time to listen to those
 
02:52:02.929 --> 02:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
concerns and craft legislation which we
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
all agreed addressed those concerns
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
so I would hope that you would trust the
 
02:52:12.530 --> 02:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
logic of this bill that it is sound
 
02:52:14.510 --> 02:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
and that the reasons not to collect
 
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
racial data both logical reasons and
 
02:52:22.309 --> 02:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:24.889 --> 02:52:24.899 align:start position:0%
I Rise before you to highlight
 
02:52:27.290 --> 02:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is a lack of trust
 
02:52:29.330 --> 02:52:29.340 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
and the criminal justice system
 
02:52:34.670 --> 02:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
which we feel having this data will help
 
02:52:39.130 --> 02:52:39.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
NAACP polling suggests that 87 percent
 
02:52:44.690 --> 02:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
of black adults say that the U.S
 
02:52:46.370 --> 02:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system
 
02:52:49.610 --> 02:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
is more unjust toward black people
 
02:52:54.769 --> 02:52:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
lest you think those statistics are not
 
02:52:58.910 --> 02:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
relevant to New Hampshire
 
02:53:00.769 --> 02:53:00.779 align:start position:0%
research from the sentencing project
 
02:53:03.170 --> 02:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
shows that New Hampshire has a black
 
02:53:05.450 --> 02:53:05.460 align:start position:0%
white imprisonment disparity ratio of
 
02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
5.2 to 1.
 
02:53:13.130 --> 02:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:15.170 --> 02:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
it's been suggested
 
02:53:17.570 --> 02:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
that collecting this data is akin to
 
02:53:19.910 --> 02:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
racial profiling
 
02:53:22.370 --> 02:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
I would suggest to you that this is a
 
02:53:23.990 --> 02:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
specious argument
 
02:53:26.570 --> 02:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
first racial profiling happens when an
 
02:53:28.849 --> 02:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
officer is in the field before someone
 
02:53:31.550 --> 02:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
is pulled over not when data is being
 
02:53:31.560 --> 02:53:33.290 align:start position:0%
is pulled over not when data is being
collected

02:53:33.290 --> 02:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
collected
 
02:53:36.530 --> 02:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
second we people of color would be the
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
first to make the claim that the bill

constituted racial profiling if we
 
02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
thought it was
 
02:53:44.389 --> 02:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
and we have not

changed but nothing that nothing can be

changed until it is faced we have
 
02:54:00.290 --> 02:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
steadfastly asked for the collection of
 
02:54:01.910 --> 02:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
this data
 
02:54:04.190 --> 02:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
in recognition that the collection is
 
02:54:07.130 --> 02:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
critical in facing racial profiling and

Department of Justice and I'm here today
 
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Attorney General John from
 
02:55:50.269 --> 02:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
Ella who apologizes that he couldn't be
 
02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
here today but we support this bill this
 
02:55:54.590 --> 02:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
is with that I don't want to be
 
02:55:57.889 --> 02:55:57.899 align:start position:0%
repetitive so this is a product of the
 
02:56:00.050 --> 02:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
leeact commission recommendation this
 
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
bill has been substantially in the same
 
02:56:04.550 --> 02:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
form before the legislature and then
 
02:56:06.889 --> 02:56:06.899 align:start position:0%
before a study committee for the better
 
02:56:09.050 --> 02:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
part of two and a half years at this
 
02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:10.250 align:start position:0%
part of two and a half years at this
point

02:56:10.250 --> 02:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
um it does reflect what at the time was
 
02:56:15.769 --> 02:56:15.779 align:start position:0%
a consensus between Community
 
02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
stakeholders police unions police Chiefs
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
our office members from the community as
 
02:56:21.359 --> 02:56:22.150 align:start position:0%
our office members from the community as
well

02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:56:25.730 --> 02:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
and uh and and I do understand that it
 
02:56:28.090 --> 02:56:28.100 align:start position:0%
was sent to study for some concerns
 
02:56:30.830 --> 02:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
but nobody has come forward with any
 
02:56:32.450 --> 02:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
sort of alternative Vision so here we
 
02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
are and we do support the bill I did
 
02:56:37.490 --> 02:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
want to walk you through just the
 
02:56:41.690 --> 02:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
general there's three broad Strokes in
 
02:56:43.910 --> 02:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
terms of what this build does the first
 
02:56:47.090 --> 02:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
section of the bill exempts certain data
 
02:56:49.790 --> 02:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
from the driver privacy act as you know
 
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's a default rule that any data
 
02:56:55.370 --> 02:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
collected on a you know in the course of
 
02:56:58.490 --> 02:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh Motor Vehicle Record including data
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's on a driver's license is
 
02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
generally exempt from public disclosure
 
02:57:05.990 --> 02:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
this first section creates an exemption
 
02:57:07.330 --> 02:57:07.340 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
the the second broad stroke are sections
 
02:57:15.290 --> 02:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
two three four five six and seven and
 
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
eight which amend the various types of
 
02:57:19.610 --> 02:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
licenses there are three types of
 
02:57:22.730 --> 02:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
non-drivers IDs one just a regular run
 
02:57:25.969 --> 02:57:25.979 align:start position:0%
of the mill driver ID than a real ID and
 
02:57:29.809 --> 02:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
then the Enhanced Driver's ID which
 
02:57:31.969 --> 02:57:31.979 align:start position:0%
also provides for proof of citizenship
 
02:57:34.190 --> 02:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
as you all know and then this it does
 
02:57:36.170 --> 02:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
the same thing for driver's licenses and
 
02:57:38.809 --> 02:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's licenses the third
 
02:57:42.769 --> 02:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
section is section nine which uh is in a
 
02:57:45.110 --> 02:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
new statute that's immediately placed
 
02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
after a current statute which requires
 
02:57:48.849 --> 02:57:48.859 align:start position:0%
certain information
 
02:57:52.730 --> 02:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh to be in a arrest record including
 
02:57:55.130 --> 02:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
the identity of the person that's being
 
02:57:57.650 --> 02:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
arrested the way we view this is that
 
02:58:01.870 --> 02:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
this is no different than a pre-existing
 
02:58:05.150 --> 02:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
law that it just acts to clarify what
 
02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
that pre-existing law that requires
 
02:58:09.050 --> 02:58:09.060 align:start position:0%
information to be contained in the
 
02:58:11.870 --> 02:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:13.910 --> 02:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
and it was said before and it Bears
 
02:58:15.469 --> 02:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
emphasizing now
 
02:58:18.349 --> 02:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
um all that's needed is a scan of a
 
02:58:20.210 --> 02:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
license in order to pre-populate this
 
02:58:22.730 --> 02:58:22.740 align:start position:0%
data and what this does would uh by
 
02:58:26.630 --> 02:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
adding ethnicity and and race to as one
 
02:58:28.190 --> 02:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
of the data points that's collected
 
02:58:30.410 --> 02:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
albeit optional
 
02:58:33.290 --> 02:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
um that it would also be pre-populated
 
02:58:35.870 --> 02:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
once the an officer pulls somebody over
 
02:58:37.730 --> 02:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
brings the license and registration
 
02:58:40.610 --> 02:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
backs back to their Cruiser scans the
 
02:58:42.769 --> 02:58:42.779 align:start position:0%
license just like it pre-populates right
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
now in the majority of jurisdictions
 
02:58:47.269 --> 02:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
both local and all of State Police it
 
02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
pre-populates their their name
 
02:58:52.190 --> 02:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
address and other information that's
 
02:58:54.530 --> 02:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
contained on the driver's license and it
 
02:58:56.389 --> 02:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
would also Auto populate race and
 
02:59:00.530 --> 02:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
ethnicity in that respect uh so it it
 
02:59:02.929 --> 02:59:02.939 align:start position:0%
does eliminate uh the testimony before
 
02:59:04.790 --> 02:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
the layout commission was that officers
 
02:59:07.730 --> 02:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
uh reasonably are uncomfortable making
 
02:59:11.750 --> 02:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
judgment calls right now there is in our
 
02:59:15.830 --> 02:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's a non-mandatory field as part of
 
02:59:18.230 --> 02:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
the neighbors National incident based
 
02:59:20.530 --> 02:59:20.540 align:start position:0%
Reporting System that's a federal system
 
02:59:23.269 --> 02:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh or it's a it's a it's a state system
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
that reports to the federal government
 
02:59:27.550 --> 02:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
through a U.S doj Grant
 
02:59:30.230 --> 02:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
which we do participate in in State
 
02:59:32.349 --> 02:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
Police administers
 
02:59:35.870 --> 02:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
that that information is contained in
 
02:59:38.990 --> 02:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
some of those uh incident-based arrests
 
02:59:41.870 --> 02:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
what happens under current law is that
 
02:59:44.469 --> 02:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
it's since it's a non-mandatory field
 
02:59:47.090 --> 02:59:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's sparsely populated sometimes
 
02:59:48.590 --> 02:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
they're filled out sometimes they're not
 
02:59:50.450 --> 02:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
even Within State Police it's
 
02:59:54.050 --> 02:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
inconsistent from a uh from that
 
02:59:57.110 --> 02:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
perspective so what this does is it
 
03:00:00.349 --> 03:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
enables those communities who were to be
 
03:00:03.290 --> 03:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh you know who would like to seek Kalia
 
03:00:05.570 --> 03:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
certification which is as others had
 
03:00:08.030 --> 03:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
said that gold standard it allows a
 
03:00:11.809 --> 03:00:11.819 align:start position:0%
better source of data
 
03:00:11.819 --> 03:00:14.210 align:start position:0%
better source of data
the

03:00:14.210 --> 03:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:00:16.130 --> 03:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
um I I will leave it at that and I'm
 
03:00:18.650 --> 03:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions we do
 
03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
strongly support and urge the committee
 
03:00:23.170 --> 03:00:23.180 align:start position:0%
to pass the bill as written
 
03:00:25.929 --> 03:00:25.939 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions
 
03:00:28.130 --> 03:00:28.140 align:start position:0%

chairman do you have any data from the
 
03:00:36.349 --> 03:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
states where uh where it's optional like
 
03:00:38.570 --> 03:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
that have a similar Bill like what the
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
opt-out rate is I don't okay I don't and
 
03:00:42.950 --> 03:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know that the committee took
 
03:00:42.960 --> 03:00:44.330 align:start position:0%
I don't know that the committee took
testimony

03:00:44.330 --> 03:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:00:46.490 --> 03:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
um to do to to that effect the
 
03:00:48.650 --> 03:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
commission the governor's commission
 
03:00:50.090 --> 03:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
um so I'm sorry I don't have to answer
 
03:00:52.370 --> 03:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you
 
03:00:54.590 --> 03:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
I just got one question and to summarize
 
03:00:56.990 --> 03:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
I or hopefully I understood what you
 
03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:58.070 align:start position:0%
I or hopefully I understood what you
said

03:00:58.070 --> 03:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:00:58.080 --> 03:00:59.150 align:start position:0%
said
you

03:00:59.150 --> 03:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:01:02.269 --> 03:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
do you believe that the option which
 
03:01:04.010 --> 03:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
basically this whole bill is consisting
 
03:01:04.020 --> 03:01:04.910 align:start position:0%
basically this whole bill is consisting
of

03:01:04.910 --> 03:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
is probably not perfect but it's the
 
03:01:08.150 --> 03:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
best thing we could come up with and
 
03:01:09.170 --> 03:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
nobody else could come up with anything
 
03:01:10.670 --> 03:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
better is that what you said we're
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:01:18.469 --> 03:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:01:18.479 --> 03:01:21.050 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

03:01:21.050 --> 03:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:23.269 --> 03:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh next up chair recognizes major Joseph
 
03:01:25.790 --> 03:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
Ebert from the state police uh not
 
03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:27.769 align:start position:0%
Ebert from the state police uh not
taking

03:01:27.769 --> 03:01:27.779 align:start position:0%
taking
 
03:01:30.170 --> 03:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
I guess not taking a position on the
 
03:01:31.490 --> 03:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
bill at this point looking for three
 
03:01:31.500 --> 03:01:32.990 align:start position:0%
bill at this point looking for three
minutes

03:01:32.990 --> 03:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
03:01:37.010 --> 03:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon now good afternoon uh I
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
am Joseph Ebert it's eb-e-r-t I am a
 
03:01:41.210 --> 03:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
major with the state police I oversee
 
03:01:42.889 --> 03:01:42.899 align:start position:0%
the Investigative Services Bureau which
 
03:01:45.290 --> 03:01:45.300 align:start position:0%
is your state police detectives I'm also
 
03:01:46.969 --> 03:01:46.979 align:start position:0%
very aware that my testimony May stand
 
03:01:48.889 --> 03:01:48.899 align:start position:0%
between you and lunch so I will keep
 
03:01:51.650 --> 03:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
this very brief uh
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
I guess I one of the things I noticed
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
when reading the uh this year's version
 
03:02:00.050 --> 03:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
of this legislation is there is the
 
03:02:04.010 --> 03:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the ZIP code or identifying
 
03:02:05.630 --> 03:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
where the individual is from New
 
03:02:07.250 --> 03:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is somewhat a transitory State
 
03:02:08.990 --> 03:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
and by that I mean there are lots of
 
03:02:10.969 --> 03:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
people who are stopped on our roadways
 
03:02:12.710 --> 03:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
who are interactive with law enforcement
 
03:02:14.870 --> 03:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
who come from outside of the State of
 
03:02:17.570 --> 03:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I think it's uh that
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
portion uh that addition to this bill
 
03:02:21.889 --> 03:02:21.899 align:start position:0%
was very important however I noticed in
 
03:02:24.110 --> 03:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh the back portion of this
 
03:02:27.530 --> 03:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
which is uh page three where it talks
 
03:02:30.290 --> 03:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
about the aggregate data that shall be
 
03:02:32.990 --> 03:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
reported uh if the bill were to go
 
03:02:35.389 --> 03:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
forward I would like to see on behalf of
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
the State Police we'd like to see the
 
03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
the ZIP code inclusion in there as well
 
03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
as data that shall be reported uh police
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
I I will not uh uh bemoan the uh the
 
03:02:49.070 --> 03:02:49.080 align:start position:0%
fact that I think has already been uh
 
03:02:51.429 --> 03:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
addressed which is if if you put
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
inaccurate data into a system you can
 
03:02:56.030 --> 03:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
expect that inaccurate data comes out of
 
03:02:59.090 --> 03:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
it uh what I will say though is that
 
03:03:02.690 --> 03:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
um we are certainly uh uh well aware of
 
03:03:06.170 --> 03:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
the need for accurate data what that has
 
03:03:08.269 --> 03:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
at least in previous iterations of the
 
03:03:10.070 --> 03:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill would that has been referred to as
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
how do you credential a person's race or
 
03:03:15.349 --> 03:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
ethnicity I I don't know and I don't sit
 
03:03:17.870 --> 03:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
before you uh and pretend to know the
 
03:03:19.790 --> 03:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
answer to that question
 
03:03:22.490 --> 03:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
um we are absolutely as an organization
 
03:03:24.650 --> 03:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
the state police is absolutely in uh
 
03:03:26.889 --> 03:03:26.899 align:start position:0%
support of the Lee act recommendations
 
03:03:29.330 --> 03:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
and that's not a throwaway line we are
 
03:03:31.010 --> 03:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
truly in support of that and we want to
 
03:03:32.750 --> 03:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
grow our relationships with all
 
03:03:35.090 --> 03:03:35.100 align:start position:0%
communities within the state we also
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we do not cause
 
03:03:41.150 --> 03:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
divides by producing inaccurate data and
 
03:03:44.690 --> 03:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
by that I mean it it will analyzing data
 
03:03:47.269 --> 03:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
where somebody is not required on the
 
03:03:49.309 --> 03:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
front end everyone required to be in one
 
03:03:52.929 --> 03:03:52.939 align:start position:0%
subset would allow for
 
03:03:56.269 --> 03:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
data to be output never knowing or never
 
03:03:57.950 --> 03:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
being able to understand how many people
 
03:04:00.889 --> 03:04:00.899 align:start position:0%
opted out of the ability to add their
 
03:04:04.190 --> 03:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
race to their driver's license
 
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
I think there's an ancillary issue that
 
03:04:08.210 --> 03:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
may uh occur that's kind of unique to
 
03:04:10.969 --> 03:04:10.979 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in that what what happens
 
03:04:13.610 --> 03:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
and this was uh brought up in a previous
 
03:04:14.990 --> 03:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
testimony but what happens when an
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
individual comes into the DMV is clearly
 
03:04:20.090 --> 03:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh an African-American or clearly a
 
03:04:23.210 --> 03:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
Caucasian and puts on their form the
 
03:04:26.750 --> 03:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
opposite uh that's compounded further by
 
03:04:28.370 --> 03:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
the fact that in New Hampshire you can
 
03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
put X as a gender
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
so you now have somebody who could put
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
x's agender and identify inappropriately
 
03:04:39.170 --> 03:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
as their uh as their race this is
 
03:04:41.690 --> 03:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
further compounded uh when you look at
 
03:04:43.550 --> 03:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
the notion that you can have your photo
 
03:04:46.190 --> 03:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
expunged from the DMV system by request
 
03:04:48.830 --> 03:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
so I I just I bring that uh to your
 
03:04:51.110 --> 03:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
attention because I think it's uh as an
 
03:04:53.090 --> 03:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
end user or at some point in my career I
 
03:04:54.530 --> 03:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
was an end user of somebody sitting on
 
03:04:55.730 --> 03:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
the side of the road trying to identify
 
03:04:58.370 --> 03:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
an individual it becomes markedly more
 
03:05:00.410 --> 03:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
difficult when the data that you're
 
03:05:02.750 --> 03:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
provided is not consistent and not
 
03:05:06.170 --> 03:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
required for everyone across the board
 
03:05:06.180 --> 03:05:06.769 align:start position:0%
required for everyone across the board
um

03:05:06.769 --> 03:05:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:08.750 --> 03:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think the the last thing I would leave
 
03:05:11.870 --> 03:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
you with is that uh we are keenly aware
 
03:05:14.570 --> 03:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh of the perceptions by certain
 
03:05:16.910 --> 03:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
communities within our state and we want
 
03:05:19.370 --> 03:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
to work to improve any of those uh that
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a positive review of law
 
03:05:20.880 --> 03:05:21.889 align:start position:0%
don't have a positive review of law
enforcement

03:05:21.889 --> 03:05:21.899 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:05:23.809 --> 03:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
I'd also put forward to you that I think
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
there is a concern on the part of law
 
03:05:28.490 --> 03:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
enforcement that data that is inaccurate
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
would be posted to a website and made
 
03:05:33.530 --> 03:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
public and judgments would be made on
 
03:05:35.929 --> 03:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
the part of the public that may be
 
03:05:38.450 --> 03:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
incongruent with fact in other words
 
03:05:41.150 --> 03:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
somebody May read the data and not dig
 
03:05:43.010 --> 03:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
in enough to know that there isn't the
 
03:05:45.230 --> 03:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
option to opt out they may not dig in
 
03:05:48.170 --> 03:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
enough to know and understand the data
 
03:05:49.790 --> 03:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
that is being presented to them and that
 
03:05:52.490 --> 03:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
may cause a divide so we are certainly
 
03:05:55.670 --> 03:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
in favor of the concept of this law we
 
03:05:57.769 --> 03:05:57.779 align:start position:0%
just have current concerns with the
 
03:06:00.349 --> 03:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
current stat status of it and how it
 
03:06:03.230 --> 03:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
came to be so I I hope I address that I
 
03:06:05.510 --> 03:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
hope I address uh that in a coherent
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
manner if I haven't I'm available for
 
03:06:08.809 --> 03:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
any questions and I thank the committee
 
03:06:11.870 --> 03:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
very much for the time this morning
 
03:06:13.610 --> 03:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:06:16.910 --> 03:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
um any questions from the committee
 
03:06:18.650 --> 03:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you again thank you
 
03:06:22.190 --> 03:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:25.130 --> 03:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
director marasco from the New Hampshire
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles no position
 
03:06:38.090 --> 03:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:39.769 --> 03:06:39.779 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
03:06:42.050 --> 03:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
03:06:43.790 --> 03:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
um if this bill were to pass I just
 
03:06:45.410 --> 03:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know that from a DMV
 
03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint this is something that we
 
03:06:49.790 --> 03:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
would be able to implement uh with
 
03:06:51.650 --> 03:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
regards to uh from a cost standpoint
 
03:06:53.690 --> 03:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
there was a previous LSR that was
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
generated for I believe a previous bill
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
that was around a hundred thousand
 
03:07:00.110 --> 03:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
dollars and it appears as though it
 
03:07:01.969 --> 03:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
would still come in at that same uh
 
03:07:04.490 --> 03:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
General threshold so from a cost
 
03:07:06.590 --> 03:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint we could we would find a way
 
03:07:09.769 --> 03:07:09.779 align:start position:0%
to make it work and um as far as if it
 
03:07:11.389 --> 03:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
did go on the credential itself there is
 
03:07:13.610 --> 03:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
an enva international standard on the
 
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
amount of information that can be on a
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
driver's license but if we're talking
 
03:07:20.290 --> 03:07:20.300 align:start position:0%
about a number or some small indicator
 
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
we can find a way to do that so I just
 
03:07:25.010 --> 03:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
want to share that thank you
 
03:07:26.750 --> 03:07:26.760 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman

although briefly
 
04:03:40.070 --> 04:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
for those of you who don't know me my
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
name is Laura talerski I represent
 
04:03:44.330 --> 04:03:44.340 align:start position:0%
nashua's War date which is Hillsborough
 
04:03:46.969 --> 04:03:46.979 align:start position:0%
11 and I served my last two terms here
 
04:03:52.130 --> 04:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
today I'm here to present House Bill 650
 
04:03:57.530 --> 04:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
FN relative to prohibiting suspension of
 
04:04:00.050 --> 04:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses due to non-payment of
 
04:04:01.490 --> 04:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
fines or fees
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
house Transportation has seen this bill
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
before but for the newer members I'll
 
04:04:07.969 --> 04:04:07.979 align:start position:0%
start by setting up this simple scenario
 
04:04:10.250 --> 04:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
a person finds themselves in a situation
 
04:04:11.929 --> 04:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
where they have a fine and for whatever
 
04:04:14.450 --> 04:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
reason times may be tough they are a
 
04:04:16.130 --> 04:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
hard-working parent trying to keep their
 
04:04:18.410 --> 04:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
family going or it's someone trying to
 
04:04:20.450 --> 04:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
get on their feet whatever the situation
 
04:04:22.189 --> 04:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
could be they just can't pull together
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
the extra money the court then says okay
 
04:04:26.689 --> 04:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
you haven't paid you're fine we're going
 
04:04:28.250 --> 04:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
to have to punish you now by taking away
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
your driver's license so now our person
 
04:04:32.269 --> 04:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
who's barely getting by and trying to
 
04:04:34.370 --> 04:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
make ends meet has no transportation to
 
04:04:35.990 --> 04:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
get to work where they may actually
 
04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
stand a chance of earning the money they
 
04:04:39.769 --> 04:04:39.779 align:start position:0%
need to pay back the fine or fee in the
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
first place there's now a downward
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
spiral with a compounding problem that
 
04:04:46.490 --> 04:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
puts this person even further behind and
 
04:04:48.650 --> 04:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
unable to get on their feet let's say
 
04:04:50.330 --> 04:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
they somehow find a way to earn the
 
04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
money to pay their fee even though they
 
04:04:54.170 --> 04:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
have no way to get to work and now they
 
04:04:56.330 --> 04:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
can get their license reinstated but
 
04:04:58.370 --> 04:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
guess what there's yet another fee to
 
04:05:00.170 --> 04:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
get their license back
 
04:05:02.750 --> 04:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
debt related driving restrictions can
 
04:05:04.849 --> 04:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
cost people their livelihoods leaving
 
04:05:06.650 --> 04:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
them unable to get to work and be
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
positive contributors to society
 
04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
licensed suspension for non-payment of
 
04:05:13.150 --> 04:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
fines fees or restitution
 
04:05:16.250 --> 04:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
disproportionately punishes the poor
 
04:05:17.570 --> 04:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
this bill has been through house
 
04:05:19.370 --> 04:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
Transportation twice in recent history
 
04:05:23.450 --> 04:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
in 2020 House Bill 1667 was a bipartisan
 
04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
Bill sponsored by representative David
 
04:05:27.490 --> 04:05:27.500 align:start position:0%
Welch that was viewed as overly broad
 
04:05:30.530 --> 04:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
this committee worked together to amend
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
the bill very similar to the draft that
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
you have before you today and it passed
 
04:05:36.349 --> 04:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
this committee 20 to nothing and was put
 
04:05:39.530 --> 04:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar before dying due
 
04:05:40.550 --> 04:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
to covid
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
in 2021 it was filed again as House Bill
 
04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
435 and was retained by this committee
 
04:05:48.769 --> 04:05:48.779 align:start position:0%
there were some last minute concerns
 
04:05:50.330 --> 04:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
that came up and in the end we passed a
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
version that would remove the director's
 
04:05:54.290 --> 04:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
ability to suspend a license due to
 
04:05:55.849 --> 04:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
moral turpitude which was signed into
 
04:05:55.859 --> 04:05:56.809 align:start position:0%
moral turpitude which was signed into
law

04:05:56.809 --> 04:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
so once again here we are back to try
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
and Tackle prohibition of licenses
 
04:06:03.050 --> 04:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
suspensions for non-payment of fines
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
fees and restitution I want to be clear
 
04:06:07.250 --> 04:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
that taking away a license should be
 
04:06:09.410 --> 04:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
used when there is a direct threat to
 
04:06:11.389 --> 04:06:11.399 align:start position:0%
Public Safety on the roads but
 
04:06:13.250 --> 04:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
suspending a license for non-payment of
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
fines can very simply make it harder for
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
people to pay it doesn't push them to
 
04:06:20.090 --> 04:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
pay if they can't pay in the first place
 
04:06:22.490 --> 04:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
another scenario two people receive
 
04:06:24.410 --> 04:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
speeding tickets with fines and fees one
 
04:06:26.570 --> 04:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
pays and continues driving no change in
 
04:06:28.610 --> 04:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
their behavior the other can't afford to
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
pay and their license is suspended the
 
04:06:33.469 --> 04:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
suspension is solely about money it's
 
04:06:34.969 --> 04:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
not about public safety and the rich
 
04:06:37.370 --> 04:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
person can continues to drive with a
 
04:06:38.809 --> 04:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
different punishment than the poor
 
04:06:38.819 --> 04:06:39.530 align:start position:0%
different punishment than the poor
person

04:06:39.530 --> 04:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:06:41.929 --> 04:06:41.939 align:start position:0%
dealing with the courts police or the
 
04:06:44.330 --> 04:06:44.340 align:start position:0%
DMV successfully should not be different
 
04:06:46.969 --> 04:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
for the poor and the rich
 
04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
everyone here knows that New Hampshire
 
04:06:50.809 --> 04:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
is quite Rural and lacks adequate public
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
transportation options leaving a person
 
04:06:54.530 --> 04:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
with few choices when needing to get to
 
04:06:57.410 --> 04:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
work buy food get kids to school or
 
04:07:00.769 --> 04:07:00.779 align:start position:0%
Access Health Care with few options a
 
04:07:03.410 --> 04:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
person may risk driving with a suspended
 
04:07:05.510 --> 04:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
license opening themselves up to even
 
04:07:07.849 --> 04:07:07.859 align:start position:0%
more complicated legal issues if they're
 
04:07:10.250 --> 04:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
stopped it's like a snowball that keeps
 
04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
getting bigger because they are poor and
 
04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
desperate to work and provide for their
 
04:07:13.439 --> 04:07:14.689 align:start position:0%
desperate to work and provide for their
family

04:07:14.689 --> 04:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
a few quick things about the bill in
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
front of you on line 10 part B
 
04:07:22.849 --> 04:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
this carves out the exception that a
 
04:07:24.769 --> 04:07:24.779 align:start position:0%
license can be suspended for failure to
 
04:07:26.450 --> 04:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
pay child support
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
this was brought up the first time we
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
saw this bill it is a federal
 
04:07:34.130 --> 04:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
requirement so that can still occur
 
04:07:35.870 --> 04:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
the sections that follow on page one
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't change anything in existing law
 
04:07:41.210 --> 04:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
they're just being re-lettered
 
04:07:44.150 --> 04:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
04:07:46.969 --> 04:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
there is a new section Roman 8.
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
it was our intent here to Simply spell
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
it out
 
04:07:51.950 --> 04:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
however we think this may not be needed
 
04:07:54.650 --> 04:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
with the changes that we make made at
 
04:07:56.750 --> 04:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
the start of the bill I suppose I can
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
leave that up to others who may be
 
04:08:00.290 --> 04:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
testifying or for the committee to
 
04:08:00.300 --> 04:08:02.030 align:start position:0%
testifying or for the committee to
address

04:08:02.030 --> 04:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:08:04.490 --> 04:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
some argue that suspension of licenses
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
Works to incentivize people in some way
 
04:08:09.229 --> 04:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
but is a good policy to inflict pain and
 
04:08:12.110 --> 04:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
hardship on the poor particularly when
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
the situation that brought them to that
 
04:08:15.530 --> 04:08:15.540 align:start position:0%
place had absolutely nothing to do with
 
04:08:17.330 --> 04:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
their driving behavior or their ability
 
04:08:19.250 --> 04:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
to drive safely
 
04:08:20.929 --> 04:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
lastly I would just like to address the
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that details that the DMV
 
04:08:25.309 --> 04:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
could lose four million dollars a year
 
04:08:27.710 --> 04:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
in revenue from restoration fees if this
 
04:08:29.090 --> 04:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
bill passes
 
04:08:31.010 --> 04:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
I would ask what the priority here
 
04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
should be should the state be relying on
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue primarily coming from the poor
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
we need to think about the economic
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
impact of these people keeping their
 
04:08:42.830 --> 04:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
license being able to work make money
 
04:08:45.170 --> 04:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
and spend money in our state and I would
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
guess that the impact to our state is
 
04:08:48.889 --> 04:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
significantly greater than a hundred
 
04:08:51.110 --> 04:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
dollar reinstatement fee being paid to
 
04:08:52.490 --> 04:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
the DMV
 
04:08:54.050 --> 04:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
I'll finish because I know there were
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
other people who want to testify but I
 
04:08:57.170 --> 04:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:02.570 --> 04:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:09:02.580 --> 04:09:04.309 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:09:07.070 --> 04:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
04:09:09.950 --> 04:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you in this
 
04:09:11.809 --> 04:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
this is probably going to be a crazy
 
04:09:13.849 --> 04:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
question but
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that
 
04:09:19.250 --> 04:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
you know if I if I'm speeding and I I
 
04:09:20.929 --> 04:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the bill because of
 
04:09:23.570 --> 04:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
because you don't have to pay it
 
04:09:26.210 --> 04:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
um maybe the third or fourth time I
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
still I'm still not paying it can you
 
04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
think of any any uh
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
reason that or something that could be
 
04:09:36.229 --> 04:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
done not because somebody's income but
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
if somebody is constantly uh doing a
 
04:09:41.689 --> 04:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
traffic violation that potentially could
 
04:09:44.090 --> 04:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
cause bodily harm rather speeding or
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
whatever that could be uh done to uh
 
04:09:49.130 --> 04:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
somehow maybe take the license away for
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time with the fine
 
04:09:53.090 --> 04:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding something along those
 
04:09:53.100 --> 04:09:54.290 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding something along those
lines

04:09:54.290 --> 04:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
lines
 
04:09:54.300 --> 04:09:55.370 align:start position:0%
lines
thanks

04:09:55.370 --> 04:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
04:09:58.670 --> 04:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:59.929 --> 04:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
um two things come to mind to answer
 
04:10:01.849 --> 04:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
that question one is the data I've seen
 
04:10:05.090 --> 04:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
is pardon me is that those who can
 
04:10:08.150 --> 04:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
afford to pay actually do pay
 
04:10:09.769 --> 04:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
and then they go on with their lives and
 
04:10:12.650 --> 04:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
keep driving there are really uh there's
 
04:10:15.170 --> 04:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
little evidence that people who have the
 
04:10:16.849 --> 04:10:16.859 align:start position:0%
ability to pay just don't because they
 
04:10:17.570 --> 04:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
don't think there will be any
 
04:10:17.580 --> 04:10:18.910 align:start position:0%
don't think there will be any
ramifications

04:10:18.910 --> 04:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
also I have a fact sheet here in front
 
04:10:22.790 --> 04:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
of me which I think you might get some
 
04:10:25.130 --> 04:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
information uh after me
 
04:10:25.140 --> 04:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
information uh after me
um

04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:28.010 --> 04:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
but they they can still have their
 
04:10:30.830 --> 04:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
license suspended if they are a habitual
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
offender if they go to that next level
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:39.130 --> 04:10:39.140 align:start position:0%
what are the questions
 
04:10:41.809 --> 04:10:41.819 align:start position:0%
representative Style
 
04:10:43.729 --> 04:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question in Section 8 it says
 
04:10:48.889 --> 04:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
the license uh shall not be suspended
 
04:10:50.929 --> 04:10:50.939 align:start position:0%
due to non-payment of fines or
 
04:10:53.269 --> 04:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
restitution how do you define
 
04:10:55.969 --> 04:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
restitution what does that mean thank
 
04:10:55.979 --> 04:10:57.229 align:start position:0%
restitution what does that mean thank
you

04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:10:59.570 --> 04:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question actually
 
04:11:01.610 --> 04:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
um what flag to this section is we need
 
04:11:03.530 --> 04:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
to fix it is it also should say if we
 
04:11:06.290 --> 04:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
keep it finds fees and restitution
 
04:11:12.530 --> 04:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:14.570 --> 04:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
04:11:14.580 --> 04:11:16.969 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
sellers

04:11:16.969 --> 04:11:16.979 align:start position:0%
sellers
 
04:11:19.010 --> 04:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:11:23.210 --> 04:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
so if someone gets a ticket today
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
and they just don't pay it they're not
 
04:11:27.729 --> 04:11:27.739 align:start position:0%
habitual they just don't pay it
 
04:11:33.469 --> 04:11:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:35.689 --> 04:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
disciplining them if you want to say
 
04:11:37.370 --> 04:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this law that would
 
04:11:41.090 --> 04:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
if they are if they don't respond
 
04:11:46.370 --> 04:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
um they
 
04:11:49.370 --> 04:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
could be considered a habitual offender
 
04:11:52.849 --> 04:11:52.859 align:start position:0%
and they uh person who fails to appear
 
04:11:54.349 --> 04:11:54.359 align:start position:0%
could have a bench warrant issued for
 
04:11:55.610 --> 04:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
their arrest
 
04:11:57.530 --> 04:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
and they could subsequently
 
04:11:57.540 --> 04:11:58.250 align:start position:0%
and they could subsequently
um

04:11:58.250 --> 04:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
if they encounter the police be dealt
 
04:12:04.130 --> 04:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:05.450 --> 04:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
do you want to follow
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
so basically you're saying that they
 
04:12:11.090 --> 04:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
have to at some point respond and pay
 
04:12:14.210 --> 04:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
that fine yeah I have another note here
 
04:12:15.769 --> 04:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
forgive me I had a whole lot of
 
04:12:17.870 --> 04:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
information coming into this that if the
 
04:12:20.809 --> 04:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
person does not pay a fine
 
04:12:23.150 --> 04:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
um it explicitly allows the court to
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
notify that non-payer that a hearing can
 
04:12:27.769 --> 04:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
be scheduled at which the court will
 
04:12:29.450 --> 04:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
decide if they actually have the ability
 
04:12:31.550 --> 04:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
to pay the fine
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
so if they do have the ability if the
 
04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
court determines they have the ability
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
to pay the fine and then they do not pay
 
04:12:41.210 --> 04:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
then they can be jailed at a rate of 150
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
a day so there are other options that
 
04:12:47.870 --> 04:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:50.210 --> 04:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
04:12:55.729 --> 04:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman on this um
 
04:13:00.170 --> 04:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
uh online page one line five where it
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
talks about this is in conjunction with
 
04:13:05.689 --> 04:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
uh motor vehicle offense unless
 
04:13:07.849 --> 04:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
otherwise allowed under law do you have
 
04:13:09.889 --> 04:13:09.899 align:start position:0%
any idea what might be considered under
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh otherwise under the law
 
04:13:12.960 --> 04:13:15.110 align:start position:0%
uh otherwise under the law
okay

04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:17.809 --> 04:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
I may defer to the people who helped me
 
04:13:19.670 --> 04:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
draft the uh
 
04:13:19.680 --> 04:13:20.929 align:start position:0%
draft the uh
the bill

04:13:20.929 --> 04:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:13:22.610 --> 04:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
for explicitly what they were referring
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
to with that
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm assuming it sorry I don't
 
04:13:28.010 --> 04:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but I'm also assuming it
 
04:13:31.610 --> 04:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
could refer to other statutes that uh
 
04:13:33.469 --> 04:13:33.479 align:start position:0%
state that the suspension would be
 
04:13:35.570 --> 04:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
allowed which is I don't know if the top
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
of my head but it's where it lists all
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the different times when it is
 
04:13:44.150 --> 04:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.130 --> 04:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
what are the questions representative
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:13:50.150 --> 04:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
you uh representative solorski for
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
um on Section 8 on the on line 17.
 
04:13:58.729 --> 04:13:58.739 align:start position:0%
we where it says uh comply with a
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
sentencing order that's imposed a duty
 
04:14:02.809 --> 04:14:02.819 align:start position:0%
to pay fines fees or restitutions in a
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
criminal case
 
04:14:07.610 --> 04:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
this section looks like it's uh sorry
 
04:14:08.510 --> 04:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
can you just tell me where you're
 
04:14:10.370 --> 04:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
looking uh second page
 
04:14:12.349 --> 04:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh line 17
 
04:14:15.349 --> 04:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay says fees or restitutions in a
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
criminal case
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
so it looks like this section's about
 
04:14:19.199 --> 04:14:21.170 align:start position:0%
so it looks like this section's about
allowing

04:14:21.170 --> 04:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
04:14:23.570 --> 04:14:23.580 align:start position:0%
things to be expunged from the records
 
04:14:26.090 --> 04:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
so a criminal case are we talking a
 
04:14:29.030 --> 04:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle violation or
 
04:14:36.290 --> 04:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
I believe it has to do with if the
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
license was suspended
 
04:14:50.750 --> 04:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
due to another uh situation not the
 
04:14:53.210 --> 04:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
fines or fees but to a criminal case
 
04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
um that it would be expunged
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
but I would want clarification if that
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
if that is a broad
 
04:15:04.849 --> 04:15:04.859 align:start position:0%
um reference to all criminal cases I
 
04:15:07.370 --> 04:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
don't I didn't believe so okay thank you
 
04:15:10.130 --> 04:15:10.140 align:start position:0%
I may be reading it wrong though
 
04:15:12.349 --> 04:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
if it helps keep your questions we have
 
04:15:14.689 --> 04:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
somebody later on that may be able to
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
answer them more specifically any other
 
04:15:19.610 --> 04:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none I've got six just kidding
 
04:15:25.630 --> 04:15:25.640 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
I thought you'd go hard on me chairman
 
04:15:33.710 --> 04:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:36.050 --> 04:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
um next up chair recognizes
 
04:15:37.849 --> 04:15:37.859 align:start position:0%
after being here all day you're moving
 
04:15:39.410 --> 04:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
up in the ranks Eva Castillo
 
04:15:41.809 --> 04:15:41.819 align:start position:0%
representing herself in support of the
 
04:15:59.809 --> 04:15:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.269 --> 04:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
um I am in support we are in support of
 
04:16:03.889 --> 04:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
this bill I'd still need to introduce
 
04:16:06.110 --> 04:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
yourself again Castillo I live in
 
04:16:06.120 --> 04:16:08.389 align:start position:0%
yourself again Castillo I live in
Manchester

04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
04:16:11.150 --> 04:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm a community advocate we all know
 
04:16:13.729 --> 04:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
that everything has gone up the cost of
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
everything the cost of living in
 
04:16:17.929 --> 04:16:17.939 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have a horrendous
 
04:16:21.769 --> 04:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
situation with rent and uh like people
 
04:16:23.510 --> 04:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't know where to live and their rents
 
04:16:26.150 --> 04:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
are going through the sky the services
 
04:16:29.090 --> 04:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
have got have doubled up electricity
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
Ford everything has gone up so you know
 
04:16:36.170 --> 04:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
to to penalize somebody for not paying a
 
04:16:38.210 --> 04:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
fine these people are going to have to
 
04:16:40.189 --> 04:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
choose between paying a fine or feeding
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
their children or paying their for their
 
04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
medication or paying for the Heat or
 
04:16:47.090 --> 04:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
paying for something so who do you think
 
04:16:49.309 --> 04:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
they're gonna they're gonna choose so
 
04:16:51.729 --> 04:16:51.739 align:start position:0%
this will carry catastrophic
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
consequences for someone to lose their
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
license they like we talked this morning
 
04:17:01.189 --> 04:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
they need licenses to go to work they
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
need their licenses to to go about their
 
04:17:06.050 --> 04:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
daily living to go to the doctors to do
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
so many things so this this is a bad
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
punishment for not only for poor people
 
04:17:16.670 --> 04:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
also for a lot of the new Americans that
 
04:17:19.670 --> 04:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
have the low paying jobs that take care
 
04:17:23.389 --> 04:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
of our community uh in so many ways that
 
04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
we take for granted but we don't
 
04:17:27.410 --> 04:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
recognize so please take into
 
04:17:30.290 --> 04:17:30.300 align:start position:0%
consideration the consequences of
 
04:17:32.150 --> 04:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
passing a bill like this on a purely
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
economic thing thank you
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
the community
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none I
 
04:17:42.050 --> 04:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
next up I do apologize it is customary
 
04:17:44.150 --> 04:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
to let our other Representatives
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
go first so they can go about their
 
04:17:48.050 --> 04:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
business uh chair recognizes
 
04:17:49.790 --> 04:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman of the committee
 
04:17:59.760 --> 04:18:00.469 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman of the committee
um

04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
Tony lekkis I represent Hillsboro 38 the
 
04:18:06.769 --> 04:18:06.779 align:start position:0%
towns of Hudson and Litchfield I handed
 
04:18:08.870 --> 04:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
out some written testimony I'm not going
 
04:18:09.889 --> 04:18:09.899 align:start position:0%
to read it
 
04:18:09.899 --> 04:18:10.790 align:start position:0%
to read it
um

04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:12.590 --> 04:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
first of all I agree completely with
 
04:18:14.570 --> 04:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
what's been said before
 
04:18:16.250 --> 04:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
I mean while revoking a person's
 
04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
driver's license may be an effective way
 
04:18:19.969 --> 04:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
to coerce somebody who's got the money
 
04:18:20.929 --> 04:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
04:18:23.570 --> 04:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
it can create a you know a real
 
04:18:26.090 --> 04:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
Injustice to people that can't pay
 
04:18:28.070 --> 04:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
there is a provision as I understand it
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
and current law that if someone can't
 
04:18:33.050 --> 04:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
pay their license won't be suspended but
 
04:18:35.090 --> 04:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
the problem there is you have to
 
04:18:37.969 --> 04:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
proactively you know go to the court to
 
04:18:39.590 --> 04:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
arrange that and the people who have the
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
most problems here
 
04:18:42.410 --> 04:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
are they're not going to have somebody
 
04:18:44.269 --> 04:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
representing them in most cases they're
 
04:18:45.769 --> 04:18:45.779 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be aware of the law
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
they don't know how to work the system
 
04:18:50.809 --> 04:18:50.819 align:start position:0%
um and and basically that provision I
 
04:18:53.689 --> 04:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
think in most cases is ineffective
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
um as the part of speaker said
 
04:18:58.010 --> 04:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
you know with the change they could then
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
later be brought back in to deal with
 
04:19:02.330 --> 04:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
that particular issue where you know
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's then presented and they don't
 
04:19:05.929 --> 04:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
have to bring it up first and uh you
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
know they can present their situation
 
04:19:10.370 --> 04:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
which I think is a better situation I
 
04:19:12.290 --> 04:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
you know the testimony of the public
 
04:19:14.269 --> 04:19:14.279 align:start position:0%
hearing is for people to learn things uh
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
that occurred for me here I was unaware
 
04:19:19.130 --> 04:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
that there was an exception for child
 
04:19:20.450 --> 04:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
support and that there was a federal
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
requirement around that I included a
 
04:19:25.070 --> 04:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
personal story of my extended family of
 
04:19:27.290 --> 04:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
somebody ran into problem with this but
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
it did have to do with child support So
 
04:19:32.030 --> 04:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would not help but
 
04:19:33.530 --> 04:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
um the similar kind of things can happen
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
for things other than child support you
 
04:19:37.130 --> 04:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
know somebody has
 
04:19:39.410 --> 04:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
a situation where you know somebody's a
 
04:19:41.570 --> 04:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
kind of low-level contractor doing
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
siding windows that sort of thing
 
04:19:46.130 --> 04:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
their income is uh you know very
 
04:19:48.889 --> 04:19:48.899 align:start position:0%
seasonal uh very irregular and in this
 
04:19:48.899 --> 04:19:49.790 align:start position:0%
seasonal uh very irregular and in this
case

04:19:49.790 --> 04:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
um this person was able to pay extra
 
04:19:53.389 --> 04:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
when he had money come in and couldn't
 
04:19:55.610 --> 04:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
pay later when he couldn't and because
 
04:19:57.830 --> 04:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
that payment had to go directly to the
 
04:20:00.769 --> 04:20:00.779 align:start position:0%
state they ended up taking his license
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
um during a you know off season and then
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
he was very difficult to go to work I
 
04:20:07.969 --> 04:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
mean you can't you know take an Uber if
 
04:20:09.410 --> 04:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
you got to move your work truck you got
 
04:20:11.330 --> 04:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
to find somebody who could drive it and
 
04:20:14.330 --> 04:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
uh it you know he was able to actually
 
04:20:17.050 --> 04:20:17.060 align:start position:0%
um was less able to pay his obligations
 
04:20:19.849 --> 04:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
as a result of that
 
04:20:19.859 --> 04:20:20.809 align:start position:0%
as a result of that
um

04:20:20.809 --> 04:20:20.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:24.050 --> 04:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
and I mean I I've heard I don't know you
 
04:20:25.130 --> 04:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
know the position of anyone in the
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee but I've heard from others
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
that you know people that don't pay
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
Their fines their you know scoff laws
 
04:20:33.050 --> 04:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
and they don't have much sympathy for
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
them but if you have somebody who's in a
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
very difficult financial situation and
 
04:20:39.530 --> 04:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
they're barely getting by
 
04:20:41.630 --> 04:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it makes any sense to
 
04:20:43.729 --> 04:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
remove their ability to drive legally
 
04:20:46.250 --> 04:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
because what's going to happen is out of
 
04:20:48.650 --> 04:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
desperation they're likely to end up
 
04:20:50.570 --> 04:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
driving illegally and then if they get
 
04:20:52.849 --> 04:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
caught doing that they're further meshed
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
in the criminal justice system further
 
04:20:55.199 --> 04:20:56.689 align:start position:0%
in the criminal justice system further
costs

04:20:56.689 --> 04:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
um and just a spiral into a real mess
 
04:21:02.750 --> 04:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
and that's where people that are just
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
barely getting by as it is and I just
 
04:21:07.250 --> 04:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a Justice to do that to
 
04:21:08.809 --> 04:21:08.819 align:start position:0%
them and in some cases out of
 
04:21:10.250 --> 04:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
desperation may end up resorting to
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
Crime just to support themselves and
 
04:21:13.969 --> 04:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
their family and I don't think that's
 
04:21:15.290 --> 04:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
what they want
 
04:21:17.689 --> 04:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
um so I see this bill as a practical
 
04:21:20.330 --> 04:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
response to the situation
 
04:21:22.250 --> 04:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and and just I think a good
 
04:21:24.349 --> 04:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
government thing so that's all I have to
 
04:21:26.929 --> 04:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:21:28.199 --> 04:21:29.689 align:start position:0%

04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes Lily Jackson

04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
pay these fines and fees
 
04:22:23.809 --> 04:22:23.819 align:start position:0%
once suspended an individual will have
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
to fulfill the requirements attached to
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
the suspension pay an additional
 
04:22:30.170 --> 04:22:30.180 align:start position:0%
reinstatement fee and possibly have to
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
retake their driver's license exam if
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
the individual's license has suspended
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
for three or more years to clarify
 
04:22:38.809 --> 04:22:38.819 align:start position:0%
addressing a suspension of a driver's
 
04:22:41.090 --> 04:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
license for unpaid court fines and fees
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
would have no impact on the state's
 
04:22:45.769 --> 04:22:45.779 align:start position:0%
ability to spend driver's license for
 
04:22:48.110 --> 04:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
failure to take child support further to
 
04:22:50.269 --> 04:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
fulfill requirements by sentence or
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
failure to appear when ordered to do so
 
04:22:54.530 --> 04:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
it would also not impact driver's
 
04:22:56.330 --> 04:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
license suspensions are part of a
 
04:22:59.210 --> 04:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
traffic or criminal violation
 
04:23:00.530 --> 04:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
wealth-based driver's license
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
suspensions punish people simply because
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
they are poor suspensions do not improve
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
the outcome of debt Collections and
 
04:23:08.150 --> 04:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
there is growing evidence that
 
04:23:10.309 --> 04:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
eliminating suspensions for non-payment
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
can save jurisdictions money and
 
04:23:14.450 --> 04:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
maintain or even increase compliance
 
04:23:14.460 --> 04:23:15.410 align:start position:0%
maintain or even increase compliance
rates

04:23:15.410 --> 04:23:15.420 align:start position:0%
rates
 
04:23:17.389 --> 04:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
since fines and fees are primarily on
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
those who cannot afford them the
 
04:23:20.630 --> 04:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
collection rates of these debts are
 
04:23:23.510 --> 04:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
usually frequently low
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
wealth-based driver's license
 
04:23:26.809 --> 04:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
suspensions also have no Public Safety
 
04:23:28.969 --> 04:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
justification and place unnecessary
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
hurdles in front of people seeking to
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
support their families
 
04:23:34.849 --> 04:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
about driver's license is vital for
 
04:23:36.530 --> 04:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
accessing Basics like employment
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
doctor's office and bank accounts the
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
importance of this license is even
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
greater in New Hampshire because the
 
04:23:44.090 --> 04:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
state and the majority of its localities
 
04:23:45.950 --> 04:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
lack basic public transportation
 
04:23:45.960 --> 04:23:47.570 align:start position:0%
lack basic public transportation
infrastructure

04:23:47.570 --> 04:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
thus this place people in the impossible
 
04:23:53.210 --> 04:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
position choose to drive illegally and
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
risk incarceration and more fines in
 
04:23:57.229 --> 04:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
order to get to work and meet personal
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
or family needs or choose not to drive
 
04:24:01.849 --> 04:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
and lose needed income and access to
 
04:24:04.429 --> 04:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
education and other services
 
04:24:06.410 --> 04:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
these suspensions have no Financial
 
04:24:08.809 --> 04:24:08.819 align:start position:0%
justification while the proponents of
 
04:24:09.889 --> 04:24:09.899 align:start position:0%
wealth-based driver's license
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
suspensions argue that they are
 
04:24:13.010 --> 04:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
necessary to ensure payments of
 
04:24:15.290 --> 04:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
outstanding Court debts research shows
 
04:24:17.570 --> 04:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
that this is not true and cities where
 
04:24:19.370 --> 04:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
debt-based sanction was reformed there
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
has been no negative impact on the
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
collection of fines
 
04:24:24.769 --> 04:24:24.779 align:start position:0%
this follows common sense as people
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
without the ability to access public
 
04:24:28.610 --> 04:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
transportation or reliable
 
04:24:31.490 --> 04:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
transportation will will be unable to
 
04:24:34.010 --> 04:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
earn money to pay back their Court debt
 
04:24:36.050 --> 04:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
this also perpetuates New Hampshire's
 
04:24:38.570 --> 04:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
two-tier justice system Equal justice
 
04:24:40.370 --> 04:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
under law does not exist when a person
 
04:24:42.050 --> 04:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
is punished determined by their wealth
 
04:24:43.849 --> 04:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
rather than their actions
 
04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
people who commit suction act face very
 
04:24:47.929 --> 04:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
different punishments because of nothing
 
04:24:50.150 --> 04:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
more than how much money they have in
 
04:24:52.130 --> 04:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
their bank account for a person with
 
04:24:53.929 --> 04:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
wealth a traffic ticket is nothing more
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
than a nuisance for a person without
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
wealth it can mean suspension of their
 
04:25:00.050 --> 04:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
driver's license and this ensnares
 
04:25:02.689 --> 04:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
people into the criminal justice system
 
04:25:04.309 --> 04:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
they arrest more funds and fees and
 
04:25:06.650 --> 04:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
entanglement to the justice system and
 
04:25:09.050 --> 04:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
incarceration it is past time for
 
04:25:11.210 --> 04:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
lawmakers to eliminate the law that only
 
04:25:13.370 --> 04:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
serves to punish people and push
 
04:25:15.290 --> 04:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
families further into poverty and
 
04:25:16.849 --> 04:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
unnecessary contact with the criminal
 
04:25:18.229 --> 04:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
legal system
 
04:25:20.510 --> 04:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
in order to reduce the cyclical nature
 
04:25:22.309 --> 04:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
of poverty and increase Public Safety
 
04:25:24.290 --> 04:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire must end wealth-based
 
04:25:26.510 --> 04:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license suspensions I urge this
 
04:25:29.090 --> 04:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
committee to support HB 650 and end the
 
04:25:32.050 --> 04:25:32.060 align:start position:0%
two-tier justice system
 
04:25:34.250 --> 04:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:25:42.170 --> 04:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:45.110 --> 04:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
oh next up also in support of the bill
 
04:25:47.689 --> 04:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
Mikey Levis
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:50.880 --> 04:25:54.410 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

04:25:54.410 --> 04:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:56.570 --> 04:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Mikey Levis I'm speaking
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill it's commonly
 
04:26:01.370 --> 04:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
thought that driving is a privilege in
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
fact driving is a right in a lot of New
 
04:26:05.809 --> 04:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's very difficult to get
 
04:26:07.969 --> 04:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
around if you don't have a car you can't
 
04:26:09.710 --> 04:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
get to work you can't get to the grocery
 
04:26:12.590 --> 04:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
store you could starve you could go on
 
04:26:14.450 --> 04:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
welfare I don't think people want to
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily pay for a lot of these
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
things I've been without a car I'm
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
having car issues right now so in a
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
sense this speaks to me I've struggled
 
04:26:24.769 --> 04:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
with this
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is about a fundamental right if
 
04:26:28.429 --> 04:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
you're a Democrat this is a social
 
04:26:30.590 --> 04:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
justice issue if you're a republican
 
04:26:32.450 --> 04:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
think of it in the frame of gun rights
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
could you imagine if your gun rights
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
were suspended because you missed a
 
04:26:39.110 --> 04:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
court date or you missed a fine
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
in fact this bill I think needs a few
 
04:26:43.309 --> 04:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
amendments because it still allows if
 
04:26:45.410 --> 04:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
you miss a court date they can still
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
suspend your license so then you're
 
04:26:49.370 --> 04:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
going to have even more trouble
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
paying the fines once you are able to
 
04:26:52.969 --> 04:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
get to court
 
04:26:55.070 --> 04:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
I have missed court dates I did get it
 
04:26:57.469 --> 04:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
corrected but it happens they send one
 
04:27:00.170 --> 04:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
notice out and the mail can be issues
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
people move around there's all kinds of
 
04:27:04.790 --> 04:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
problems with that so across the country
 
04:27:07.309 --> 04:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
this is becoming an increasing issue
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
because people for the most part want to
 
04:27:11.689 --> 04:27:11.699 align:start position:0%
pay their fi want to pay the fines and
 
04:27:14.210 --> 04:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
if you can't drive to work
 
04:27:16.130 --> 04:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
you can't earn that much I've worked in
 
04:27:17.389 --> 04:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
restaurant Industries and half the
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
people there often are suspended for
 
04:27:20.330 --> 04:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
child support or any number of other
 
04:27:20.340 --> 04:27:21.490 align:start position:0%
child support or any number of other
things

04:27:21.490 --> 04:27:21.500 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:27:23.630 --> 04:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
speeding tickets any number of things
 
04:27:23.640 --> 04:27:25.309 align:start position:0%
speeding tickets any number of things
and

04:27:25.309 --> 04:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:26.750 --> 04:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
if they could get their license back
 
04:27:28.849 --> 04:27:28.859 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to earn more
 
04:27:31.250 --> 04:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
and subsequently pay the fines you have
 
04:27:33.110 --> 04:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
to think about the single mother
 
04:27:35.330 --> 04:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
who is struggling to get her kids to
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
school find someone to babysit get to
 
04:27:41.570 --> 04:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
work they often have to
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
get friends or neighbors and that can be
 
04:27:45.889 --> 04:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
difficult even with
 
04:27:47.809 --> 04:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
people here there's a lack of density in
 
04:27:48.769 --> 04:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
addition to lack of public
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
transportation there's often a lack of
 
04:27:53.389 --> 04:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
people around
 
04:27:55.550 --> 04:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
you also have to think of the young man
 
04:27:57.229 --> 04:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
who's trying to get his life back
 
04:27:59.750 --> 04:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
together and just wants to get
 
04:28:02.090 --> 04:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
everything in order he's trying trying
 
04:28:03.950 --> 04:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
real hard doesn't want to do drugs
 
04:28:05.809 --> 04:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to fall into alcohol or
 
04:28:08.689 --> 04:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
depression or suicide and
 
04:28:10.969 --> 04:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
not being able to get to work and
 
04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
earn a living can prevent you know can
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
cause a lot of problems
 
04:28:17.090 --> 04:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
so these are the things we need to think
 
04:28:19.550 --> 04:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
about it's really imperative that this
 
04:28:24.290 --> 04:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
gets a 19 to zero not 18 to 1 not 17 to
 
04:28:26.750 --> 04:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
two everyone has to be in agreement on
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
this this is a fundamental right that
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
people are able to get to their job or
 
04:28:34.070 --> 04:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
where they need to go for their children
 
04:28:35.570 --> 04:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
this is not going to affect if
 
04:28:37.429 --> 04:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
somebody's a dangerous driver that's
 
04:28:40.130 --> 04:28:40.140 align:start position:0%
fine we need other remediation things
 
04:28:42.410 --> 04:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
for that but that's understandable but
 
04:28:44.090 --> 04:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
just missing a court date or missing a
 
04:28:44.100 --> 04:28:45.170 align:start position:0%
just missing a court date or missing a
fine

04:28:45.170 --> 04:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's just not acceptable because
 
04:28:49.729 --> 04:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
the only way to pay your fine is if you
 
04:28:50.750 --> 04:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
can work
 
04:28:53.330 --> 04:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
the state claims that they'll lose
 
04:28:55.309 --> 04:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars if this bill passes
 
04:28:57.410 --> 04:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make any sense at all if
 
04:28:58.969 --> 04:28:58.979 align:start position:0%
you can if you can get to work you can
 
04:29:01.610 --> 04:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
pay your fines if you get if you can get
 
04:29:03.530 --> 04:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
a better job you can earn more the state
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
will get more tax money this will
 
04:29:08.269 --> 04:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
probably be a boon to the state revenue
 
04:29:10.670 --> 04:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
because of that and to our friends in
 
04:29:12.590 --> 04:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
law and law enforcement over there it
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
creates less friction with the community
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
when people aren't driving around
 
04:29:17.149 --> 04:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
suspended people drive around suspended
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
04:29:20.689 --> 04:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
and it creates a risk they take risks
 
04:29:23.090 --> 04:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
and dangers and they might
 
04:29:24.769 --> 04:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
make the wrong turn or something and put
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
people in danger if they're driving
 
04:29:26.279 --> 04:29:27.950 align:start position:0%
people in danger if they're driving
legally

04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
legally
 
04:29:29.809 --> 04:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
that won't happen and then there will be
 
04:29:29.819 --> 04:29:31.790 align:start position:0%
that won't happen and then there will be
more

04:29:31.790 --> 04:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
or less friction with the law
 
04:29:34.790 --> 04:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement community so they don't have
 
04:29:35.929 --> 04:29:35.939 align:start position:0%
to worry every time they're stopping
 
04:29:36.950 --> 04:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
someone that it's going to be a problem
 
04:29:38.570 --> 04:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
so this is really in everyone's interest
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's no one who
 
04:29:43.370 --> 04:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
who should really be opposing this bill
 
04:29:43.380 --> 04:29:45.710 align:start position:0%
who should really be opposing this bill
and

04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:47.570 --> 04:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
04:29:49.729 --> 04:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
that's really all there is to it in my
 
04:29:51.769 --> 04:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
view is just getting this done I know
 
04:29:53.570 --> 04:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
Maine a few years ago did it other
 
04:29:55.490 --> 04:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
states in the country are are trying to
 
04:29:56.929 --> 04:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
pass this in similar bills there's court
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
cases circulating but it's been
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
difficult because there isn't really a
 
04:30:00.000 --> 04:30:01.370 align:start position:0%
difficult because there isn't really a
constitutional

04:30:01.370 --> 04:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
clear thing about this but I would say
 
04:30:05.809 --> 04:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
it's a cruel and unusual punishment to
 
04:30:07.610 --> 04:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
stop to stop someone from being able to
 
04:30:09.590 --> 04:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
get to work and get to the grocery store
 
04:30:11.929 --> 04:30:11.939 align:start position:0%
because they didn't pay uh something as
 
04:30:14.689 --> 04:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
simple as like a 50 or 70 dollar fine
 
04:30:16.969 --> 04:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
so that's really just a
 
04:30:16.979 --> 04:30:17.530 align:start position:0%
so that's really just a
the

04:30:17.530 --> 04:30:17.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
fundamental of it fundamentals of it and
 
04:30:21.769 --> 04:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
the only reason it wasn't put in the
 
04:30:24.670 --> 04:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights is because back in the
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
1770s when the frame or 1780s excused me
 
04:30:28.849 --> 04:30:28.859 align:start position:0%
when the framers were putting together
 
04:30:30.050 --> 04:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
the Constitution it was totally
 
04:30:30.060 --> 04:30:31.250 align:start position:0%
the Constitution it was totally
inconceivable

04:30:31.250 --> 04:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
inconceivable
 
04:30:31.260 --> 04:30:32.570 align:start position:0%
inconceivable
that

04:30:32.570 --> 04:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:34.729 --> 04:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
there would be law enforcement going
 
04:30:36.410 --> 04:30:36.420 align:start position:0%
around and stopping people on their
 
04:30:38.450 --> 04:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
horse carriages saying where's your you
 
04:30:40.309 --> 04:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
know where's your valid horse carriage
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
license that's ridiculous so they didn't
 
04:30:44.389 --> 04:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
even conceive of it they didn't even
 
04:30:46.010 --> 04:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
conceive of the original Bill of Rights
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
they had to the more I guess radical
 
04:30:50.870 --> 04:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
sectors had to say no we need these
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
rights so they if they had seen how
 
04:30:55.370 --> 04:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
things turned out they probably would
 
04:30:56.689 --> 04:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
have put some sort of right to
 
04:30:59.330 --> 04:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
Transportation or right to
 
04:31:00.830 --> 04:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
get around
 
04:31:02.330 --> 04:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
so I think that was an unfortunate
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
oversight that we're dealing with but
 
04:31:06.769 --> 04:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
it's really a fundamental thing
 
04:31:09.649 --> 04:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
that we need to change so I am going to
 
04:31:11.090 --> 04:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know the process for amending
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to suggest like one or two
 
04:31:14.090 --> 04:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
amendments like the court court
 
04:31:15.769 --> 04:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
appearance thing
 
04:31:15.779 --> 04:31:16.790 align:start position:0%
appearance thing
but

04:31:16.790 --> 04:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:31:19.010 --> 04:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
I will look into that but as it is this
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
is a good bill to start with thank you
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that the prime sponsor is
 
04:31:25.010 --> 04:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
right behind you if you have some ideas
 
04:31:26.870 --> 04:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
you'd like to share with her any
 
04:31:29.809 --> 04:31:29.819 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:40.790 --> 04:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh chair recognizes looking for three
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
minutes of time in support of the bill
 
04:31:53.210 --> 04:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
ah thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
04:31:57.050 --> 04:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
the committee just for the record my
 
04:31:58.610 --> 04:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
name is Ross Connolly I'm the deputy
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
state director for Americans for
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
Prosperity here in New Hampshire here to
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
voice our support for HB 650. uh I'll
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
try to be brief because there's been a
 
04:32:08.990 --> 04:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the points talked about but
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
driving is obviously an a critically
 
04:32:13.490 --> 04:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
important factor for every Granite
 
04:32:15.649 --> 04:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
stator to get to work to pick up their
 
04:32:18.790 --> 04:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
kids to access basic needs
 
04:32:21.290 --> 04:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
driving a motor vehicle can be a
 
04:32:24.110 --> 04:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
privilege however the use of driver's
 
04:32:25.729 --> 04:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
license suspension should be much more
 
04:32:28.429 --> 04:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
targeted than it is currently
 
04:32:28.439 --> 04:32:30.170 align:start position:0%
targeted than it is currently
um

04:32:30.170 --> 04:32:30.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:32.450 --> 04:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
this is a tool that's really necessary
 
04:32:34.670 --> 04:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
when somebody is a a true habitual
 
04:32:36.889 --> 04:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
offender on the roads and is a danger to
 
04:32:39.290 --> 04:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
the public uh because of their actions
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
while driving uh suspending somebody's
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh license for non-driving related
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
issues uh obviously as as has been said
 
04:32:52.429 --> 04:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
uh defeats the perfect purpose and often
 
04:32:54.290 --> 04:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
results in the opposite consequence
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
since the person cannot get to work they
 
04:32:58.610 --> 04:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
cannot pay the fine and they're stuck in
 
04:33:00.290 --> 04:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
a cycle of where they're breaking the
 
04:33:01.969 --> 04:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
law because they're operating on a
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
suspended license
 
04:33:06.410 --> 04:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
these suspensions also hurt businesses
 
04:33:08.150 --> 04:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
I'll point out by making it more
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
difficult for workers to get to and from
 
04:33:13.429 --> 04:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh their jobs to provide for their
 
04:33:16.250 --> 04:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
families uh and these are consequences
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
that are particularly Troublesome in a
 
04:33:20.510 --> 04:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
state where we have an acute labor
 
04:33:22.910 --> 04:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
shortage we want to make sure that that
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
we're working with workers and
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
especially with people who are not a
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
danger on the road that they should be
 
04:33:32.330 --> 04:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
able to continue to operate a motor
 
04:33:36.170 --> 04:33:36.180 align:start position:0%
vehicle on the road so removing Granite
 
04:33:38.570 --> 04:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
status driving privileges guarantees a
 
04:33:40.631 --> 04:33:40.641 align:start position:0%
set pack as a setback in payment
 
04:33:42.650 --> 04:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
especially since the individual's
 
04:33:44.631 --> 04:33:44.641 align:start position:0%
employment as I mentioned may be
 
04:33:47.209 --> 04:33:47.219 align:start position:0%
affected so for these reasons we urge
 
04:33:49.070 --> 04:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
the committee to to move this bill ought
 
04:33:50.929 --> 04:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
to pass I'd be happy to take any
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
04:33:54.349 --> 04:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:33:54.359 --> 04:33:55.970 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

04:33:55.970 --> 04:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much you're
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:07.970 --> 04:34:07.980 align:start position:0%
uh next up she recognizes
 
04:34:10.429 --> 04:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
Richard head from the judicial branch
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh looking for five minutes not taking a
 
04:34:16.609 --> 04:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
position at this point that's correct um
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:34:19.250 --> 04:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
04:34:20.929 --> 04:34:20.939 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
04:34:23.090 --> 04:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch we don't have a
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
position on on the bill we recognize
 
04:34:28.269 --> 04:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
it's uh it involves a very complex
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
balancing of policies and we don't have
 
04:34:33.170 --> 04:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
a position on the policy itself but we
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
did want to talk about how it is we use
 
04:34:37.849 --> 04:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
this in the in in circumstances of
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
default and exactly what the process is
 
04:34:44.051 --> 04:34:44.061 align:start position:0%
we have relatively few tools available
 
04:34:46.970 --> 04:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
when somebody is not paying their fines
 
04:34:50.869 --> 04:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
we try if a person is not able to pay
 
04:34:53.090 --> 04:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
their Their fines in full we work out
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
payment plans if their circumstances
 
04:34:57.170 --> 04:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
change and they tell us their
 
04:34:58.849 --> 04:34:58.859 align:start position:0%
circumstances have changed we will
 
04:35:02.090 --> 04:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
modify that that payment plan we do not
 
04:35:04.250 --> 04:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
want people to get into default we work
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
with folks to get them to pay Their
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
fines in those instances where the fines
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
are not being paid
 
04:35:13.609 --> 04:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
um a default notice goes out and that
 
04:35:15.170 --> 04:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
goes to the Department of Safety the
 
04:35:17.090 --> 04:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
department of safety then notifies the
 
04:35:20.029 --> 04:35:20.039 align:start position:0%
individual license holder that they have
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
30 days to contact the court so it's not
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
we push a button their license is in
 
04:35:25.199 --> 04:35:26.269 align:start position:0%
we push a button their license is in
default

04:35:26.269 --> 04:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
default
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
um and and that's the end of it
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
we want
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
individuals to come to the court to work
 
04:35:36.529 --> 04:35:36.539 align:start position:0%
out a payment plan if they are unable to
 
04:35:38.810 --> 04:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
pay we would ask that you know we want
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
them to notify us tell us they are
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
unable to pay they'll get in front of a
 
04:35:44.029 --> 04:35:44.039 align:start position:0%
judge and that circumstance can be
 
04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:45.539 align:start position:0%
explained to the judge the judge can
 
04:35:48.349 --> 04:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
modify the order what
 
04:35:51.890 --> 04:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
what this is is a tool for the courts
 
04:35:55.490 --> 04:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
when there is a non-payment of a fine
 
04:35:58.250 --> 04:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
the other options are
 
04:35:58.260 --> 04:35:58.910 align:start position:0%
the other options are
um

04:35:58.910 --> 04:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:01.730 --> 04:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
are essentially defined that that they
 
04:36:03.289 --> 04:36:03.299 align:start position:0%
are in contempt of court there's an
 
04:36:05.570 --> 04:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
order they're in contempt that has its
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
own series of consequences this is a
 
04:36:11.929 --> 04:36:11.939 align:start position:0%
tool that essentially is a a notice you
 
04:36:15.529 --> 04:36:15.539 align:start position:0%
are in in trouble you're violating a
 
04:36:18.410 --> 04:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
court order and there is a balance in
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
policies as between the very important
 
04:36:22.490 --> 04:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
policy issues that folks have discussed
 
04:36:25.010 --> 04:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
we don't disagree with those we people
 
04:36:26.689 --> 04:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
who have a license are in better
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
position if they retain those licenses
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's employment it's a social fabric it
 
04:36:33.470 --> 04:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
has a whole lot of consequences
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
associated with losing that license we
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
are sensitive to that there's also a
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
respect for the courts of respect for
 
04:36:43.310 --> 04:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
the law aspect of it also that is a
 
04:36:45.369 --> 04:36:45.379 align:start position:0%
balancing consideration
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
so our only our only
 
04:36:51.890 --> 04:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
input I think is to say that we have
 
04:36:54.289 --> 04:36:54.299 align:start position:0%
very few tools available to us when a
 
04:36:56.510 --> 04:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
person gets into this position of being
 
04:36:59.631 --> 04:36:59.641 align:start position:0%
in default none of the solutions are
 
04:36:59.641 --> 04:37:00.769 align:start position:0%
in default none of the solutions are
great

04:37:00.769 --> 04:37:00.779 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:37:03.170 --> 04:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
um but this does provide a mechanism for
 
04:37:07.131 --> 04:37:07.141 align:start position:0%
notice opportunity to cure and uh and a
 
04:37:12.170 --> 04:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
cure to occur the other option of uh of
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
the finding of contempt is not a great
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
option and the option of Simply doing
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
nothing saying okay you didn't pay the
 
04:37:22.849 --> 04:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
fine don't pay it is also not a great
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
option in terms of respect for the court
 
04:37:28.010 --> 04:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
respect for uh for justice so
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
we understand and appreciate that it is
 
04:37:33.289 --> 04:37:33.299 align:start position:0%
a difficult process conflict but it is
 
04:37:35.209 --> 04:37:35.219 align:start position:0%
from the from the judicial branches
 
04:37:38.090 --> 04:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
perspective one tool a very few tools
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
that we have available and to take this
 
04:37:40.199 --> 04:37:41.209 align:start position:0%
that we have available and to take this
away

04:37:41.209 --> 04:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
complicates the the Opera sort of the
 
04:37:45.529 --> 04:37:45.539 align:start position:0%
options that are available to the court
 
04:37:47.570 --> 04:37:47.580 align:start position:0%
with that with that I'll conclude my
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
comments but would be happy to answer
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative Sykes
 
04:37:57.410 --> 04:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you sir for
 
04:37:59.330 --> 04:37:59.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:38:01.490 --> 04:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
um would it be accurate for me to say
 
04:38:01.500 --> 04:38:03.230 align:start position:0%
um would it be accurate for me to say
that

04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:05.570 --> 04:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
whenever the process gets to a point
 
04:38:08.269 --> 04:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
where it's an interaction between the
 
04:38:11.150 --> 04:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
person who has the initial fine and
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
having to go to court in order to take
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
some of the resolution steps that you
 
04:38:18.051 --> 04:38:18.061 align:start position:0%
identified that that is a much more
 
04:38:24.410 --> 04:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:27.051 --> 04:38:27.061 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I
 
04:38:28.369 --> 04:38:28.379 align:start position:0%
apologize I may not have understood
 
04:38:29.990 --> 04:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
exactly which is the procedure that's
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
well let me let me rephrase it then
 
04:38:34.730 --> 04:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
um what I was asking I wanted to make
 
04:38:37.010 --> 04:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
sure that if I were to characterize the
 
04:38:41.390 --> 04:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
process of a person who has their
 
04:38:43.490 --> 04:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
license suspended and has not paid the
 
04:38:43.500 --> 04:38:44.570 align:start position:0%
license suspended and has not paid the
fine

04:38:44.570 --> 04:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
that anytime that process further
 
04:38:49.310 --> 04:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
devolves into more interaction with the
 
04:38:52.131 --> 04:38:52.141 align:start position:0%
court system it is reasonable to presume
 
04:38:54.529 --> 04:38:54.539 align:start position:0%
that it'll be more costly more time if
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
time costly in terms of time and money
 
04:39:00.289 --> 04:39:00.299 align:start position:0%
certainly if if the default is
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately implemented and that person
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
then has as a result of that
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
consequences that that flow from that
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
that involves additional Court actions
 
04:39:10.250 --> 04:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
and additional Court proceedings that's
 
04:39:10.260 --> 04:39:11.990 align:start position:0%
and additional Court proceedings that's
correct

04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:39:15.470 --> 04:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.650 --> 04:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
would the justice and I now this is just
 
04:39:20.689 --> 04:39:20.699 align:start position:0%
a genuine question
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
would the justice system
 
04:39:23.520 --> 04:39:25.250 align:start position:0%
would the justice system
for

04:39:25.250 --> 04:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:39:28.609 --> 04:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
driving offenses Etc be more efficient
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
for the state and the judicial system if
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
we remove one of the least
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
the most one of the more minor
 
04:39:37.680 --> 04:39:42.530 align:start position:0%
the most one of the more minor
considerations

04:39:42.530 --> 04:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:44.330 --> 04:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how so truthfully I
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
how many sort of cases or fines we're
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
talking about to be able to sort of give
 
04:39:54.050 --> 04:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
a scale of that so I I so I apologize I
 
04:39:57.288 --> 04:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh by representative Fox
 
04:40:04.850 --> 04:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would be interested
 
04:40:06.410 --> 04:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
to know
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
um what the response the number or the
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
success of response for a person
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
receiving a contempt order versus a
 
04:40:20.448 --> 04:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
person receiving a threat of a license
 
04:40:22.850 --> 04:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
suspension so thank you for the question
 
04:40:24.890 --> 04:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know the answer it's a
 
04:40:25.788 --> 04:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
great question
 
04:40:27.770 --> 04:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
um I don't have that data if I can if I
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
can get it I'll be happy to pass along I
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
suspect I I may not be able to get it
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
if we discover through those numbers
 
04:40:43.010 --> 04:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
that contempt a threat of contempt is
 
04:40:46.130 --> 04:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
successful or more successful would that
 
04:40:49.070 --> 04:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
change your opinion
 
04:40:51.050 --> 04:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
no because
 
04:40:53.570 --> 04:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
um it would you know it may be relative
 
04:40:55.490 --> 04:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
the license is the more frequent
 
04:40:55.500 --> 04:40:57.708 align:start position:0%
the license is the more frequent
mechanism

04:40:57.708 --> 04:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:41:02.630 --> 04:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
um it you know the circumstances would
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
drive which mechanism is used
 
04:41:08.150 --> 04:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
um so the success or failure of one over
 
04:41:11.208 --> 04:41:11.218 align:start position:0%
the other is is sort of
 
04:41:16.330 --> 04:41:16.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:19.128 --> 04:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a question
 
04:41:20.750 --> 04:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question we we're testimony
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
that instead of a licensed suspension
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
that a bench warrant could be issued
 
04:41:28.430 --> 04:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
what's the difference in procedure
 
04:41:30.650 --> 04:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
between those two
 
04:41:33.170 --> 04:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
um a bench warrant a failure to to
 
04:41:35.208 --> 04:41:35.218 align:start position:0%
comply with a bench warrant has its own
 
04:41:35.218 --> 04:41:36.770 align:start position:0%
comply with a bench warrant has its own
consequences

04:41:36.770 --> 04:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
um including criminal
 
04:41:40.970 --> 04:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
um penalties so you know once you're
 
04:41:43.368 --> 04:41:43.378 align:start position:0%
getting into contempt bench warrants
 
04:41:46.430 --> 04:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
you're you're heading towards further
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
um the what we would perceive as the
 
04:41:50.400 --> 04:41:51.310 align:start position:0%
um the what we would perceive as the
license

04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:41:53.390 --> 04:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
suspension as being an administrative
 
04:41:57.350 --> 04:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
process one which there is
 
04:42:00.110 --> 04:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
an opportunity that's given with notice
 
04:42:03.170 --> 04:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
and if the notice is followed no
 
04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
consequences to the individual bench
 
04:42:07.250 --> 04:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
warrant being issued has consequences at
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:12.770 --> 04:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
any other questions okay representative
 
04:42:12.780 --> 04:42:13.850 align:start position:0%
any other questions okay representative
Sykes

04:42:13.850 --> 04:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
Sykes
 
04:42:15.770 --> 04:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for indulging me
 
04:42:18.288 --> 04:42:18.298 align:start position:0%
with a uh one more question and thank
 
04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
you sir for the same
 
04:42:22.788 --> 04:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious to know if you can tell
 
04:42:24.830 --> 04:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
me when the last time the judicial
 
04:42:24.840 --> 04:42:25.788 align:start position:0%
me when the last time the judicial
system

04:42:25.788 --> 04:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:42:29.390 --> 04:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
as a matter of In-House work took a look
 
04:42:31.128 --> 04:42:31.138 align:start position:0%
at the tools that they have in their
 
04:42:33.890 --> 04:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
toolbox and Wade
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
the relative merits of the of the tools
 
04:42:40.430 --> 04:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
that you have used or are not using
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
um it's fair question and similar I
 
04:42:43.670 --> 04:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
think to the other question if I can if
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
I can get an answer to that I'd be happy
 
04:42:49.128 --> 04:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
to I don't know as I say here today
 
04:42:52.730 --> 04:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you for the questions
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative Gorski thank you Mr
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:42:56.638 --> 04:42:57.708 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

04:42:57.708 --> 04:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
can you give me just a sense from the
 
04:43:00.590 --> 04:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
point where
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
let's say someone does sides not to pay
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
to the point just before they get we
 
04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
start getting into the court system
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
how long is that time are we talking
 
04:43:14.448 --> 04:43:14.458 align:start position:0%
weeks months
 
04:43:17.810 --> 04:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
so we imparted I apologize for saying
 
04:43:18.770 --> 04:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
this thank you for the question it
 
04:43:18.780 --> 04:43:19.910 align:start position:0%
this thank you for the question it
depends

04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
depends
 
04:43:22.670 --> 04:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
um if they're sort of sometimes they're
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
paying some and and so it could prolong
 
04:43:27.170 --> 04:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
sort of when you get to that point of
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
default so it really is when you get to
 
04:43:31.670 --> 04:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
that point of default you've ignored a
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
notice from the court it could be
 
04:43:37.490 --> 04:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
shortly after depending on what the what
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
the payment plan is that's been worked
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
out so if you're paying weekly monthly
 
04:43:44.208 --> 04:43:44.218 align:start position:0%
you know that will trigger the notices
 
04:43:46.250 --> 04:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
and then the subsequent default and then
 
04:43:49.010 --> 04:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
once the default is issued a copy of
 
04:43:50.810 --> 04:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
that gets sent to safety so I don't
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
think there's sort of a a pattern a
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
specific time frame that could that
 
04:43:57.708 --> 04:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
would flow from it so essentially you
 
04:44:00.050 --> 04:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
have the the initial order
 
04:44:02.390 --> 04:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
um that that assuming it's an order that
 
04:44:03.890 --> 04:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
came out of the Court
 
04:44:03.900 --> 04:44:05.350 align:start position:0%
came out of the Court
um

04:44:05.350 --> 04:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:08.208 --> 04:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
they're either paying it immediately or
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're setting up a payment plan that
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
payment plan sort of then dictates in
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
compliance with that payment plan then
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
dictates when they're no longer in
 
04:44:18.170 --> 04:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
compliance when they get the notice and
 
04:44:19.610 --> 04:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
then when ultimately the default is
 
04:44:19.620 --> 04:44:20.690 align:start position:0%
then when ultimately the default is
issued

04:44:20.690 --> 04:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
issued
 
04:44:25.010 --> 04:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:26.930 --> 04:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
one more
 
04:44:29.448 --> 04:44:29.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:44:33.170 --> 04:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
um if I were a person who was Levy
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
defined and discovered that my financial
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
situation has changed I'm not able to
 
04:44:41.170 --> 04:44:41.180 align:start position:0%
pay or I'm not able I need to make
 
04:44:45.050 --> 04:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
payments I would then have to petition
 
04:44:48.350 --> 04:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
the court have a hearing in order to
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
modify uh the fine in order to make
 
04:44:53.030 --> 04:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
those payments
 
04:44:55.250 --> 04:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
so two parts thank you for the question
 
04:44:57.170 --> 04:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
two parts to my answer if it's simply a
 
04:44:59.330 --> 04:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
modification of the payment plan that
 
04:45:00.650 --> 04:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
could be worked out through the clerk's
 
04:45:02.810 --> 04:45:02.820 align:start position:0%
office if it's a change in the actual
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
fine that would be through a judge
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
reviewing it and and deciding whether or
 
04:45:11.090 --> 04:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
not the fine order would be modified
 
04:45:13.368 --> 04:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
based on circumstances
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that could happen in that 30-day
 
04:45:15.360 --> 04:45:23.150 align:start position:0%
and that could happen in that 30-day
window

04:45:23.150 --> 04:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:25.010 --> 04:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
um so you know other questions thank you
 
04:45:26.570 --> 04:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
very much sir thank you and I apologize
 
04:45:28.490 --> 04:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
normally I would stay I have to head
 
04:45:29.930 --> 04:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
over to Children family law for a
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
hearing that's just about to start thank
 
04:45:33.530 --> 04:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
you again and any of that information if
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can find it would be appreciated
 
04:45:39.770 --> 04:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh chair recognizes
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hines
 
04:45:44.690 --> 04:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh also in support of the bill looking
 
04:45:49.570 --> 04:45:49.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.530 --> 04:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Dan Hines
 
04:45:53.330 --> 04:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
representing town of Belford and by way
 
04:45:54.890 --> 04:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
of background on criminal defense lawyer
 
04:45:56.448 --> 04:45:56.458 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I just want to
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
focus on is that people who go under
 
04:46:00.410 --> 04:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
suspension for
 
04:46:02.690 --> 04:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
um opera or people whose license going
 
04:46:04.490 --> 04:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
to suspension often do not know
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
um so we've heard testimony that gets
 
04:46:07.368 --> 04:46:07.378 align:start position:0%
mailed to them I've represented many
 
04:46:09.770 --> 04:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
people where that mail did not arrive in
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
some circumstances they might not have
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
updated their address quick enough with
 
04:46:15.050 --> 04:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
the DMB or in other circumstances the
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
mail just never arose
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
um it's sort of an endless thing where
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
if people one thing I see this common is
 
04:46:22.610 --> 04:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
so if you get a minor traffic violation
 
04:46:25.010 --> 04:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
such as speeding or Lane change or
 
04:46:26.330 --> 04:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
something like that it's up to the
 
04:46:27.770 --> 04:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
person on the ticket they have 30 days
 
04:46:30.410 --> 04:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
they can send it to the DMV saying I
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
plead not guilty and at some point DMV
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
um slowly sent us to the court who
 
04:46:38.030 --> 04:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
slowly sends it to people so it could be
 
04:46:39.770 --> 04:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
like six months down the line
 
04:46:41.208 --> 04:46:41.218 align:start position:0%
um people aren't really expecting court
 
04:46:42.530 --> 04:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
date and then they get a court date for
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
who knows how far down the line
 
04:46:47.150 --> 04:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
um so if people don't get that notice
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
they're not going to show up to court
 
04:46:50.208 --> 04:46:50.218 align:start position:0%
for that they are going to get defaulted
 
04:46:51.530 --> 04:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
they're going to get their license
 
04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
suspended which that letter presumably
 
04:46:56.208 --> 04:46:56.218 align:start position:0%
might go to an address that either they
 
04:46:58.010 --> 04:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
don't get or sometimes people might not
 
04:47:00.830 --> 04:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
get that for a various reasons and after
 
04:47:02.330 --> 04:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
after suspension if someone's found
 
04:47:04.368 --> 04:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
guilty has significant consequences last
 
04:47:06.170 --> 04:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
I checked the DMV can further suspend
 
04:47:08.090 --> 04:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
someone's license even once this is
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
cleared up there's default penalties Etc
 
04:47:13.610 --> 04:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
and it's significant points on a license
 
04:47:14.990 --> 04:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a major offense towards
 
04:47:16.910 --> 04:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
habitual offender law so New Hampshire
 
04:47:18.948 --> 04:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
takes three offenses to be habitual
 
04:47:20.208 --> 04:47:20.218 align:start position:0%
offender which is very serious
 
04:47:21.770 --> 04:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
consequences it's minimum one-year
 
04:47:23.810 --> 04:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
license loss up to four years and if
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
someone already had two major offenses
 
04:47:26.750 --> 04:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
in a five-year period this could be that
 
04:47:28.670 --> 04:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
third triggering thing that could force
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
them lose their license for a year so
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
um I when I in the past was a wrap by
 
04:47:36.050 --> 04:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
putting the bill it's required
 
04:47:37.910 --> 04:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
suspension layers to go out by certified
 
04:47:39.770 --> 04:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
mail the state opposed that because it
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
costs money
 
04:47:44.208 --> 04:47:44.218 align:start position:0%
um and my other uh response I'll happy
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
happy take any questions uh response to
 
04:47:47.810 --> 04:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative Fox's question I don't
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
think it's uniform throughout the courts
 
04:47:51.890 --> 04:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
about the time payment so I do agree
 
04:47:55.310 --> 04:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
generally the clerk will allow or set
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
time payments but in a case where a
 
04:47:59.810 --> 04:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
court or clerk didn't really want me
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
doing that over the counter they have me
 
04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
submit a motion that motion did have to
 
04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
get approved by the judge sometimes it's
 
04:48:07.490 --> 04:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
quick usually a state doesn't take
 
04:48:08.810 --> 04:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
possession on it I haven't really seen
 
04:48:10.730 --> 04:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
prosecutors checked people getting time
 
04:48:13.250 --> 04:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
payment plans but some courses don't act
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
on those timely uh just because a lot of
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
courts they're just overwhelmed and
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
judges aren't there every day so
 
04:48:23.390 --> 04:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
um I usually put in when it's due so the
 
04:48:25.250 --> 04:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
court can kind of get some urgency but I
 
04:48:26.570 --> 04:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
don't know that people representing
 
04:48:28.730 --> 04:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
themselves do that so
 
04:48:30.350 --> 04:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I do agree generally the clerk will
 
04:48:31.490 --> 04:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
do it but I don't think it's a uniform
 
04:48:31.500 --> 04:48:33.770 align:start position:0%
do it but I don't think it's a uniform
practice

04:48:33.770 --> 04:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
04:48:35.760 --> 04:48:37.310 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
having no one else to speak on House
 
04:48:45.530 --> 04:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 650 I want to close the public
 
04:48:45.540 --> 04:48:47.390 align:start position:0%
Bill 650 I want to close the public
hearing

04:48:47.390 --> 04:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:48:52.970 --> 04:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
will be hearing House Bill 388 at one
 
04:48:56.878 --> 04:48:58.190 align:start position:0%
will be hearing House Bill 388 at one
30.

04:48:58.190 --> 04:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
30.
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:50.040 --> 04:50:19.850 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:50:19.850 --> 04:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:23.940 --> 04:50:32.330 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:50:32.330 --> 04:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:44.030 --> 04:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
so it looks like the difference between
 
04:50:46.250 --> 04:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
years and Miles commercial right yes
 
04:50:46.260 --> 04:52:28.270 align:start position:0%
years and Miles commercial right yes
okay

04:52:28.270 --> 04:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay being at uh roughly 153 we'll open
 
04:52:36.310 --> 04:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
up the hearing on House Bill 388
 
04:52:39.170 --> 04:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
relative to the number of plates for
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles
 
04:52:43.190 --> 04:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes uh
 
04:52:46.430 --> 04:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh Dan Hines who is the
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh it's my name is
 
04:52:55.070 --> 04:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
Dan Hines representing Tana Belford and
 
04:52:57.410 --> 04:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
this bill would um
 
04:52:59.990 --> 04:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
basically allow people in private
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles to only have one
 
04:53:03.948 --> 04:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
plate displayed in the car that being
 
04:53:05.628 --> 04:53:05.638 align:start position:0%
the rear plate so it basically would
 
04:53:07.250 --> 04:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
eliminate the front plate requirement
 
04:53:10.670 --> 04:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
for private passenger vehicles and
 
04:53:12.288 --> 04:53:12.298 align:start position:0%
um I do have an amendment to this bill
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
that I recently emailed the committee
 
04:53:16.190 --> 04:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
that I just got back I did submit
 
04:53:19.128 --> 04:53:19.138 align:start position:0%
um a couple copies it's very brief I'll
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
address that in a second but so a
 
04:53:22.970 --> 04:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
private passenger vehicle is defined by
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
a statute um so this bill wouldn't apply
 
04:53:26.570 --> 04:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
to commercials it doesn't apply to buses
 
04:53:28.490 --> 04:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
it essentially reply to things people
 
04:53:31.368 --> 04:53:31.378 align:start position:0%
would consider a car but my Amendment to
 
04:53:34.128 --> 04:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
the bill is uh I saw the fiscal note for
 
04:53:35.690 --> 04:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
this and that this would cost the state
 
04:53:37.310 --> 04:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thousand dollars a year
 
04:53:39.830 --> 04:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
which I don't really like and the reason
 
04:53:42.770 --> 04:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
for that would be apparently If This
 
04:53:45.650 --> 04:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
Were to be enacted the way the state
 
04:53:47.930 --> 04:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
charges fees for plates is it's four
 
04:53:51.050 --> 04:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
dollars for plate so presumably
 
04:53:52.430 --> 04:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
um if they're still printing the same
 
04:53:53.868 --> 04:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
amount of plates but only collecting
 
04:53:55.730 --> 04:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
four dollars essentially that Revenue
 
04:53:58.610 --> 04:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
came out to 700 000 so my simple
 
04:54:01.610 --> 04:54:01.620 align:start position:0%
solution to do that is my Amendment says
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
that people pay the same eight dollars
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
um whether they get one plate or two
 
04:54:05.040 --> 04:54:06.050 align:start position:0%
um whether they get one plate or two
plates

04:54:06.050 --> 04:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
plates
 
04:54:08.330 --> 04:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so the revenue and that's
 
04:54:10.850 --> 04:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
um sense instance rather would remain
 
04:54:12.770 --> 04:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
the same if the state were to
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
practically do this in a way where
 
04:54:17.208 --> 04:54:17.218 align:start position:0%
they're not duplicating all the license
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
plates in duplicate it would actually
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
save the money um with our save the
 
04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
state money because the cost of
 
04:54:24.770 --> 04:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
producing would come down but the
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
revenue would come out the same so I
 
04:54:29.330 --> 04:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
think ultimately with that Amendment um
 
04:54:31.550 --> 04:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
it would have a positive fiscal
 
04:54:31.560 --> 04:54:32.270 align:start position:0%
it would have a positive fiscal
um

04:54:32.270 --> 04:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:34.490 --> 04:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
effect on the state not a negative one
 
04:54:37.128 --> 04:54:37.138 align:start position:0%
and so people might say why do we need
 
04:54:37.138 --> 04:54:38.030 align:start position:0%
and so people might say why do we need
this

04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:54:39.410 --> 04:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
um I guess one of my questions is why
 
04:54:42.288 --> 04:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
not so it's New Hampshire there's many
 
04:54:43.970 --> 04:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
states in the country who do not require
 
04:54:46.970 --> 04:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
a front plate Mass it's my understanding
 
04:54:48.890 --> 04:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
Mass sometimes that sometimes doesn't
 
04:54:51.170 --> 04:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
some understanding Vermont recently
 
04:54:52.730 --> 04:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
changed it so that you only need one
 
04:54:56.208 --> 04:54:56.218 align:start position:0%
many states just also have for a while
 
04:54:58.310 --> 04:54:58.320 align:start position:0%
only needed one
 
04:55:00.410 --> 04:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think there's been any
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
issues with that uh so I think the
 
04:55:05.448 --> 04:55:05.458 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill's been filed
 
04:55:07.190 --> 04:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
before and I think or a form of the
 
04:55:09.410 --> 04:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
spell this one is more limited than the
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
other ones
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
um but I think the opposition was
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
something that law enforcement can't
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
essentially see people or decide how to
 
04:55:17.990 --> 04:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
act and I just don't think
 
04:55:20.868 --> 04:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
impracticality that's how it works so if
 
04:55:22.850 --> 04:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
an officer is coming at someone in the
 
04:55:24.650 --> 04:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
other direction and they don't see a
 
04:55:26.448 --> 04:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
faceplate or front plate I would like to
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
know if the officer is turning on his
 
04:55:29.810 --> 04:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
lights at that point
 
04:55:31.250 --> 04:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
um because I think there's an issue with
 
04:55:33.650 --> 04:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
that one the officer can't know if that
 
04:55:34.970 --> 04:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
person is driving from State that
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't require plate and there's
 
04:55:37.788 --> 04:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
nothing illegal with those people
 
04:55:40.310 --> 04:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
driving in New Hampshire the officer
 
04:55:43.850 --> 04:55:43.860 align:start position:0%
can't tell at that point if someone has
 
04:55:46.430 --> 04:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
a template because those only go on the
 
04:55:49.368 --> 04:55:49.378 align:start position:0%
rear um paper so an officer could say
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
well I don't see a sticker he must be
 
04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire get behind turn on
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
his lights then by the time he gets
 
04:55:56.330 --> 04:55:56.340 align:start position:0%
behind the car you notice oops shouldn't
 
04:55:58.010 --> 04:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
stopped that person
 
04:55:59.330 --> 04:55:59.340 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think it's an issue
 
04:56:01.128 --> 04:56:01.138 align:start position:0%
particularly where it's my understanding
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
officers use essentially license
 
04:56:06.350 --> 04:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
identification or a plate essentially
 
04:56:10.430 --> 04:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
identification to sleep things that way
 
04:56:12.590 --> 04:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
um so that's I just don't think there's
 
04:56:13.730 --> 04:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
a harm in doing that but there are
 
04:56:16.550 --> 04:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
benefits so my car so recently got
 
04:56:19.550 --> 04:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
another Tesla but Tesla's do not by
 
04:56:22.910 --> 04:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
default have a good spot or a bracket
 
04:56:25.128 --> 04:56:25.138 align:start position:0%
for a front plate it's sort of
 
04:56:27.770 --> 04:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
Impractical for me to put one on there's
 
04:56:29.530 --> 04:56:29.540 align:start position:0%
some aftermarket things that people do
 
04:56:32.570 --> 04:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
but out of the factory it doesn't have
 
04:56:36.410 --> 04:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
that and the DMV he has sort of weird
 
04:56:39.948 --> 04:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
issues related to factory things but
 
04:56:42.410 --> 04:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding or I had an issue
 
04:56:44.208 --> 04:56:44.218 align:start position:0%
that when I try to get it inspected it's
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
a different rule than the law and it
 
04:56:47.208 --> 04:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
became a whole issue they didn't want to
 
04:56:48.650 --> 04:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
pass the car
 
04:56:51.410 --> 04:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
um so a separate issue but also front
 
04:56:53.330 --> 04:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
plates can decrease the value of certain
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
Vehicles particularly Imports or Exotics
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
or high ends where there just is not a
 
04:57:00.310 --> 04:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
plate and people are somehow
 
04:57:03.650 --> 04:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
retrofitting a plate in there and I
 
04:57:05.090 --> 04:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
think there is an environmental issue on
 
04:57:06.890 --> 04:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
this uh so particularly depending on the
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
car a lot of cars are designed
 
04:57:12.070 --> 04:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
especially nowadays they're designed for
 
04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
minimal it's an engineering thing to get
 
04:57:16.670 --> 04:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
the minimum wind resistance so depending
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
on where this front plate is if it's
 
04:57:19.788 --> 04:57:19.798 align:start position:0%
like if there's no spot for it
 
04:57:21.288 --> 04:57:21.298 align:start position:0%
particularly in like half of it's near
 
04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
the ground or something like that I
 
04:57:24.110 --> 04:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
think that can cause some issues
 
04:57:26.510 --> 04:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately leading to less fuel mileage
 
04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
so it might be minor still is a thing
 
04:57:31.310 --> 04:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
also more on the minor environmental
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
impact if we're producing less plates I
 
04:57:35.810 --> 04:57:35.820 align:start position:0%
think that's just the more valuable use
 
04:57:38.990 --> 04:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
of resources so I would ask that you
 
04:57:40.910 --> 04:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
adopt this and I'm happy to take any
 
04:57:40.920 --> 04:57:42.410 align:start position:0%
adopt this and I'm happy to take any
questions

04:57:42.410 --> 04:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Sinclair
 
04:57:49.250 --> 04:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
do you have an exact number of how many
 
04:57:54.530 --> 04:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
states there are that do not require
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
a front plate uh last subject I did
 
04:57:58.368 --> 04:57:58.378 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony to the
 
04:58:00.288 --> 04:58:00.298 align:start position:0%
committee however it was like late last
 
04:58:02.448 --> 04:58:02.458 align:start position:0%
night so I'll double check the number I
 
04:58:03.770 --> 04:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to give the wrong number I
 
04:58:05.628 --> 04:58:05.638 align:start position:0%
think it might have been around 10 or so
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
if I'm 20 okay 20.
 
04:58:10.430 --> 04:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:58:13.010 --> 04:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:58:14.930 --> 04:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
04:58:17.150 --> 04:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh the question I have uh
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
relates to people who put the uh covers
 
04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
over the plate
 
04:58:27.530 --> 04:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
that are supposedly transparent or
 
04:58:31.550 --> 04:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
whatever but that some of them are even
 
04:58:33.770 --> 04:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
intended so it's very hard to read what
 
04:58:37.610 --> 04:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
would you um would you want to comment
 
04:58:39.830 --> 04:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
on that is how that might relate to this
 
04:58:44.090 --> 04:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
bill yeah so I so uh I'm not changing
 
04:58:46.430 --> 04:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
the text of the present law where the
 
04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
last sentence says the plate shall be
 
04:58:49.730 --> 04:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
kept clean so I suggest that that
 
04:58:51.470 --> 04:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't comply with that there are also
 
04:58:53.090 --> 04:58:53.100 align:start position:0%
department of safety rules that address
 
04:58:55.190 --> 04:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
that on the transparency
 
04:58:57.770 --> 04:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
um so this wouldn't affect that at all
 
04:58:59.448 --> 04:58:59.458 align:start position:0%
if I guess if they aren't required to
 
04:59:01.128 --> 04:59:01.138 align:start position:0%
have a front plate yes if they want to
 
04:59:03.230 --> 04:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
put one and make it less than 100
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
readable it wouldn't be a violation but
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
if they were to keep their rear plate in
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
such a fashion where it's not
 
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
transparent dirty or something like that
 
04:59:13.010 --> 04:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
that would still be illegal If This Were
 
04:59:15.788 --> 04:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:19.788 --> 04:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative Staub
 
04:59:26.090 --> 04:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:28.250 --> 04:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
still go through the toll booth and uh
 
04:59:30.350 --> 04:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
did does the reader read the license
 
04:59:33.230 --> 04:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
plate there and how would that work if
 
04:59:34.788 --> 04:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
you didn't have a license plate on the
 
04:59:36.890 --> 04:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
front of your vehicle yep so it's my
 
04:59:38.448 --> 04:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
understanding the New Hampshire Easy
 
04:59:39.948 --> 04:59:39.958 align:start position:0%
Pass they have cameras it's my
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
understanding the cameras only pick up
 
04:59:43.490 --> 04:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
the rear plate uh so if someone from the
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
state wants to correct that but that's
 
04:59:46.250 --> 04:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
my understanding so I don't think this
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.010 --> 04:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.970 --> 05:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair would like to
 
05:00:01.980 --> 05:00:03.530 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair would like to
recognize

05:00:03.530 --> 05:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
05:00:05.090 --> 05:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
um Michael Granger
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
who would like to speak for two minutes
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.910 --> 05:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
05:00:19.070 --> 05:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh if I'm I'm going to be
 
05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
discussing something a little bit
 
05:00:21.650 --> 05:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
different than front license plate but
 
05:00:23.150 --> 05:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
it relates to the front license plates
 
05:00:25.390 --> 05:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
if you read RSA chapter
 
05:00:28.368 --> 05:00:28.378 align:start position:0%
261-75 it states the following quote
 
05:00:30.410 --> 05:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
the director may make special rules
 
05:00:32.090 --> 05:00:32.100 align:start position:0%
relative to the number of plates the
 
05:00:34.490 --> 05:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
location of said plate or plates on the
 
05:00:36.110 --> 05:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle and the material and design
 
05:00:38.270 --> 05:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
thereof end quote so that's the existing
 
05:00:41.090 --> 05:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
law the reason I bring attention to this
 
05:00:42.830 --> 05:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
is because the people are becoming
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
increasingly concerned about the
 
05:00:46.250 --> 05:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority of unelected
 
05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
government employees as such it seems
 
05:00:50.090 --> 05:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate to limit rulemaking
 
05:00:51.708 --> 05:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
Authority as much as possible unless
 
05:00:53.570 --> 05:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
there's a really compelling reason to
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
give an unelected person the right to
 
05:00:58.850 --> 05:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
make rules that can result in monetary
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
fines so the text of the current
 
05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
legislation gives broad rule making
 
05:01:05.090 --> 05:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
power to the director the director is
 
05:01:07.550 --> 05:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
Not Elected there are fines for failing
 
05:01:10.010 --> 05:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
to abide by the rules so this scenario
 
05:01:12.050 --> 05:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
results in citizenry getting fined due
 
05:01:13.250 --> 05:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
to the actions of people who are not
 
05:01:14.750 --> 05:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
themselves elected
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh this is counter to the spirit of
 
05:01:18.770 --> 05:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
representative government it may seem
 
05:01:21.288 --> 05:01:21.298 align:start position:0%
minor but in if people are more
 
05:01:22.850 --> 05:01:22.860 align:start position:0%
concerned about this nowadays than they
 
05:01:25.070 --> 05:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
have in the past so it would be a step
 
05:01:26.990 --> 05:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
in the right direction to sort of
 
05:01:29.628 --> 05:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
take whatever power that is uh you know
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
anything that results in monetary fines
 
05:01:34.128 --> 05:01:34.138 align:start position:0%
against citizens and if possible put it
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
in with the legislature so that it's uh
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
their representatives that are making
 
05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
that sort of decision and uh not uh
 
05:01:43.490 --> 05:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
government employees uh making up the
 
05:01:46.070 --> 05:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
decision there so that is why I request
 
05:01:49.430 --> 05:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
you vote OTP on this bill
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
05:01:54.050 --> 05:01:54.060 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:01:55.850 --> 05:01:55.860 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you representative
 
05:02:00.470 --> 05:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:01.970 --> 05:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
chair at this point would like to
 
05:02:04.730 --> 05:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
recognize John Cochran from the New
 
05:02:06.350 --> 05:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire D.O.T
 
05:02:23.030 --> 05:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:24.590 --> 05:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
05:02:26.750 --> 05:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is John Corcoran
 
05:02:28.550 --> 05:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm the ministry of the Bureau of
 
05:02:30.890 --> 05:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
turnpikes and for the New Hampshire
 
05:02:33.708 --> 05:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
D.O.T the department has concerns with
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
the proposed Bill requiring one license
 
05:02:37.550 --> 05:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
plate and passenger vehicle
 
05:02:40.010 --> 05:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
this problem presents mainly with our
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
toll system the front license plate will
 
05:02:44.510 --> 05:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
no longer be required and no longer be
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
available for us to capture a violation
 
05:02:48.470 --> 05:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
capture image with our violation
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement system which allows us to
 
05:02:53.570 --> 05:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
collect toll from the customers who
 
05:02:55.610 --> 05:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
don't have a transponder
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
as you know the turnpike system is
 
05:03:00.050 --> 05:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
critical to the dot and the state's
 
05:03:02.090 --> 05:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
Transportation Network it operates under
 
05:03:04.610 --> 05:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
an Easy Pass system and that consists of
 
05:03:08.030 --> 05:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
35 toll agencies 19 states to provide
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
seamless efficient effective ways to
 
05:03:12.170 --> 05:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
collect toll from in-state reticent
 
05:03:13.850 --> 05:03:13.860 align:start position:0%
residents and out of state residents
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
particularly for open road Towing and
 
05:03:18.410 --> 05:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
All Electronics only
 
05:03:20.570 --> 05:03:20.580 align:start position:0%

all the revenue from the turnpike system
 
05:03:41.510 --> 05:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
goes right back into the turnpike system
 
05:03:44.590 --> 05:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
last year in fiscal year 22 we collected
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
122 million of toll Revenue which is
 
05:03:51.110 --> 05:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
about 112 million transactions of those
 
05:03:53.448 --> 05:03:53.458 align:start position:0%
transactions where no transponder was
 
05:03:55.730 --> 05:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
read the license plate of the vehicles
 
05:03:59.230 --> 05:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
captured resulted in 13 million 500
 
05:04:01.550 --> 05:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
acceptable images
 
05:04:04.610 --> 05:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
of those acceptable images are Easy Pass
 
05:04:08.448 --> 05:04:08.458 align:start position:0%
back office provide uh vendor use 53
 
05:04:10.490 --> 05:04:10.500 align:start position:0%
percent of those were from the front

license plate
 
05:04:14.810 --> 05:04:14.820 align:start position:0%
for a night an image toll which is
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
matching up the license plate to a
 
05:04:18.770 --> 05:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
person's Easy Pass account a seven day
 
05:04:20.990 --> 05:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
to pay account license plate account or
 
05:04:23.868 --> 05:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
for invoice processing
 
05:04:25.970 --> 05:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
it is very concerning the dot with a
 
05:04:28.250 --> 05:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
high potential Revenue loss of a of a
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
front license plate no longer required
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
the department relies on the
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
availability of both plates to provide
 
05:04:38.750 --> 05:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
the highest capture rate of the license
 
05:04:42.650 --> 05:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
plate many times on rear license plates
 
05:04:45.770 --> 05:04:45.780 align:start position:0%
they are blocked by bike racks trailers
 
05:04:49.490 --> 05:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
and other apparatuses also a lot of
 
05:04:51.410 --> 05:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
times on the license plates there's snow
 
05:04:53.530 --> 05:04:53.540 align:start position:0%
on them mud on them debris on them
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it depends on a time of the
 
05:04:58.610 --> 05:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
year and a camera angle we lose license
 
05:05:03.170 --> 05:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
plates images cut a sun glare
 
05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
um all these blocked images or
 
05:05:07.368 --> 05:05:07.378 align:start position:0%
unreadable images is lost toll Revenue
 
05:05:08.690 --> 05:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
to us
 
05:05:10.550 --> 05:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to have redundancy to read
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
each of front and rear is maximize our
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
collection of toll Revenue
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
when the valid transponder is not read
 
05:05:18.050 --> 05:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
in the lanes
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
in addition to these reasons we also
 
05:05:24.050 --> 05:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
have 36 Lanes out in our toll plaza that
 
05:05:26.448 --> 05:05:26.458 align:start position:0%
do not have rear cameras so this would
 
05:05:28.970 --> 05:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
cost us additional four hundred thousand
 
05:05:30.948 --> 05:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
dollars to install cameras in those
 
05:05:30.958 --> 05:05:33.770 align:start position:0%
dollars to install cameras in those
Lanes

05:05:33.770 --> 05:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
Lanes
 
05:05:36.288 --> 05:05:36.298 align:start position:0%
this concludes my testimony and I'm open
 
05:05:39.288 --> 05:05:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:41.390 --> 05:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:05:43.850 --> 05:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
committee representative sellers
 
05:05:45.590 --> 05:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:05:47.570 --> 05:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
so if you have 36 Lanes I'd only read
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
license plates and other states only
 
05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
have rare license plates they're getting
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
through free is that true or not those
 
05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
are typically in our cash lanes that are
 
05:05:59.690 --> 05:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
only the front license plates and we use
 
05:06:01.310 --> 05:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
those a lot for the no funds because we
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
send them an invoice so usually there's
 
05:06:08.410 --> 05:06:08.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:10.550 --> 05:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you and I will want to follow
 
05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
up I just want to be clear because he
 
05:06:16.550 --> 05:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
asked a very good question so you're
 
05:06:19.788 --> 05:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
saying that the the toll Gates or the
 
05:06:22.250 --> 05:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
the tolls that
 
05:06:24.350 --> 05:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
only read the back that don't read the
 
05:06:25.610 --> 05:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
back those are where there's an
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
attendant yes those are where there's a
 
05:06:28.080 --> 05:06:29.570 align:start position:0%
attendant yes those are where there's a
tendon

05:06:29.570 --> 05:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
tendon
 
05:06:31.610 --> 05:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
good reason for keeping the attendance I
 
05:06:33.948 --> 05:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
guess that's a statement
 
05:06:33.958 --> 05:06:36.250 align:start position:0%
guess that's a statement
um

05:06:36.250 --> 05:06:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
we know how many of these vehicles are
 
05:06:40.250 --> 05:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
coming into this state where there's
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
only one plate are you suggesting that
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
the state is losing an awful lot of
 
05:06:47.448 --> 05:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
money due to sun glare snow bicycle
 
05:06:49.490 --> 05:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
racks that sort of stuff on on these
 
05:06:51.770 --> 05:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
automatic tolls
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have a potential losing the money
 
05:06:55.910 --> 05:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
with because a lot of times in the back
 
05:06:58.490 --> 05:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
the rear license plate the bike racks
 
05:06:59.810 --> 05:06:59.820 align:start position:0%
and stuff
 
05:07:01.788 --> 05:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
um block the license plate so we utilize
 
05:07:05.208 --> 05:07:05.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:07.310 --> 05:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
I you didn't answer my question so are
 
05:07:08.930 --> 05:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
you suggesting that we're losing a lot
 
05:07:10.970 --> 05:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
of money is what I'm asking the state
 
05:07:13.128 --> 05:07:13.138 align:start position:0%
not right now because we collect both
 
05:07:16.690 --> 05:07:16.700 align:start position:0%
front and rear license plates oh
 
05:07:19.490 --> 05:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
from states that only have one license
 
05:07:22.510 --> 05:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
plate in the rear
 
05:07:24.830 --> 05:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
we could be losing I don't think there's
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
that many states that travel in New
 
05:07:27.770 --> 05:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have the one license
 
05:07:27.780 --> 05:07:31.550 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that have the one license
plate

05:07:31.550 --> 05:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:35.510 --> 05:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:37.550 --> 05:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Coker thank you Mr
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
chairman um do you do you have like an
 
05:07:42.530 --> 05:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
have you guys done an estimate I mean do
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
you have this statistics on like when
 
05:07:47.208 --> 05:07:47.218 align:start position:0%
like how much you might lose or is this
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
just kind of a best guess
 
05:07:52.368 --> 05:07:52.378 align:start position:0%
um our Easy Pass back office vendor out
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
of all the images they review they take
 
05:07:56.690 --> 05:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
usually the best image and stuff and 50
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
of them fits through Center out of the
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
front license plate we use the front
 
05:08:02.570 --> 05:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
license plate majority of the time but
 
05:08:04.330 --> 05:08:04.340 align:start position:0%
if the front license plate was
 
05:08:06.890 --> 05:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
unavailable would you lose that other
 
05:08:08.810 --> 05:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
person would losing majority of that
 
05:08:12.050 --> 05:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
money so like a state like Florida which
 
05:08:13.550 --> 05:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
only ha you know doesn't have the front
 
05:08:15.948 --> 05:08:15.958 align:start position:0%
license plate they're losing 50 of the
 
05:08:18.170 --> 05:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
revenue through or do they have
 
05:08:20.090 --> 05:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
different technology that makes it
 
05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
easier to capture the rear plate I mean
 
05:08:25.250 --> 05:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about Florida system so
 
05:08:25.260 --> 05:08:28.010 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about Florida system so
okay

05:08:28.010 --> 05:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.010 --> 05:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
representative C
 
05:08:35.628 --> 05:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with uh the uh
 
05:08:41.030 --> 05:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
plastic covers that some people put over
 
05:08:42.530 --> 05:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
license plates
 
05:08:44.628 --> 05:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
does that interfere with the cameras
 
05:08:46.730 --> 05:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
being able to read them
 
05:08:48.890 --> 05:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
it doesn't interfere with taking
 
05:08:50.570 --> 05:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
pictures of the cameras but sometimes
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
those do block the license plate numbers
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
in the state and it's hard to read those
 
05:08:54.958 --> 05:08:58.970 align:start position:0%
in the state and it's hard to read those
too

05:08:58.970 --> 05:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:02.448 --> 05:09:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:04.910 --> 05:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you sir for
 
05:09:08.150 --> 05:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
05:09:11.570 --> 05:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
do we have available a list of the
 
05:09:15.050 --> 05:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
states that only require a rear-facing
 
05:09:18.590 --> 05:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
plate because there's some I I don't
 
05:09:21.410 --> 05:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
know what those states are
 
05:09:24.410 --> 05:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
all I know is um I read an article on
 
05:09:26.930 --> 05:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania Turnpike when they went all
 
05:09:29.448 --> 05:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
electronic tolling they're having a big
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
issue because the only issue they don't
 
05:09:32.628 --> 05:09:32.638 align:start position:0%
have front license plates and they're
 
05:09:34.730 --> 05:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
trying to go to their legislation to
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
change it to two license plate because
 
05:09:38.030 --> 05:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
they're losing a lot of money and in
 
05:09:40.128 --> 05:09:40.138 align:start position:0%
that article it said they were one of 18
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:48.070 --> 05:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
but yes as a follow-up then uh if
 
05:09:53.208 --> 05:09:53.218 align:start position:0%
someone has that information it looks
 
05:09:54.770 --> 05:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
like somebody's looking for it just get
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
make it available to the committee
 
05:09:56.160 --> 05:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
make it available to the committee
please

05:09:57.110 --> 05:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
please
 
05:09:59.690 --> 05:09:59.700 align:start position:0%

05:10:10.670 --> 05:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
chair like to recognize uh John drewery
 
05:10:14.990 --> 05:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
who is requesting uh four minutes and he
 
05:10:20.570 --> 05:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:20.580 --> 05:10:21.770 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

foreign
 
05:10:24.050 --> 05:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and members
 
05:10:25.610 --> 05:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
of the committee for taking the time to
 
05:10:27.590 --> 05:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
listen to me uh this is the third year
 
05:10:29.570 --> 05:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
in a row you've uh that I've been here
 
05:10:31.310 --> 05:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
05:10:36.288 --> 05:10:36.298 align:start position:0%
um and uh I retired uh last May
 
05:10:38.690 --> 05:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and was out to pasture and this bill
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
means so much to me to
 
05:10:43.250 --> 05:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
um to oppose it because of the way it
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
helps law enforcement so much that I
 
05:10:47.690 --> 05:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
came back to testify today and on behalf
 
05:10:49.970 --> 05:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
of you and I appreciate the honor uh to
 
05:10:51.170 --> 05:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
do so on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of Police Association
 
05:10:56.570 --> 05:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
I have provided you with written packets
 
05:10:58.128 --> 05:10:58.138 align:start position:0%
um that's probably similar to the ones
 
05:11:00.830 --> 05:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
you've had in your past years past if
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
you would like to shorten my testimony
 
05:11:06.590 --> 05:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm obviously opposing HP 388 as well
 
05:11:10.430 --> 05:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
as HB 393 in my written testimony but
 
05:11:11.868 --> 05:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to stay for the
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon for you to testify on the
 
05:11:16.850 --> 05:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
later bill that the pleasure of of the
 
05:11:16.860 --> 05:11:18.128 align:start position:0%
later bill that the pleasure of of the
committee

05:11:18.128 --> 05:11:18.138 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to bore you with
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
repeating my written testimony it is
 
05:11:27.288 --> 05:11:27.298 align:start position:0%
riveting testimony that will put you to
 
05:11:28.510 --> 05:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
sleep tonight
 
05:11:32.030 --> 05:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
but a few of the highlights are I'm a
 
05:11:34.550 --> 05:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
car guy I like cars I've got some grease
 
05:11:36.410 --> 05:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
under my nails
 
05:11:39.650 --> 05:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
um and uh I just like the front play
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
but it is so important for law
 
05:11:46.070 --> 05:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement in my career I was a member
 
05:11:48.288 --> 05:11:48.298 align:start position:0%
of the regional accident reconstruction
 
05:11:48.298 --> 05:11:49.850 align:start position:0%
of the regional accident reconstruction
team

05:11:49.850 --> 05:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
team
 
05:11:51.650 --> 05:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
um I must admit to you that I love front
 
05:11:53.628 --> 05:11:53.638 align:start position:0%
license plates
 
05:11:56.390 --> 05:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
um over the years it has made my job so
 
05:12:01.850 --> 05:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
much easier Route 11 uh 75 and 153 are
 
05:12:03.288 --> 05:12:03.298 align:start position:0%
main state roads that run through
 
05:12:03.298 --> 05:12:05.448 align:start position:0%
main state roads that run through
Farmington

05:12:05.448 --> 05:12:05.458 align:start position:0%
Farmington
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh when neighboring police
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
departments would issue a be on the
 
05:12:11.150 --> 05:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
lookout for it was so much easier just
 
05:12:13.550 --> 05:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to find the right car looking
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
for that front plate instead of trying
 
05:12:17.810 --> 05:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
to turn a cruiser across the road to get
 
05:12:21.170 --> 05:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
a visual a lot of the cars
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
um have the recess part of the real
 
05:12:25.510 --> 05:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
license plates
 
05:12:27.948 --> 05:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
as one of my colleagues just testified
 
05:12:29.930 --> 05:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
too and it's tough to get a view on that
 
05:12:31.610 --> 05:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
as they sit back underneath the trunk
 
05:12:31.620 --> 05:12:32.530 align:start position:0%
as they sit back underneath the trunk
lid

05:12:32.530 --> 05:12:32.540 align:start position:0%
lid
 
05:12:36.110 --> 05:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
the crimes that we've solved are
 
05:12:38.390 --> 05:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
numerous I found front license plates at
 
05:12:40.390 --> 05:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
many accident scenes
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
we had them imprinted on other vehicles
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it was perfect on a hit and run case
 
05:12:47.868 --> 05:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
where that license plate is right there
 
05:12:49.610 --> 05:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
on the bumper of the other vehicle and
 
05:12:51.708 --> 05:12:51.718 align:start position:0%
the person had taken off and it gives us
 
05:12:54.410 --> 05:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
a wonderful starting point I even had it
 
05:12:56.868 --> 05:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
on the vinyl siding of a house where
 
05:12:58.850 --> 05:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
someone had gone across lost control of
 
05:13:01.730 --> 05:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
their vehicle went across a lawn hit a
 
05:13:03.650 --> 05:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
house and there was that front license
 
05:13:05.810 --> 05:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
plate imprinted on the vinyl siding of
 
05:13:06.550 --> 05:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
the house
 
05:13:08.930 --> 05:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
and it just made our lives so much
 
05:13:08.940 --> 05:13:10.490 align:start position:0%
and it just made our lives so much
easier

05:13:10.490 --> 05:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
easier
 
05:13:10.500 --> 05:13:11.030 align:start position:0%
easier
um

05:13:11.030 --> 05:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
um you know looking at at nice cars and
 
05:13:17.690 --> 05:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
and I had the pleasure of purchasing a a
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
nice hard top convertible that I had to
 
05:13:21.770 --> 05:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
drill two holes in to put my front
 
05:13:23.890 --> 05:13:23.900 align:start position:0%
license plate on but I proudly did it
 
05:13:27.708 --> 05:13:27.718 align:start position:0%
because I stand behind that so much that
 
05:13:29.570 --> 05:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
it just helped us out so much over the
 
05:13:29.580 --> 05:13:30.830 align:start position:0%
it just helped us out so much over the
year

05:13:30.830 --> 05:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:13:32.570 --> 05:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire license plates are
 
05:13:35.050 --> 05:13:35.060 align:start position:0%
reflective they stand out really well
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
you could see them coming and and I
 
05:13:39.948 --> 05:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
challenge you during the evening as you
 
05:13:42.170 --> 05:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
drive home take a peek at the oncoming
 
05:13:43.788 --> 05:13:43.798 align:start position:0%
cars and you'll see how well that New
 
05:13:45.708 --> 05:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license plate stands out to be
 
05:13:47.690 --> 05:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
able to be read
 
05:13:47.700 --> 05:13:48.350 align:start position:0%
able to be read
um

05:13:48.350 --> 05:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:50.690 --> 05:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
you know we've had cars involved in
 
05:13:55.550 --> 05:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
robberies the car would pull into a
 
05:13:57.350 --> 05:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
business and the cameras of the
 
05:13:59.390 --> 05:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
convenience store or the grocery store
 
05:14:01.490 --> 05:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh was able to capture that front
 
05:14:04.010 --> 05:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
license plate for us uh had it only been
 
05:14:06.470 --> 05:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
a real license plate we would have just
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
had a description of a car to go on
 
05:14:09.480 --> 05:14:10.368 align:start position:0%
had a description of a car to go on
um

05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:12.288 --> 05:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:14:14.990 --> 05:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
as my colleague said at the tolls
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
um you know it I think it would cost the
 
05:14:18.590 --> 05:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
state some money to lose the front
 
05:14:20.350 --> 05:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
license plate
 
05:14:22.610 --> 05:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
aerodynamically speaking I've been
 
05:14:24.170 --> 05:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
blessed with two children that are both
 
05:14:26.570 --> 05:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
engineers and one that married an
 
05:14:27.890 --> 05:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
engineer who's currently doing her
 
05:14:30.530 --> 05:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
doctorate at MIT in speaking with them
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
the aerodynamics of the wind resistance
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
of having a front plate and removing
 
05:14:38.030 --> 05:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
that front plate is is very negligible
 
05:14:40.550 --> 05:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
and in my written testimony of I've
 
05:14:42.110 --> 05:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
outlined that but I don't want to bore
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
you with that that information
 
05:14:45.480 --> 05:14:46.610 align:start position:0%
you with that that information
um

05:14:46.610 --> 05:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:48.590 --> 05:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
just in looking over some of the high
 
05:14:48.600 --> 05:14:50.750 align:start position:0%
just in looking over some of the high
points

05:14:50.750 --> 05:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
points
 
05:14:54.230 --> 05:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
I provided you some documentation of you
 
05:14:55.850 --> 05:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
know how that front plate does look on a
 
05:14:58.910 --> 05:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
car there is universal light Universal
 
05:15:00.890 --> 05:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
license plate relocators that can be
 
05:15:00.900 --> 05:15:02.030 align:start position:0%
license plate relocators that can be
used

05:15:02.030 --> 05:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:15:03.530 --> 05:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
um basically you pop out the little tow
 
05:15:06.050 --> 05:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
hook and the bracket fits right onto
 
05:15:08.930 --> 05:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
there to keep the license plate from
 
05:15:11.410 --> 05:15:11.420 align:start position:0%
having to add holes into your vehicle
 
05:15:13.730 --> 05:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
a news update from the Department of
 
05:15:15.310 --> 05:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
Justice and the AG
 
05:15:19.570 --> 05:15:19.580 align:start position:0%
goes into on the last page of it
 
05:15:22.190 --> 05:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
a vehicle that was involved in The
 
05:15:24.310 --> 05:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
Disappearance of Harmony Montgomery
 
05:15:27.288 --> 05:15:27.298 align:start position:0%
was that the real license plate happened
 
05:15:29.810 --> 05:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
to be a skew and helped lead some
 
05:15:31.550 --> 05:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
information into that and I provided you
 
05:15:33.970 --> 05:15:33.980 align:start position:0%
that documentation as well
 
05:15:37.550 --> 05:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the Vermont retailers Association
 
05:15:40.190 --> 05:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
at Grocers uh actually opposed their
 
05:15:41.690 --> 05:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
bill and I think they went to a
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
one-plate state at one point and have
 
05:15:45.890 --> 05:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
now gone back to a two-plate state I I
 
05:15:49.010 --> 05:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
believe they are a two plate State now
 
05:15:51.410 --> 05:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and then in the written testimony
 
05:15:51.420 --> 05:15:52.910 align:start position:0%
um and then in the written testimony
there

05:15:52.910 --> 05:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:15:54.890 --> 05:15:54.900 align:start position:0%
um they just say the majority of the
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
thefts occurring
 
05:15:58.368 --> 05:15:58.378 align:start position:0%
um and the uses of two license plates
 
05:16:00.410 --> 05:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
increases the opportunity of catching
 
05:16:02.690 --> 05:16:02.700 align:start position:0%
perpetrators later
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to bore you with uh with
 
05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
highlighting my written testimony and I
 
05:16:09.050 --> 05:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciate the opportunity to uh
 
05:16:11.208 --> 05:16:11.218 align:start position:0%
come out of my past year and come before

you today on a topic that is uh it just
 
05:16:15.470 --> 05:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
is so incredibly important to my heart
 
05:16:17.570 --> 05:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
even though I hate putting two holes in
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
a bumper of a car
 
05:16:21.770 --> 05:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
um it just helps us out so greatly
 
05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
um and I'd be more than happy to take
 
05:16:25.250 --> 05:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have and

sure

05:16:55.430 --> 05:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:16:56.810 --> 05:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
does include
 
05:16:58.368 --> 05:16:58.378 align:start position:0%
some information that was provided by
 
05:16:59.868 --> 05:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
the national Sheriff's Association in
 
05:16:59.878 --> 05:17:01.550 align:start position:0%
the national Sheriff's Association in
2016.

05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
2016.
 
05:17:03.230 --> 05:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officials are charged
 
05:17:05.090 --> 05:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
with numerous responsibilities including
 
05:17:06.530 --> 05:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of laws that frequently
 
05:17:08.090 --> 05:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
involve the use of motor vehicles and
 
05:17:10.250 --> 05:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
other equipment Motor Vehicles are used
 
05:17:11.990 --> 05:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
in 70 percent of all the serious crimes
 
05:17:13.550 --> 05:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
committed in the United States and the
 
05:17:15.590 --> 05:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
quick discovery of such Vehicles can
 
05:17:17.570 --> 05:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
help solve such crimes
 
05:17:19.490 --> 05:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
traffic enforcement activities including
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the use of automated license plate
 
05:17:23.030 --> 05:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
readers have proved invaluable in the
 
05:17:24.470 --> 05:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
detection and apprehension of
 
05:17:26.810 --> 05:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
individuals involved in crimes or
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
potential potential terrorist activities
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
all means of initial identification
 
05:17:33.050 --> 05:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
including front and rear reflective
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
license plates are essential
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
front and rear fully reflective license
 
05:17:39.288 --> 05:17:39.298 align:start position:0%
plates are a key component of quickly
 
05:17:42.050 --> 05:17:42.060 align:start position:0%
and accurately identifying vehicles I
 
05:17:43.430 --> 05:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
have personally been involved in a
 
05:17:45.470 --> 05:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
number of homicide investigations in
 
05:17:47.570 --> 05:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
which the suspect has fled the state and
 
05:17:49.550 --> 05:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
had not been and had it not been for a
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
license plate reader the discovery of
 
05:17:53.150 --> 05:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
the suspect's location would have been
 
05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
significantly delayed the lack of having
 
05:17:57.830 --> 05:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
a front plate makes that Discovery much
 
05:17:59.330 --> 05:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
05:18:01.610 --> 05:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
conversely I recall a fatal hit and run
 
05:18:03.050 --> 05:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
investigation where we were able to
 
05:18:04.850 --> 05:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
gather a few high quality surveillance
 
05:18:08.090 --> 05:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
videos of the suspect vehicle in this
 
05:18:09.650 --> 05:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
case the vehicle was not displaying a
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
front license plate this had a great
 
05:18:13.368 --> 05:18:13.378 align:start position:0%
impact on the investigation as not only
 
05:18:15.650 --> 05:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
could we not identify the vehicle we
 
05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't conclude the state in which the
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle was registered this
 
05:18:21.110 --> 05:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
significantly impacted the time it took
 
05:18:23.510 --> 05:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
to identify the vehicle and its driver
 
05:18:25.368 --> 05:18:25.378 align:start position:0%
time which can be used to falsify or
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
hide evidence or Worse commit further
 
05:18:29.570 --> 05:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
crimes and impact Public Safety
 
05:18:31.368 --> 05:18:31.378 align:start position:0%
even without the benefit of quantitative
 
05:18:32.810 --> 05:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
data related to license plate
 
05:18:34.430 --> 05:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
identification it is reasonable to
 
05:18:36.170 --> 05:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
conclude that the use of front and rear
 
05:18:37.850 --> 05:18:37.860 align:start position:0%
license plate increased the probability
 
05:18:39.948 --> 05:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
to accurately identifying a motor
 
05:18:41.510 --> 05:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle in multiple and diverse
 
05:18:41.520 --> 05:18:42.650 align:start position:0%
vehicle in multiple and diverse
situations

05:18:42.650 --> 05:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
situations
 
05:18:44.330 --> 05:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony I'll take any
 
05:18:44.340 --> 05:18:45.708 align:start position:0%
concludes my testimony I'll take any
questions

05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:18:47.628 --> 05:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from the
 
05:18:50.270 --> 05:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
committee representative sellers thank
 
05:18:51.770 --> 05:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
05:18:54.410 --> 05:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
is this your testimony or coming from
 
05:18:56.690 --> 05:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
the state police
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's coming from the state police I'm
 
05:19:00.890 --> 05:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
conveying it from State Police the
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
personal uh stories that I shared were
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
mine okay thank you
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:19:10.310 --> 05:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
not seeing any oh
 
05:19:13.128 --> 05:19:13.138 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair
 
05:19:15.890 --> 05:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
I have to give them full attention
 
05:19:15.900 --> 05:19:16.690 align:start position:0%
I have to give them full attention
um

05:19:16.690 --> 05:19:16.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:18.830 --> 05:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
knowing that State Police agencies
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
across the country all work together
 
05:19:22.610 --> 05:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
we're exchanging ideas and stuff like
 
05:19:25.850 --> 05:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
that do you have any idea how it is that
 
05:19:28.610 --> 05:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
I guess now 21 states in the country
 
05:19:30.770 --> 05:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
only have the one license plate in the
 
05:19:32.990 --> 05:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
back and that's not that not only
 
05:19:34.970 --> 05:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
includes States like Florida but now I
 
05:19:37.550 --> 05:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
hear Ohio is just dropped there so I'm
 
05:19:39.230 --> 05:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
just wondering what the the Scuttle is
 
05:19:41.150 --> 05:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
between all of State Police agencies
 
05:19:43.010 --> 05:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
with regards to that thank you
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair I appreciate the
 
05:19:44.280 --> 05:19:45.170 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair I appreciate the
question

05:19:45.170 --> 05:19:45.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:19:46.368 --> 05:19:46.378 align:start position:0%
um I don't unfortunately have any
 
05:19:47.690 --> 05:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
information to share with you about that
 
05:19:48.890 --> 05:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
I haven't had discussions with other
 
05:19:50.750 --> 05:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
state police police agencies regarding
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
that but I do know because I recall that
 
05:19:55.910 --> 05:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts did at one point in time
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
become a two-plate state so I did make
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
an inquiry to the state and uh they did
 
05:20:02.690 --> 05:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
confirm that in 1987 they did move from
 
05:20:05.750 --> 05:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
a single to a dual plate in order to
 
05:20:08.390 --> 05:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
support law enforcement so that's the
 
05:20:10.430 --> 05:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
only state that I'm aware of
 
05:20:12.288 --> 05:20:12.298 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question any further
 
05:20:12.298 --> 05:20:13.730 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question any further
questions

05:20:13.730 --> 05:20:13.740 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:20:16.850 --> 05:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you
 
05:20:18.708 --> 05:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
okay that was our last speaker so at
 
05:20:19.910 --> 05:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
this point I'm going to close the public
 
05:20:19.920 --> 05:20:21.050 align:start position:0%
this point I'm going to close the public
hearing

05:20:21.050 --> 05:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:20:26.390 --> 05:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
on HP 388 our next bill will be HB 393
 
05:22:29.030 --> 05:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:32.448 --> 05:22:32.458 align:start position:0%
okay being at uh 225 we will start the
 
05:22:35.288 --> 05:22:35.298 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB
 
05:22:38.208 --> 05:22:38.218 align:start position:0%
393 which is permitting a motor vehicle
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
operator to use only a rear license
 
05:22:41.520 --> 05:22:42.948 align:start position:0%
operator to use only a rear license
plates

05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
plates
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair like to
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
recognize our representative J.R Howell
 
05:22:52.390 --> 05:22:52.400 align:start position:0%

the bill before you
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
this could be my shortest testimony on
 
05:23:07.788 --> 05:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
the record I could say ditto closing and
 
05:23:10.610 --> 05:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
leave right there is it is very similar
 
05:23:13.010 --> 05:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
to representative Hinesville that we
 
05:23:15.590 --> 05:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
just discussed much of the testimony is
 
05:23:20.030 --> 05:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
parallel the difference in HB 393 versus
 
05:23:23.390 --> 05:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
three whatever the other one was 388 is
 
05:23:25.128 --> 05:23:25.138 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles would be allowed
 
05:23:27.890 --> 05:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
right in addition to
 
05:23:30.650 --> 05:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
um just private passenger vehicles I did
 
05:23:32.270 --> 05:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
email at the request of members of the
 
05:23:32.280 --> 05:23:33.530 align:start position:0%
email at the request of members of the
committee

05:23:33.530 --> 05:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:23:35.690 --> 05:23:35.700 align:start position:0%
um some text that you should have in
 
05:23:37.550 --> 05:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
your inboxes already regarding the 21
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
states that have a single license plate
 
05:23:40.798 --> 05:23:42.110 align:start position:0%
states that have a single license plate
only

05:23:42.110 --> 05:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
only
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and for the record
 
05:23:47.448 --> 05:23:47.458 align:start position:0%
um Ohio in 2020 just adopted a similar
 
05:23:47.458 --> 05:23:49.090 align:start position:0%
um Ohio in 2020 just adopted a similar
measure

05:23:49.090 --> 05:23:49.100 align:start position:0%
measure
 
05:23:52.010 --> 05:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
I am in full support of and I did not
 
05:23:54.590 --> 05:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of 388 I'm in full
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
support of that bill I believe there are
 
05:23:57.120 --> 05:23:57.948 align:start position:0%
support of that bill I believe there are
some

05:23:57.948 --> 05:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:23:59.750 --> 05:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
some similarities between the bills that
 
05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
could be worked out
 
05:24:04.850 --> 05:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
whether it's the Tesla owners whether
 
05:24:06.590 --> 05:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's the sports car owners there's a
 
05:24:10.010 --> 05:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
number of other car owners that for some
 
05:24:11.690 --> 05:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
reason don't want to damage their car
 
05:24:14.868 --> 05:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
the antique cars out there whatever
 
05:24:17.030 --> 05:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's past time to start thinking about a
 
05:24:18.830 --> 05:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
solution where the rear license plate is
 
05:24:21.170 --> 05:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
the only one and for for the record
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
everybody who gets a personalized vanity
 
05:24:26.930 --> 05:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
plate in the state
 
05:24:32.330 --> 05:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
guilty uh even my trailer guilty
 
05:24:34.490 --> 05:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
05:24:37.190 --> 05:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
um right a period of time somewhere
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
between a couple of days and six weeks
 
05:24:42.050 --> 05:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
or so where you're driving around only
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
with a rear license plate with some
 
05:24:47.330 --> 05:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
piece of plastic as my town clerk told
 
05:24:49.550 --> 05:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
me to do right wrap it in plastic it'll
 
05:24:51.948 --> 05:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
last longer that way it doesn't like get
 
05:24:53.690 --> 05:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
destroyed by the weather I'm like oh
 
05:24:56.150 --> 05:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea so
 
05:24:58.610 --> 05:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
we routinely do this we have to solve
 
05:25:00.230 --> 05:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
the problem for rear placement license
 
05:25:03.110 --> 05:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
plates only okay
 
05:25:06.288 --> 05:25:06.298 align:start position:0%
there is no reason in a state that just
 
05:25:10.128 --> 05:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
adopted in 2018 a privacy amendment to
 
05:25:12.890 --> 05:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
the Constitution that was overwhelmingly
 
05:25:16.788 --> 05:25:16.798 align:start position:0%
adopted by 81 percent okay to continue
 
05:25:18.890 --> 05:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
to allow the front license plate skin
 
05:25:20.570 --> 05:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
readers and some of the other things the
 
05:25:22.670 --> 05:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
prior testimony talked about
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
this is a privacy issue there is a
 
05:25:26.448 --> 05:25:26.458 align:start position:0%
reason that people would rather just
 
05:25:29.090 --> 05:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
have one license plate it does allow the
 
05:25:31.310 --> 05:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
police officers and the state police to
 
05:25:33.410 --> 05:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
identify the car if they have a reason
 
05:25:35.690 --> 05:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
to pull it over and to know who's in
 
05:25:37.368 --> 05:25:37.378 align:start position:0%
there who owns it whether it's still
 
05:25:41.208 --> 05:25:41.218 align:start position:0%
current registration is still current
 
05:25:43.010 --> 05:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
um all of that still happens with a rear
 
05:25:43.020 --> 05:25:44.868 align:start position:0%
um all of that still happens with a rear
identification

05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
identification
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
um the the tax revenue
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
um to Mr Saint or representative
 
05:25:50.448 --> 05:25:50.458 align:start position:0%
Sinclair's comment right we have to
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
solve this problem for the other 21
 
05:25:53.448 --> 05:25:53.458 align:start position:0%
states that might drive through New
 
05:25:55.190 --> 05:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anyway so we can't just
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
dismiss that we haven't bothered to put
 
05:25:59.570 --> 05:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
license plate readers at 36 different
 
05:26:01.788 --> 05:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
locations at the cost of four hundred
 
05:26:03.288 --> 05:26:03.298 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
05:26:05.570 --> 05:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
um that seemed High by the way being on
 
05:26:08.690 --> 05:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
finance 36 locations at ten thousand
 
05:26:09.948 --> 05:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
dollars a piece
 
05:26:12.410 --> 05:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
um we should sharpen our pencil the
 
05:26:14.930 --> 05:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
anyway I would ask that you would pass
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill and allow this state to
 
05:26:19.550 --> 05:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
continue to show that we are truly a
 
05:26:22.490 --> 05:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die State thank you
 
05:26:24.230 --> 05:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:31.730 --> 05:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
chair at this point I'd like to
 
05:26:34.730 --> 05:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Dan Hines who
 
05:26:40.070 --> 05:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:41.690 --> 05:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh Dan Hines
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
representing town of Bedford I just
 
05:26:45.050 --> 05:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on the Easy Pass issue a
 
05:26:46.430 --> 05:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
great representative Hall it would be
 
05:26:48.470 --> 05:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
nice to find a solution but in the
 
05:26:49.970 --> 05:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
alternative since I was proposing an
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to my bill and if that I would
 
05:26:53.570 --> 05:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
also support that amendment to this bill
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
that the people pay the same eight
 
05:26:56.510 --> 05:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
dollars whether they get one or two
 
05:26:58.610 --> 05:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
plates uh I wouldn't object if there
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
were an amendment saying that this would
 
05:27:02.510 --> 05:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
only apply to people have easy passes
 
05:27:04.368 --> 05:27:04.378 align:start position:0%
um because I don't know that vehicles
 
05:27:06.410 --> 05:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
have a problem with easy passes so if we
 
05:27:08.030 --> 05:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
want to further limit to that it would
 
05:27:10.610 --> 05:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to more Revenue to the
 
05:27:11.990 --> 05:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
state although I think the solution
 
05:27:13.850 --> 05:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
might be different but if the committee
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
were to adopt that or consider that I
 
05:27:18.948 --> 05:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
think that would be fine
 
05:27:21.948 --> 05:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
05:27:23.628 --> 05:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
 
05:27:23.638 --> 05:27:24.830 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much thank
you

05:27:24.830 --> 05:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:27:26.330 --> 05:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
at this point the chair like to
 
05:27:29.208 --> 05:27:29.218 align:start position:0%
recognize drawn Drury
 
05:27:32.448 --> 05:27:32.458 align:start position:0%
who just requesting four minutes and he
 
05:27:41.810 --> 05:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:44.208 --> 05:27:44.218 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:27:47.390 --> 05:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're good but good
 
05:27:48.530 --> 05:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
um if you want to take my previous
 
05:27:51.110 --> 05:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh in conjunction I don't want
 
05:27:53.330 --> 05:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
to bore you uh with that
 
05:27:54.830 --> 05:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
um if you would like to hear the states
 
05:27:56.570 --> 05:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
that currently that was what I was
 
05:27:58.128 --> 05:27:58.138 align:start position:0%
quickly Googling out there according to
 
05:27:59.570 --> 05:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire rather the Insurance
 
05:28:01.190 --> 05:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
Institute I'm more than happy to read
 
05:28:02.930 --> 05:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
those into the record for you the
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
closest state is Pennsylvania to us
 
05:28:08.570 --> 05:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
um that uh is a single plate State and
 
05:28:10.910 --> 05:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
and as I believe the trooper said they
 
05:28:12.288 --> 05:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
were having problems with their tolling
 
05:28:13.910 --> 05:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
system as well
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
um but my testimony would remain the
 
05:28:16.320 --> 05:28:17.330 align:start position:0%
um but my testimony would remain the
same

05:28:17.330 --> 05:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
same
 
05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and as I say uh I'm proud to live in
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
a two-plate state
 
05:28:24.590 --> 05:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and I just find that the the
 
05:28:26.930 --> 05:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
advantages are just so overwhelming for
 
05:28:29.208 --> 05:28:29.218 align:start position:0%
uh for law enforcement
 
05:28:32.390 --> 05:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
um to keep us in that uh Avenue
 
05:28:35.390 --> 05:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and uh I would just respectfully ask
 
05:28:37.610 --> 05:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
that you find these bills in expedient
 
05:28:38.930 --> 05:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
05:28:41.448 --> 05:28:41.458 align:start position:0%
um on behalf of the New Hampshire Chiefs
 
05:28:43.010 --> 05:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
and Police Association and I greatly
 
05:28:44.810 --> 05:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time once again
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
any I'd be more than happy to take any
 
05:28:48.288 --> 05:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
questions could you send those the list
 
05:28:50.030 --> 05:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
of 20 states to the committee here and
 
05:28:51.350 --> 05:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
we'll pass it around I can make sure
 
05:28:53.390 --> 05:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
that happens to you appreciate that any
 
05:28:54.890 --> 05:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:28:59.090 --> 05:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair i i before I ask
 
05:29:02.090 --> 05:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
it is the gentleman from the turnpike is
 
05:29:06.110 --> 05:29:06.120 align:start position:0%

I have yes okay I'll I'll wait for him
 
05:29:11.570 --> 05:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
then thank you representative Fox
 
05:29:13.070 --> 05:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:29:14.868 --> 05:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
um you indicated that Pennsylvania was
 
05:29:17.090 --> 05:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
the nearest State to us and that they
 
05:29:20.208 --> 05:29:20.218 align:start position:0%
were experiencing some some issues do
 
05:29:22.190 --> 05:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
you know what those issues were
 
05:29:23.810 --> 05:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for your question
 
05:29:26.090 --> 05:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's just as I had heard as you did I
 
05:29:27.410 --> 05:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
thought the trooper mentioned they were
 
05:29:29.810 --> 05:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
having some tolling problems as well
 
05:29:31.850 --> 05:29:31.860 align:start position:0%
um with it and uh but if he's going to
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
testify I would I would uh relay that
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:40.430 --> 05:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you thank you very
 
05:29:46.730 --> 05:29:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
the chair like to recognize uh Mikey
 
05:29:49.200 --> 05:29:50.690 align:start position:0%
the chair like to recognize uh Mikey
Levitz

05:29:50.690 --> 05:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
Levitz
 
05:29:53.868 --> 05:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
maybe like five minutes and he supports
 
05:29:59.050 --> 05:29:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:02.208 --> 05:30:02.218 align:start position:0%
my name is Mikey Levis I'm in favor of
 
05:30:05.030 --> 05:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
both the uh was it 388 and 393 but I
 
05:30:06.350 --> 05:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
chose to only speak on this one because
 
05:30:09.230 --> 05:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's a little I guess broader this this
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
bill isn't really an issue for me I
 
05:30:12.230 --> 05:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't entirely mind putting a front
 
05:30:13.910 --> 05:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
plate on I don't drive sports cars or
 
05:30:15.230 --> 05:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
anything like that so it's not a big
 
05:30:16.788 --> 05:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
deal but I do like the idea of having
 
05:30:19.610 --> 05:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
that option as other people have said
 
05:30:22.128 --> 05:30:22.138 align:start position:0%
there are 20 20 or so states that don't
 
05:30:24.350 --> 05:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
require a front plate Ohio being the
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
most recent one to make that change this
 
05:30:29.448 --> 05:30:29.458 align:start position:0%
whole debate has been hashed out
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
numerous times and
 
05:30:34.850 --> 05:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
we find that it isn't really an issue
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
Ohio Pennsylvania Michigan and all these
 
05:30:39.170 --> 05:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
other states they are able to solve the
 
05:30:39.180 --> 05:30:40.190 align:start position:0%
other states they are able to solve the
crimes

05:30:40.190 --> 05:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
05:30:42.948 --> 05:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
and as much as it may help solving
 
05:30:45.288 --> 05:30:45.298 align:start position:0%
crimes it also
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
when police are enforcing this law it
 
05:30:50.510 --> 05:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
does distract them from other issues if
 
05:30:51.708 --> 05:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
they're looking for front plates they're
 
05:30:53.090 --> 05:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
not looking for
 
05:30:54.890 --> 05:30:54.900 align:start position:0%
other driving issues or they're not
 
05:30:56.810 --> 05:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
working on actual violent crimes which
 
05:30:58.368 --> 05:30:58.378 align:start position:0%
is an issue
 
05:31:02.030 --> 05:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
so for some reason there is a special
 
05:31:03.830 --> 05:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
exception to our fundamental rights when
 
05:31:05.270 --> 05:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
it comes to Vehicles no one would ever
 
05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
say that you have to wear a plate on
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
your shirt or on the back of your shirt
 
05:31:10.910 --> 05:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
to identify you we do have that issue
 
05:31:12.948 --> 05:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
coming in with facial recognition but
 
05:31:14.690 --> 05:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
that would be insane most people would
 
05:31:16.128 --> 05:31:16.138 align:start position:0%
find that insane
 
05:31:19.368 --> 05:31:19.378 align:start position:0%
if we need front plates to identify a
 
05:31:21.410 --> 05:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
car why not plates on the sides too why
 
05:31:23.570 --> 05:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
not a plate on the roof
 
05:31:25.070 --> 05:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
if there's an issue of identifying
 
05:31:26.330 --> 05:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
Vehicles you have to think about all
 
05:31:29.690 --> 05:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:31.610 --> 05:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
and then the the
 
05:31:34.550 --> 05:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the the Department of
 
05:31:35.810 --> 05:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
Transportation said there are issues
 
05:31:37.970 --> 05:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
with toll Revenue
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
trailers only have rear plates so
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have a front plate so if
 
05:31:45.470 --> 05:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
you're collecting if you're if they're
 
05:31:47.448 --> 05:31:47.458 align:start position:0%
scanning the rear plate and they can't
 
05:31:49.368 --> 05:31:49.378 align:start position:0%
get that there's no front plate on the
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
trailer either
 
05:31:52.910 --> 05:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
you also have to look at the other side
 
05:31:55.610 --> 05:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
of it he says they may lose Revenue
 
05:31:57.288 --> 05:31:57.298 align:start position:0%
things don't always work out perfectly I
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
have to say honestly tough cookies
 
05:32:01.430 --> 05:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
I once went through a toll in New York
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
and they sent me the camera camera like
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
notice in the mail that said this is
 
05:32:10.128 --> 05:32:10.138 align:start position:0%
your plate and this is what you owe I
 
05:32:12.288 --> 05:32:12.298 align:start position:0%
was driving a
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
sedan and it said it had three axles the
 
05:32:16.970 --> 05:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
car does not have three axles it had two
 
05:32:20.810 --> 05:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
axles so I sent in the dispute form
 
05:32:23.690 --> 05:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
and they acknowledged the dispute
 
05:32:25.730 --> 05:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
and then sent me another notice that I
 
05:32:27.410 --> 05:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
still owe it
 
05:32:29.090 --> 05:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
so I sent I went through that whole
 
05:32:30.410 --> 05:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
thing so you have to look at both sides
 
05:32:32.690 --> 05:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
of the thing yes the the
 
05:32:34.670 --> 05:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
the the Department of Transportation
 
05:32:36.050 --> 05:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
might miss out on some revenues but
 
05:32:38.030 --> 05:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
they're also people who are
 
05:32:41.090 --> 05:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
getting fined or told unnecessarily and
 
05:32:42.410 --> 05:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
then they don't always they're not like
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
me and they are not going to fight it
 
05:32:46.250 --> 05:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
so we have to look at both sides of this
 
05:32:48.530 --> 05:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
so just because the state might lose a
 
05:32:49.850 --> 05:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
little bit of Revenue
 
05:32:51.890 --> 05:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
you have to
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
think about how that's not
 
05:32:56.868 --> 05:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
always important
 
05:32:58.550 --> 05:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
I do recognize there are issues with
 
05:33:00.170 --> 05:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
this I'm not
 
05:33:01.970 --> 05:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
super gung-ho about this bill as other
 
05:33:03.650 --> 05:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
bills but I do think it's a good bill
 
05:33:05.208 --> 05:33:05.218 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to see either one pass if
 
05:33:06.530 --> 05:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's the other one that's great if it's
 
05:33:08.690 --> 05:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
this one that's even better so I think
 
05:33:10.490 --> 05:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's a good step forward again there's
 
05:33:13.670 --> 05:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
20 states that have this I don't think
 
05:33:15.050 --> 05:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
they have higher crime rates than we do
 
05:33:16.670 --> 05:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think their law enforcement has
 
05:33:18.110 --> 05:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
as many issues maybe they have a few
 
05:33:19.490 --> 05:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
issues but I think they managed to get
 
05:33:21.890 --> 05:33:21.900 align:start position:0%
it done and I think I you know I believe
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
in our law enforcement's ability to
 
05:33:28.128 --> 05:33:28.138 align:start position:0%
solve crimes so I think this is a kind
 
05:33:30.830 --> 05:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
of a ridiculous issue to
 
05:33:34.430 --> 05:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
make that distinction thank you
 
05:33:35.690 --> 05:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
05:33:35.700 --> 05:33:37.610 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
committee

05:33:37.610 --> 05:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:33:41.090 --> 05:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:43.430 --> 05:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
chair like to recognize John Cochran
 
05:33:46.190 --> 05:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire D.O.T who would
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
like uh five minutes and he opposes the
 
05:33:49.920 --> 05:33:54.610 align:start position:0%
like uh five minutes and he opposes the
bill

05:33:54.610 --> 05:33:54.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:58.190 --> 05:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and committee
 
05:34:00.530 --> 05:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
um will you accept my testimony from a
 
05:34:02.930 --> 05:34:02.940 align:start position:0%
previous bill it's pretty much the same
 
05:34:02.940 --> 05:34:04.430 align:start position:0%
previous bill it's pretty much the same
except

05:34:04.430 --> 05:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
except
 
05:34:06.170 --> 05:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
um there is one thing in regards to
 
05:34:08.270 --> 05:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
commercial vehicles
 
05:34:11.750 --> 05:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we definitely do not uh we oppose
 
05:34:13.368 --> 05:34:13.378 align:start position:0%
this bill because on commercial vehicles
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of times they're pulling trailers
 
05:34:18.530 --> 05:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
and we're only allowed to invoice the
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
first owner of the vehicle we cannot
 
05:34:23.330 --> 05:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
invoice the trailer so we need the front
 
05:34:26.090 --> 05:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
license plate to invoice any of the
 
05:34:28.128 --> 05:34:28.138 align:start position:0%
tractor trailers or people who are
 
05:34:30.530 --> 05:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
pulling trailers so we
 
05:34:32.090 --> 05:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill because of the
 
05:34:35.150 --> 05:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
commercial side of this
 
05:34:37.850 --> 05:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Sinclair
 
05:34:42.110 --> 05:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:34:42.120 --> 05:34:42.770 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:34:42.770 --> 05:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:46.550 --> 05:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
so a a car not a commercial vehicle but
 
05:34:48.650 --> 05:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
from Ohio could be pulling a trailer too
 
05:34:52.550 --> 05:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:52.560 --> 05:34:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

05:34:54.350 --> 05:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:34:58.070 --> 05:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
you were talking about the loss of tolls
 
05:35:00.410 --> 05:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
um because of the single license plate
 
05:35:02.930 --> 05:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
and and I'm not encouraging a change to
 
05:35:04.970 --> 05:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
this but I all I could think about was
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of thousands of motorcycles
 
05:35:10.610 --> 05:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
to go through those tall riding season
 
05:35:13.910 --> 05:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
with just one plate in the rear and is
 
05:35:16.910 --> 05:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
the state experiencing a loss of
 
05:35:18.708 --> 05:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars because
 
05:35:22.010 --> 05:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much the loss is with
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
more Cycles but more Cycles are tough to
 
05:35:28.610 --> 05:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
pick up you know their license plates
 
05:35:31.490 --> 05:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
and stuff and also they have
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
transponders and they waive them and
 
05:35:34.970 --> 05:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
it's hard to pick up their transponders
 
05:35:37.850 --> 05:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
too so there is issues with the
 
05:35:40.550 --> 05:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
motorcycles yeah
 
05:35:42.830 --> 05:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you back to the attendance thank
 
05:35:42.840 --> 05:35:43.628 align:start position:0%
thank you back to the attendance thank
you

05:35:43.628 --> 05:35:43.638 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:35:46.190 --> 05:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative sellers
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
so a car or a vehicle towing a
 
05:35:53.448 --> 05:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
Recreation vehicle
 
05:35:56.990 --> 05:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh you mean the uh
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
um we would no we take a picture of the
 
05:36:05.690 --> 05:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
license plate of the camper but we
 
05:36:09.050 --> 05:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
cannot use that license plate to invoice
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we can only invoice the owner of the
 
05:36:14.390 --> 05:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle the truck not the trailer
 
05:36:16.730 --> 05:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
or the or the the car was pulling the
 
05:36:16.740 --> 05:36:20.470 align:start position:0%
or the or the the car was pulling the
trailer

05:36:20.470 --> 05:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:23.030 --> 05:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
so you do collect a fee for the trailer
 
05:36:24.770 --> 05:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
though that's what I'm getting oh yes if
 
05:36:26.208 --> 05:36:26.218 align:start position:0%
they're the toll yeah they get charged
 
05:36:29.570 --> 05:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:32.090 --> 05:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
follow up I I have one other question
 
05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:36:35.690 --> 05:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know how many vehicles go through
 
05:36:35.700 --> 05:36:37.010 align:start position:0%
you know how many vehicles go through
the

05:36:37.010 --> 05:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:36:40.430 --> 05:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
the tolls so you know how much you
 
05:36:42.470 --> 05:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
collect so you know how much you don't
 
05:36:42.480 --> 05:36:44.810 align:start position:0%
collect so you know how much you don't
collect

05:36:44.810 --> 05:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
collect
 
05:36:48.050 --> 05:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:51.288 --> 05:36:51.298 align:start position:0%
yes I mean do you mean there is a lot of
 
05:36:51.298 --> 05:36:52.610 align:start position:0%
yes I mean do you mean there is a lot of
like

05:36:52.610 --> 05:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:36:54.590 --> 05:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
when you're into electronic tolling
 
05:36:57.410 --> 05:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
there is a percentage of loss because
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
you have bad images you know different
 
05:37:03.650 --> 05:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
stuff like that and you right now are
 
05:37:06.110 --> 05:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
they call it leakage or a loss it's
 
05:37:09.230 --> 05:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
around two to three percent you know
 
05:37:12.288 --> 05:37:12.298 align:start position:0%
with AET it can get higher just because
 
05:37:14.030 --> 05:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's a everybody's going through
 
05:37:19.610 --> 05:37:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
05:37:25.070 --> 05:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you
 
05:37:27.170 --> 05:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:37:29.570 --> 05:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
okay she and I like to recognize uh
 
05:37:32.868 --> 05:37:32.878 align:start position:0%
staff sergeant Tom conlon who's asking
 
05:37:34.610 --> 05:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
for three minutes
 
05:37:43.750 --> 05:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:45.590 --> 05:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
committee for having me today yeah my
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
name's uh Tom Collins I work for the
 
05:37:50.810 --> 05:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
state police I work out of Troop G
 
05:37:52.670 --> 05:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
Barracks I'm the assistant troop
 
05:37:53.690 --> 05:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
Commander there
 
05:37:55.910 --> 05:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we've heard testimony today both
 
05:37:58.368 --> 05:37:58.378 align:start position:0%
these two uh very similar bills you
 
05:37:59.628 --> 05:37:59.638 align:start position:0%
heard from a former crash
 
05:38:01.010 --> 05:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
Reconstructionist you heard from a
 
05:38:02.810 --> 05:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
homicide investigator so I'm going to be
 
05:38:05.030 --> 05:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
very brief I'll speak from a patrol
 
05:38:07.250 --> 05:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
perspective because I work Patrol from
 
05:38:09.050 --> 05:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of my career down in
 
05:38:11.810 --> 05:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
troop a on 95 and route 101.
 
05:38:15.230 --> 05:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
so work control you get a vast majority
 
05:38:18.288 --> 05:38:18.298 align:start position:0%
of we'll call them citizen complaints or
 
05:38:20.270 --> 05:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
on hazards operators you know suspected
 
05:38:23.390 --> 05:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
dby Vehicles involved in Hit and Run and
 
05:38:25.730 --> 05:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
from my experience the license plate is
 
05:38:28.190 --> 05:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
the best identifying information
 
05:38:30.650 --> 05:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
you can on your way home today look on
 
05:38:32.750 --> 05:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
the highways you can find every single
 
05:38:35.030 --> 05:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
make model in color duplicated many
 
05:38:38.810 --> 05:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
times so the license plate is essential
 
05:38:41.030 --> 05:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
to identifying the correct vehicle and
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
obviously deleting one of those plates
 
05:38:45.590 --> 05:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be kind of that Effectiveness in
 
05:38:45.600 --> 05:38:46.368 align:start position:0%
would be kind of that Effectiveness in
half

05:38:46.368 --> 05:38:46.378 align:start position:0%
half
 
05:38:48.050 --> 05:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
as far as the commercial motor vehicle
 
05:38:50.510 --> 05:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
aspect obviously not all commercial
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles but a vast majority pull
 
05:38:54.110 --> 05:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
the trailer in some sort of
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
configuration and furtherness of the
 
05:38:58.368 --> 05:38:58.378 align:start position:0%
business so this would uh severely
 
05:39:00.530 --> 05:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
inhibit that ability to properly
 
05:39:02.448 --> 05:39:02.458 align:start position:0%
identify those trucks
 
05:39:04.310 --> 05:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:06.230 --> 05:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions from
 
05:39:07.310 --> 05:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:39:09.470 --> 05:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you thanks
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
chair the
 
05:39:13.190 --> 05:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
dude and
 
05:39:15.530 --> 05:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know how many crimes I saw
 
05:39:17.510 --> 05:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
because of the front plate do you have
 
05:39:19.910 --> 05:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
those statistics thank you for your
 
05:39:22.910 --> 05:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
question I do not I'm not sure if that
 
05:39:25.670 --> 05:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
would is really quantifiable except
 
05:39:29.410 --> 05:39:29.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:32.810 --> 05:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair thank you
 
05:39:36.530 --> 05:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
I get the the thing about the two plates
 
05:39:39.708 --> 05:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
I really do but what mystifies me is why
 
05:39:42.110 --> 05:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's and I asked the other Trooper
 
05:39:44.990 --> 05:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's the lieutenant why there's not
 
05:39:48.410 --> 05:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
or is there a national push between law
 
05:39:50.750 --> 05:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies to require every
 
05:39:53.868 --> 05:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
state to have two license plates on
 
05:39:56.208 --> 05:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles
 
05:39:58.368 --> 05:39:58.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for your questioning I
 
05:40:00.170 --> 05:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
apologize I I do not know of any
 
05:40:04.128 --> 05:40:04.138 align:start position:0%
committee or or a national push for that
 
05:40:04.138 --> 05:40:05.930 align:start position:0%
committee or or a national push for that
could

05:40:05.930 --> 05:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:40:09.110 --> 05:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:10.730 --> 05:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
