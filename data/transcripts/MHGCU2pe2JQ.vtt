um
 
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to open up uh this committee
 
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
conference with the discussion of
 
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.270 align:start position:0%
conference with the discussion of
how

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
the bill was amended by the Senate it
 
00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 align:start position:0%
was originally
 
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
a bill which
 
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.350 align:start position:0%
a bill which
um

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 align:start position:0%
ex which took out language from RSA 143
 
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 align:start position:0%
hyphen a colon 5 Section 7 which took
 
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
out the
 
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
maximum annual gross sales of 35
 
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.650 align:start position:0%
maximum annual gross sales of 35
000

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 align:start position:0%
from the homestead food operations
 
00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 align:start position:0%
RSA and the Senate then added language
 
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 align:start position:0%
having to do with the slaughter
 
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
when it came to the house
 
00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
we looked at that and had some issues
 
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 align:start position:0%
with the language that was added so
 
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
hence we had a non-concur and requested
 
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.750 align:start position:0%
committee conference
um

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby
 
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 align:start position:0%
had worked with
 
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
one of the Senators Senator Innis
 
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
to develop some language that was more
 
00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the house position and
 
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby if you would please
 
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
explain your amendment that you're
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
bringing today okay so um actually I'd
 
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
like to see if
 
00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
um our Senate colleagues could just give
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
somebody some sense of where why they
 
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
decided to put this uh their Amendment
 
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.509 align:start position:0%
decided to put this uh their Amendment
on

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
um at this point rather than having it
 
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
go go through the regular regular Bill
 
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.110 align:start position:0%
go go through the regular regular Bill
process

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
well good morning and uh thanks for
 
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
having us it's good to be back in my old
 
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.449 align:start position:0%
having us it's good to be back in my old
committee

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
good to have you uh always good to be
 
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
back so uh this language was brought
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
into us and in reviewing it this has
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
been something that we've all been
 
00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
looking at for many years doing these
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
types of things and it seemed like it
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
was a the language worked and it was a
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
good fit and we had agreement from all
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the stakeholders that they were in
 
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
general okay with this I know there were
 
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
a few concerns from Health and Human
 
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
Services but they were things that we
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
were able to address
 
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
and so we decided it was a good time to
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
put this on and bring it forward
 
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
so that is that is why it's in the bill
 
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
um when it came over to us uh we
 
00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:01.850 align:start position:0%
um when it came over to us uh we
um

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
we checked in with the state vet and he
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
said that he had some concerns about the
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
lack of testing for CWD brucellosis
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis and a couple of others that
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
I don't remember which they are right
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
now but
 
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.170 align:start position:0%
now but
um

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:22.259 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
um so that he was hesitant to uh to say
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
yeah this is great
 
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
um at the same time we recognized that
 
00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.189 align:start position:0%
um at the same time we recognized that
the

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
um elk and deer Farmers have been
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
looking for some way to do Humane
 
00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 align:start position:0%
Slaughter on the farm as opposed to
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
making and taking the essentially wild
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
animals to a slaughterhouse which is
 
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
highly stressful it's not good for the
 
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
animals it's not good for the meat so
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
um so we thought that um there should be
 
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
some way to make this work in the short
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
run uh but in the long run we want to
 
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
make sure that the state vets concerns
 
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
about uh disease surveillance are
 
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
sufficiently met
 
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh Judy and I got on uh had a a good uh
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
discussion with uh Senator Innis uh and
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh who I believe
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
um brought the language originally
 
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
um and we came up with uh this amendment
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
and the basic idea uh there are three
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
key parts to this amendment one is to
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh the uh that the the
 
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
bill itself includes language that
 
00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 align:start position:0%
indicates that uh the red the
 
00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:53.629 align:start position:0%
indicates that uh the red the
um

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
Red Deer and Elk are properly enclosed
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
are propagated uh only from within
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
existing herds and
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh that are they're not brought in from
 
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh there are none brought in from out of
 
00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
state uh and that and also that if there
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
are atypical deaths that those animals
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
on on any of those Farms if those
 
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
animals get tested for CWD so that if
 
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 align:start position:0%
there if there is CWD coming into the
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
state somehow uh which it could through
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
wild herds uh that we get an early early
 
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
warning sign of that
 
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so that it doesn't get into the food
 
00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759 align:start position:0%
supply uh the other thing is that we
 
00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:42.419 align:start position:0%
want to come back and do a proper study
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
of how this should be done in the long
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
term so we set a two-year Sunset
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
um the sunset would would happen July
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
1st 2025.
 
00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:56.890 align:start position:0%
1st 2025.
um

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:56.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and that should give us plenty of
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
time to get a
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
um to get the uh
 
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
a a pro a more a more thoroughly
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
structured program up and running there
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
are programs Maine has a good set of
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
regulations on they have a two-tier
 
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
system for their um Red Deer and Elk
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
Farms that they have a monitoring level
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
and they have a level that's compliant
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
with the USDA certification program
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh so we could look at how they have
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
their structured and possibly use that
 
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
as a model
 
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
um and representative Bixby we do have
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
plans for a study committee
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
that a bill that had been passed yes
 
00:08:49.009 --> 00:08:49.019 align:start position:0%
that establishes a study committee to
 
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
look at this issue yes so that that's I
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
believe that that the governor just
 
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
signed the uh the guy I know that the
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
governor just signed the budget
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I was told that that
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
language was put into the budget uh so
 
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.269 align:start position:0%
language was put into the budget uh so
um

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
so that so um so ostensively when that
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
study committee uh is done we will have
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
something that will replace the at this
 
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
after the two-year Sunset yes or
 
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
actually we'll probably replace it
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
before the two years let's see if we'll
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
even reach the sunset right
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative I do have one question
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
sure am I trying to make sure I'm
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
reading this right but on the last page
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
page four line three this is section 7
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
through 10 of this actual take effect
 
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
July 1st 2025. right okay so make sure
 
00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding this okay so it took
 
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
me a little bit to figure out what
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
Courtney had done yeah
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
I just noticed that so so let me just go
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
through from from start to finish so I
 
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
can and and I can be pretty quick on the
 
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
explanations uh on the first page uh so
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
um the new section J is basically
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
referencing the
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
um statutes that uh in the fish and game
 
00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:10.459 align:start position:0%
laws and in the Aguas that uh relate to
 
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh propagation uh and and key and
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
keeping of Red Deer and Elk uh and
 
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.100 align:start position:0%
um and also and the and for under 420
 
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
436-24 uh there is a
 
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.509 align:start position:0%
436-24 uh there is a
um

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
there is a rule that says that uh in
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
order to uh import deer from servants
 
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:37.019 align:start position:0%
from out of state both the sending and
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
receiving State need to be compliant
 
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
with the uh Federal
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
um program for certification and New
 
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire is not so
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
basically that that basically bans the
 
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:51.140 align:start position:0%
import of out-of-state deer until
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
unless we at some point are part of that
 
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.329 align:start position:0%
unless we at some point are part of that
program

00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:10:56.339 --> 00:10:57.050 align:start position:0%
program
um

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
and then uh for
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay the um
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
that sets up that is sets up the testing
 
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
in case of an atypical death uh and then
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
um sections new section six adds the
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
definition for an atypical death and
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
then we get to section seven on line 16
 
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
and uh this is this has to do with the
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
Sun the sunset starts here
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
so uh in order to make the sunset what
 
00:11:38.569 --> 00:11:38.579 align:start position:0%
uh OLS did was they created a
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
perspective amendment that would
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
basically put back into place the law as
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
it had been before this uh this
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
amendment this amendment takes place
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
um so section seven and section eight uh
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
um putting removing elk and red deer
 
00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:02.839 align:start position:0%
from the food Protection Services
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
statutes and section 9 reinstates uh RSA
 
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:16.820 align:start position:0%
420 427 colon 2A uh as it was before
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
well as it is right now and as as it you
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
know prior to this bill taking effect uh
 
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:27.260 align:start position:0%
that's it will replace that so
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a bad part of me for one
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
second but you know we've done these a
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
lot with sunsets and and can't we just
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
say it's repealed
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot simpler to just say that
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
this uh this entire change is repealed
 
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
not overwrite
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
the change with a new bill that goes
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
back to the old bill that just seems
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
convoluted to me so this is the way that
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
OLS chose to do it I did not suggest
 
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
this is the way to do it but they deemed
 
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
that this was the way to do it and they
 
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.210 align:start position:0%
that this was the way to do it and they
are

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:01.220 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh more uh my experience is that they
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
are generally more knowledgeable about
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
the way that statutes need to be
 
00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:10.629 align:start position:0%
the way that statutes need to be
um

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh changed then uh that I am and it not
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
only went through
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
um the drafting attorney uh Courtney
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
ashbach but also was reviewed by their
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
in their review process and they deemed
 
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
that this is this was this was the right
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
way to do it I'm going to trust them on
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
it and it it looks like it will do the
 
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.310 align:start position:0%
it and it it looks like it will do the
job

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to I don't want to make
 
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
any fuss about you know how they chose
 
00:13:41.949 --> 00:13:41.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:47.339 align:start position:0%
um so a couple of things I
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
I I understand the intent of where we're
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
going and I would I would like to see us
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
get to a place where
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
I do have a few
 
00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.810 align:start position:0%
I do have a few
um

00:13:59.810 --> 00:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
hesitations I would say just in general
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
about the we want to make sure that New
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire stays free of CWD and as I
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
understand it right now we don't have
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
um but it exists elsewhere in our
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
bordering communities so I just want to
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are not opening the
 
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
door for
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
that and it is not necessarily something
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
you can tell exists by looking at an
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
animal just a quick correction we do not
 
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
have any neighboring states with CWD
 
00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:31.009 align:start position:0%
have any neighboring states with CWD
either

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
um the closest state that is actively
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring because of uh
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
outbreak years ago is New York
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
nothing bordering us is uh has got CD WD
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
or has had any cases thanks for the
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
correction representative but and I also
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
think there are a few
 
00:14:51.889 --> 00:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
um cases being monitored in Canada as
 
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
well so I just want to make sure that we
 
00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.970 align:start position:0%
well so I just want to make sure that we
are

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
it is a neurodegenerative disease that
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
is transferable to humans so I just want
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're proceeding with
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
something that well on our on Farm
 
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:07.100 align:start position:0%
Slaughter isn't going to promote that
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
that would happen by moving either
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
naturally or bringing in animals and I
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
think we've taken care of that
 
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm fine with that I just wanted to
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood what we were
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
putting in this amendment because it
 
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
does seem like a backwards way of doing
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
it but I guess I get it
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
it I when I first look at it I I said Oh
 
00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.569 align:start position:0%
it I when I first look at it I I said Oh
shoot

00:15:28.569 --> 00:15:28.579 align:start position:0%
shoot
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
what did Courtney do well and then and
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
then I and then I read it more carefully
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
and I raised oh okay that's how she did
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
it and I guess that's how she would have
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
had to do it I I can understand why she
 
00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
did it that way it's
 
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
so um my fellow Senate colleagues
 
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
understanding what we're what we're
 
00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459 align:start position:0%
doing here yeah okay
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
um and I think that uh it can one reason
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
why it can't simply be well just repeal
 
00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:02.339 align:start position:0%
the thing is that it didn't come through
 
00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.339 align:start position:0%
as an individual bill it's it it it came
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
through as an amendment to a uh to
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
another bill good point
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
okay and we wouldn't want we wouldn't
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
and so if the whole bill bill got
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
refueled then we'd lose the the the
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the cap on the homestead
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
Foods uh so can we have 10 seconds here

such Wagers when it came to the house we
 
00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:03.380 align:start position:0%
decided to non-concur
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
based on some of the additions that the
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
senate had made
 
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:10.860 align:start position:0%
and so we are here today to iron that
 
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.690 align:start position:0%
and so we are here today to iron that
out

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:33:15.769 --> 00:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.779 --> 00:33:16.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
one of the things that one of the
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
sticking points was particularly the
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
advanced deposit wagering language which
 
00:33:28.669 --> 00:33:28.679 align:start position:0%
was retained SB 190 was retained in the
 
00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee in the house
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if representative
 
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
Sanborn if you'd like to speak to that
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
for a moment
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes I'm here
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
representing the unanimous bipartisan
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
position of the ways and means house
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee to retain Senate Bill 190. uh
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
we have no problem with the other two
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
bills that are attached to House Bill
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
221 but we would like to continue to
 
00:33:57.289 --> 00:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
work on Senate Bill 190 in-house Ways
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
and Means and we plan to do so this fall
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
so we'd very much like to see this
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
unattached to this Christmas tree and
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
allowed to be worked on on its own okay
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
I have brought an amendment to that to
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
2023-2188h which strips out that
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
language from SB 190 from the bill that
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
came to us from the Senate and would
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
like Senate to make comment on that
 
00:34:31.329 --> 00:34:31.339 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
adopting this amendment which removes
 
00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
let me ask my colleagues what are your
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
thoughts yeah that's the house version
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're good with that who set up a 14 to
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
so I you know we're obviously here to
 
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
represent the Senate position and we had
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
added the two amendments the game camera
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
language and the advanced deposit
 
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.650 align:start position:0%
language and the advanced deposit
wagering

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
wagering
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
the uh you know certainly the the Senate
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
position as we'd like to keep that in
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
there but we understand that it's a a
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
point of contention with the house and
 
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
um we certainly if our value the
 
00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill and has spent the the
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
original 221 and we certainly value the
 
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
game camera language that was the
 
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.930 align:start position:0%
game camera language that was the
addition

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
addition
 
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.190 align:start position:0%
addition
um

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
everyone where my colleagues are I mean
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
I guess we can consider if
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
do we need to caucus or are you all you
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
know I'm good you're all okay with that
 
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
we're all good well we will accept the
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
amendment the uh I just would say that
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
our preference would have been to have
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
had this language move through well we
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
certainly respect Ways and Means and
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
you're retaining of of that language we
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
would we would like to have had it go
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
through and it was very important to um
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General into the Lottery
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
Commission but I guess that's gonna rest
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
on your shoulders now to make sure you
 
00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
get something through this fall and
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
satisfied the need that they expressed
 
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
to us that was so important which is why
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
we added it to this bill
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh we didn't hear that it was
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
urgent actually in our committee and I
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
checked with all of our members on that
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
um but we we do think it's important and
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
we'll absolutely be working on it this
 
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
fall thank you we appreciate that
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
commitment representative Bixby yeah I'd
 
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:27.180 align:start position:0%
just like to note that um the Senate uh
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
made a a small change to the underlying
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
bill on 221 which was to add one member
 
00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:35.660 align:start position:0%
to the oversight committee or commission
 
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
and uh that is something that we are
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
entirely fine with
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
um and uh we are fine with having the
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
game camera bill on this because we
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
think the game camera is very important
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh so I think that um what we should do
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
is a seed to the Senate position with
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment as presented by a
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
so we'll uh representative spleen yeah I
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh add that I did review the
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
language that the Senate added and also
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
with the language in this amendment they
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
all match with our house position of
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
what we passed with uh the uh compromise
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
language that we were able to come up
 
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
with for the game camera bill in sb14 so
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm good with it and I have no problem
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
at all uh moving forward with that thank
 
00:37:19.079 --> 00:37:23.410 align:start position:0%
at all uh moving forward with that thank
you

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:23.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
well if I could give one just
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so you don't need to make it a
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
vote you don't think
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
well I would like one quick response for
 
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh to uh representative Bixby I did add
 
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
a a another position to the board
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
because I don't like even boards I think
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
it was eight yeah yeah because I didn't
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
want the ability to be a tie and I
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
thought an additional farmer member on
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
the board would bring some great
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.329 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:37:56.329 --> 00:37:56.339 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
for for our house members here I move we
 
00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:04.700 align:start position:0%

01:35:18.659 --> 01:35:21.290 align:start position:0%
 
ish

01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate being unable to
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
agree on the versions of the bill uh we
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
are now going to have some discussion
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
over how we can come to an agreement
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
between the two bodies and push
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
something forward so that we can
 
01:35:44.810 --> 01:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
actually take action
 
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
um relatively soon especially given that
 
01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:48.659 align:start position:0%
one of the findings that was in the
 
01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
Senate version is that uh
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that needs to be addressed
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
very quickly
 
01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:57.830 align:start position:0%
very quickly
um

01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
I am going to
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
lay out
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that I found with the
 
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
Senate version which allowed us to non-
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
concur that being that I like what the
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
Senate did uh
 
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
we understand the diving for Lobster's
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
part is out that's not an issue we'll
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
address that another day but as far as
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
the cleanup goes uh allocating the
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
funding is good I think there needs to
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
be more guard rails around how that
 
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
funding is used to make sure it's used
 
01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:27.910 align:start position:0%
funding is used to make sure it's used
appropriately

01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we would not want
 
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
to see is just the money spent to send
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
some lobsterman out in their boats
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
dragging the hooks to try to come up and
 
01:36:42.770 --> 01:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
tell us that they didn't find anything
 
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure there's a good
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
faith effort to uh to actually retrieve
 
01:36:49.490 --> 01:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
the traps that we know are out there and
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
that the money is being spent to the
 
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
ends of removing this junk from the
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
waters I'm going to now
 
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
plus the other thing was that it doesn't
 
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
start till 2024 with any kind of cleanup
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't even say in the beginning of
 
01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:06.179 align:start position:0%
2024 in the bill it just says three
 
01:37:09.649 --> 01:37:09.659 align:start position:0%
times in 2024 and three times in 2025.
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
and and if one of the findings is that
 
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
there's an immediate need to address the
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
issue waiting till sometime in 2024
 
01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
which could be a year from now is not
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
really addressing the issue according to
 
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
the finding so I'm going to now turn
 
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
over discussion to representative Hill
 
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
who has drafted some ideas
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
um that uh
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
he would like to see that would tighten
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
some of that up it doesn't remove
 
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
anything that the Senate's done it just
 
01:37:38.689 --> 01:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
adds to it and then we can have
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
discussions based on that
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
all right just FYI I might have to skip
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
out because I'm in another Community
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
Conference and we're adjourned until 3
 
01:37:52.669 --> 01:37:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh 35 and I'm one minute over so I'm all
 
01:37:52.679 --> 01:37:55.189 align:start position:0%
uh 35 and I'm one minute over so I'm all
yours

01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
thanks and thanks for uh taking the time
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
to have this discussion with the house
 
01:38:04.070 --> 01:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
the house bill passed uh 271 to 100 I
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
think or something somewhere in those
 
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
range what we wanted to do was take
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully come to a an agreement
 
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
here on some of the things that were
 
01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:18.590 align:start position:0%
here on some of the things that were
um

01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
of most interest by the house members
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
which was the cleanup
 
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
um that that's what resulted in the 271
 
01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:27.890 align:start position:0%
um that that's what resulted in the 271
votes

01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
votes
 
01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
I actually think that may have been the
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill that was the most bipartisan vote
 
01:38:35.689 --> 01:38:35.699 align:start position:0%
that we took all year quite frankly
 
01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
um aside from the unanimous votes of uh
 
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
of the budget and so on
 
01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:42.830 align:start position:0%
of the budget and so on
um

01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
so what I put together is um is some
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
draft language
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
um it had OLS put it together a couple
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
of things I still find that are are
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
problematic one is that it says it
 
01:38:59.209 --> 01:38:59.219 align:start position:0%
amends the bill by replacing all after
 
01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
the enacting Clause with the following
 
01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
that was not the intention and that was
 
01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
not what was conveyed the goal was to
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
keep the Senate version in place
 
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
however to address the immediacy of the
 
01:39:18.709 --> 01:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
problem which which is that we currently
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
have and are continuing to add to the
 
01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
amount of contamination in terms of
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
derelict fishing gear in our Coastal
 
01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:30.050 align:start position:0%
derelict fishing gear in our Coastal
Waters

01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
Waters
 
01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:30.830 align:start position:0%
Waters
um

01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
the goal and and and subsequently to the
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
or in addition to that and and primarily
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
the concern of the diving Community
 
01:39:45.610 --> 01:39:45.620 align:start position:0%
anyway is that there are animals dying
 
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
continuously from that derelict fishing
 
01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.129 align:start position:0%
continuously from that derelict fishing
gear

01:39:49.129 --> 01:39:49.139 align:start position:0%
gear
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh we we have pictures here of of divers
 
01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
that took a 30-minute dive and found uh
 
01:39:58.729 --> 01:39:58.739 align:start position:0%
two traps with uh with animals live
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
animals in them and I'm sure the Senate
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
is aware that uh this is an ongoing
 
01:40:08.450 --> 01:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
problem this is a is a worldwide problem
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a worldwide problem
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
everywhere except New Hampshire for some
 
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:13.370 align:start position:0%
everywhere except New Hampshire for some
reason

01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
um so we're hoping that uh the Senate is
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
able to agree that there is urgency to
 
01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
this to this problem
 
01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:22.729 align:start position:0%
this to this problem
um

01:40:22.729 --> 01:40:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
there were two what we've done in this
 
01:40:28.370 --> 01:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
draft amendment is basically
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
um begin begin the process now not
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
um not take at face value the idea of
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
the instructions by the Senate two
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
fishing game to create a process to
 
01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
create some kind of a program on the
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
hope that that's will be something that
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
will work next year
 
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair yes representative I just
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh point out to the members
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
here sitting at the table on both sides
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
Senate and House that the amendment is
 
01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
not something we can vote on now as it's
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
written because there are mistakes with
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
it it was just ideas that we want to
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
discuss adding drafting the amendment
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
that will add to the end of the Senate
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
side so there's two valid uh pertinent
 
01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
paragraphs in that and I would like uh
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Hill to read those so
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
that the members can be aware of what
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
the the suggestion is so we can then
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
move forward and discuss it so you don't
 
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
want me to just pass them out
 
01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
all right we can pass them out so they
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
can refer to them but I'd like we can't
 
01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
vote on it
 
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
um it's it's written improperly so it's
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
something that we can
 
01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:44.780 align:start position:0%
Go Diego Senator okay fine
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
so if you could point out those two
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
sections uh
 
01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:51.229 align:start position:0%
sections uh
sure

01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
um the news sections would um would deal
 
01:41:58.850 --> 01:41:58.860 align:start position:0%
with um the rapid response that's needed
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
um we have we have people in the water
 
01:42:01.679 --> 01:42:02.930 align:start position:0%
um we have we have people in the water
now

01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
um and we have uh people who are capable
 
01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:09.659 align:start position:0%
of of identifying where these traps are
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
we have pages and pages of uh of traps
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
that are obviously derelict traps
 
01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:17.209 align:start position:0%
that are obviously derelict traps
um

01:42:17.209 --> 01:42:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:19.930 --> 01:42:19.940 align:start position:0%
and there would be no reason for
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
divers to be able to begin locating
 
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:27.080 align:start position:0%
where where these traps are
 
01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
and there would be no reason why the
 
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
live animals that are contained within
 
01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:35.340 align:start position:0%
those traps can't be released this
 
01:42:35.340 --> 01:42:36.050 align:start position:0%
those traps can't be released this
summer

01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
so representative just just for our
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
reference we're looking really
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
specifically at section two beginning on
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
line 15. and continuing through section
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
three on page two all the way over to
 
01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:51.659 align:start position:0%
page line three on page three so it'd be
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
basically sections two and three because
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
my quick look it looks like the section
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
four and five were the parts of the
 
01:43:00.129 --> 01:43:00.139 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that were already there
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
four and five
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
um so it looks like it begins on line 15
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
page one section two news that's where
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
the new the new language starts yep
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
um but again we're not voting on no I'm
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
just for us to consider right so that
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
we're not reading through all the things
 
01:43:17.689 --> 01:43:17.699 align:start position:0%
that we don't need anything above line
 
01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
15 you need to ignore because the
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
findings somehow got messed up in in the
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
drafting although I think that finding
 
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
four being added into there would not be
 
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
a bad thing which says since derelict
 
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
fishing gear contains microplastics a
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
possible funding source might be the
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
Monsanto settlement funding uh that's
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
just a direction of of uh a heads up as
 
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
to where some of the funding might come
 
01:43:43.729 --> 01:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
from but we haven't also told them to
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
directed them to go ask them for money
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
from NOAA which we know that they can
 
01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
get as well so it's not necessary but it
 
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
is a good heads up but for the purposes
 
01:43:54.169 --> 01:43:54.179 align:start position:0%
of this conversation for the purposes of
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
this conversation we need to look at
 
01:43:59.290 --> 01:43:59.300 align:start position:0%
line 15 on uh which has the
 
01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
sections that he was
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
talking about adding in
 
01:44:09.290 --> 01:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
um so so it does seem that the new
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
sections are as you stated referral from
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
15 to 15 page one to page two yep and
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
then it looks like the Senate language
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
is all the remaining oh I see what the
 
01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
okay so we got mixed in there
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
okay I see so there's nothing no to my
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge there was nothing that was
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
taken out of the Senate language no but
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
something additional was added to sex to
 
01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
finding three Roman numeral three which
 
01:44:44.209 --> 01:44:44.219 align:start position:0%
wasn't there and somehow appeared there
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
which isn't it isn't a finding so it
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong there
 
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
regardless it's a Direction
 
01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
so that should not be there either
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
from the Senate finding three said a
 
01:45:01.250 --> 01:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
useful component of the cleanup effort
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
is in addition to stakeholders to assist
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
in is in the addition of stakeholders to
 
01:45:07.070 --> 01:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
assist in the removal of derelict
 
01:45:09.169 --> 01:45:09.179 align:start position:0%
fishing gear period
 
01:45:11.149 --> 01:45:11.159 align:start position:0%
and somehow this other bit got added on
 
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
saying stakeholders assisting with the
 
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
cleanup of derelict fishing gear are
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
thereby authorized to physically touch
 
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's a Direction that's not a finding
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't belong in there that
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
sentence should be that whole thing
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
somehow crept into a finding when it
 
01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
so finding number four talks about a
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
different funding source uh one of the
 
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
possible funding sources but the bill
 
01:45:40.729 --> 01:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
allocates some funding already yeah the
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill it's extends General funds correct
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is the house suggesting that we
 
01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
change it would be in addition nope it
 
01:45:52.010 --> 01:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
would just be additional funding sources
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
and that's still in here I believe
 
01:45:55.609 --> 01:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
because we left the we left the
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
allocation of funds that the Senate put
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
in but we're also suggesting there's
 
01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:02.820 align:start position:0%
other funds available if they need more
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
and in fact here here's even an article
 
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
on another funding source which is the
 
01:46:10.930 --> 01:46:10.940 align:start position:0%
NOAA marine debris program
 
01:46:16.129 --> 01:46:16.139 align:start position:0%
which Maine received 143 139 because
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
they applied for it and we have not yet
 
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
applied for any of that NOAA money but
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
it's being dispersed to all kinds of
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
States uh even Mexico even even we gave
 
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
some to Mexico from Noah uh half a
 
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars to clean up their
 
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
derelict fishing gear and such so we we
 
01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
have other funding sources that could
 
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
double or triple the amount of money
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
that they have to work with to get the
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
problem solved and so we're just
 
01:46:42.109 --> 01:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
throwing out if if we seed it with the
 
01:46:43.729 --> 01:46:43.739 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand you have other sources
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
you can go get money from as well let's
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
go get it done and there's actually
 
01:46:49.729 --> 01:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
Federal money that
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
um I think has been voted on an
 
01:46:53.159 --> 01:46:54.950 align:start position:0%
um I think has been voted on an
authorized

01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
in the millions coming to New Hampshire
 
01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:00.659 align:start position:0%
specifically for Coastal cleanup
 
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
so money shouldn't be an issue in this
 
01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.169 align:start position:0%
so money shouldn't be an issue in this
um

01:47:06.169 --> 01:47:06.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:09.410 --> 01:47:09.420 align:start position:0%
the the problem that I have as a House
 
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
member is that we're waiting
 
01:47:16.250 --> 01:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and hoping that that a a process will
 
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
take place that could have taken place
 
01:47:20.930 --> 01:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
all the way from 1971 when we cut we
 
01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
have current rsas that allow this to
 
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
already exist
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
and Heaven
 
01:47:29.689 --> 01:47:29.699 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to me urgency is needed
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
and direction is needed from the house
 
01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
and the Senate and that's hopefully what
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
the amended uh draft uh Amendment to the
 
01:47:42.609 --> 01:47:42.619 align:start position:0%
Senate language would would take place
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
we have two ideas of how this can happen
 
01:47:50.649 --> 01:47:50.659 align:start position:0%
um the this the fishing game already
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
utilizes SurveyMonkey for a striped bass
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
program so there's no reason when we
 
01:47:59.570 --> 01:47:59.580 align:start position:0%
couldn't adapt that to utilize for
 
01:48:03.370 --> 01:48:03.380 align:start position:0%
divers to look to locate and Report
 
01:48:06.609 --> 01:48:06.619 align:start position:0%
where these where these traps are
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
that could be happening
 
01:48:09.119 --> 01:48:10.070 align:start position:0%
that could be happening
um

01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:12.179 align:start position:0%
how by the weekend as far as I'm
 
01:48:12.179 --> 01:48:13.250 align:start position:0%
how by the weekend as far as I'm
concerned

01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
um and uh and there's also no reason why
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
um these as the divers who are already
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
in these Waters now
 
01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:22.850 align:start position:0%
in these Waters now
um

01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
and have been there's no reason why when
 
01:48:28.970 --> 01:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
they come upon derelict traps that have
 
01:48:32.290 --> 01:48:32.300 align:start position:0%
no surface buoy and or
 
01:48:34.729 --> 01:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
tags that are from previous years
 
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why those can't be
 
01:48:39.410 --> 01:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
identified and
 
01:48:42.290 --> 01:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
um and opened and have the animals that
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
are trapped inside and will certainly
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
starve and die
 
01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:48.179 align:start position:0%
be released
 
01:48:48.179 --> 01:48:49.550 align:start position:0%
be released
so

01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:52.910 --> 01:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's the um the Crux of the
 
01:48:54.129 --> 01:48:54.139 align:start position:0%
additional language
 
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
is do we want to amend the Senate
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
language to allow
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
live animals that will certainly starve
 
01:49:06.050 --> 01:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
to death this summer be able to be
 
01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
released and those additional traps be
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
located and reported to the fishing game
 
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:18.830 --> 01:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
yes Senator thank you I have a couple of
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
questions one who are the defined
 
01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.139 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that you mentioned
 
01:49:26.689 --> 01:49:26.699 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
um the programs that are ongoing in
 
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.189 align:start position:0%
um the programs that are ongoing in
States

01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
States
 
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
um bordering us
 
01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
um indicate that the stakeholders are
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
the lobster the lobstering industry
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
themselves The Fish and Game the diver
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
the dive community and any number of
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
volunteers there are uh main main has an
 
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
extensive program and he came and and
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
one of those non-profits came and
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
testified to the Senate and to the house
 
01:50:00.109 --> 01:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
um couldn't come to this event but uh
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
because he's busy pulling uh I think 415
 
01:50:06.169 --> 01:50:06.179 align:start position:0%
traps out of uh Boothbay Harbor the last
 
01:50:06.179 --> 01:50:07.729 align:start position:0%
traps out of uh Boothbay Harbor the last
weekend

01:50:07.729 --> 01:50:07.739 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
um they are they are ongoing in every
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
state around us except
 
01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:15.530 align:start position:0%
state around us except
us

01:50:15.530 --> 01:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
and in fact it has the the situation in
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
Maine is is a actually a good model of
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
how this works with cooperation but to
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
get to that point we need to we need to
 
01:50:27.950 --> 01:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
have the stakeholders admit that there
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
is a problem which some of the
 
01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:32.219 align:start position:0%
stakeholders have been reluctant to do
 
01:50:35.450 --> 01:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
and so we need to sort of prod along the
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
process uh in my eyes to make sure that
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
we start to recognize the problem exists
 
01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
we start to identify where they're
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
located and we start removing some of
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
them so yes Senator you have another
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
yeah I do
 
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the timing so let's say
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
this gets signed July 1st within 60 days
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game has to issue an RFP
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
then that has to be issued for 30 days
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a review process
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
how how do we
 
01:51:17.450 --> 01:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
how does this make it
 
01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:18.830 align:start position:0%
how does this make it
faster

01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
faster
 
01:51:21.169 --> 01:51:21.179 align:start position:0%
I mean it's I think about the timing of
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
getting things done it looks like 2024.
 
01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
pretty much I don't disagree with you
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
for setting up the formal program
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
that fish and games directed in here to
 
01:51:32.159 --> 01:51:33.010 align:start position:0%
that fish and games directed in here to
do

01:51:33.010 --> 01:51:33.020 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:51:35.990 --> 01:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime while those
 
01:51:38.209 --> 01:51:38.219 align:start position:0%
processes are going on while the RFP is
 
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
out there's nothing preventing us if we
 
01:51:44.209 --> 01:51:44.219 align:start position:0%
give the divers permission to go out and
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
locate the traps identify where they are
 
01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
and report them to start Gathering that
 
01:51:49.080 --> 01:51:50.330 align:start position:0%
and report them to start Gathering that
data

01:51:50.330 --> 01:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:51:52.609 --> 01:51:52.619 align:start position:0%
first of all to gather the data of where
 
01:51:55.010 --> 01:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
they're located and how extensive the
 
01:51:57.290 --> 01:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
problem is but two on the second side
 
01:51:59.450 --> 01:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
end of things when they encounter these
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
traps we need to give the divers
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
permission to release those animals
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
that's the parts that get done earlier
 
01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
the formal program can't be just because
 
01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the logistics of the whole thing as
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
you stated but the free portion of
 
01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
having the volunteer divers providing
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
this information shouldn't be held up
 
01:52:19.729 --> 01:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
until the program's formal we should be
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
having those those uh Gathering that
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
data now where are the traps located all
 
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
the ones we know about get them mapped
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
out it'll help with the crafting of the
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
formal program I think so is that
 
01:52:36.169 --> 01:52:36.179 align:start position:0%
starting on line 29 of page one where
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
the divers can
 
01:52:41.149 --> 01:52:41.159 align:start position:0%
right away yes
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
yep floating a marker to the top to show
 
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:45.780 align:start position:0%
where the Trap is located when they
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
ing is it's a pilot program has Maine
 
01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.090 align:start position:0%
ing is it's a pilot program has Maine
issued

01:52:59.090 --> 01:52:59.100 align:start position:0%
issued
 
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
any data on what the results of that
 
01:53:05.390 --> 01:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
program we have we have data to this
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
point I believe representative Hill
 
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
you've got that data right you know some
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
of what the they did I'll let you speak
 
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
to that thank you
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
all we're talking about is one
 
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
organization at this point which was
 
01:53:21.649 --> 01:53:21.659 align:start position:0%
Oceans wide
 
01:53:21.659 --> 01:53:22.390 align:start position:0%
Oceans wide
um

01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:26.689 --> 01:53:26.699 align:start position:0%
oceans wide w-i-d-e
 
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
um they are operating out of Boothbay
 
01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:30.169 align:start position:0%
um they are operating out of Boothbay
Harbor

01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:30.179 align:start position:0%
Harbor
 
01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
and I think Damariscotta
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
um and uh and they have
 
01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:39.290 align:start position:0%
um and uh and they have
um

01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
mountains of information that he left
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
off for us in testimony it's actually in
 
01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate record as well uh of of their
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
work that they did over the last year
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they've continued this year they're
 
01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
actually doing it as a volunteer program
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
with some of the high schools they're
 
01:54:00.050 --> 01:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
getting students certified for scuba
 
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
they are operating very very similarly
 
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
to the to the proposal here with the
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
marker boys that uh that exist in this
 
01:54:10.930 --> 01:54:10.940 align:start position:0%
draft language
 
01:54:15.050 --> 01:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
they have reported to us that two-thirds
 
01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
of the traps that they bring up
 
01:54:21.590 --> 01:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
have have live animals in them
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the ones that don't have live
 
01:54:26.149 --> 01:54:26.159 align:start position:0%
animals in them have
 
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
um remnants of animals in them
 
01:54:32.330 --> 01:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
so that's where some of the the actual
 
01:54:34.729 --> 01:54:34.739 align:start position:0%
data is coming from
 
01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
um they are reporting that they have
 
01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:38.810 align:start position:0%
um they are reporting that they have
work

01:54:38.810 --> 01:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
um just inside Boothbay Harbor for the
 
01:54:43.189 --> 01:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
rest of their career if they didn't
 
01:54:43.199 --> 01:54:44.510 align:start position:0%
rest of their career if they didn't
expand

01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
expand
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
um and they're coming up with numbers
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
um that are roughly what the um national
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
uh Oceanic and uh
 
01:54:56.410 --> 01:54:56.420 align:start position:0%
what is it Oceanic
 
01:54:59.330 --> 01:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
atmospheric and Association or
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
Administration says and of roughly the
 
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
10 percent number and that's where that
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
comes of 10 percent of the traps that
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
are do you do you remember what they
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
said they pulled out of Boothbay Harbor
 
01:55:13.490 --> 01:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
last summer I think it was in the close
 
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
to half a million traps was it not
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I can't swear that it was in my
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
testimony but yeah I can't remember the
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
numbers but we do have those numbers
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
they are in the record in the Senate
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
they are in the record in the house from
 
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
the committee as well Mr chair yes
 
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
Senator we need about a 10 minute break
 
01:55:32.689 --> 01:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we need to go have a
 
01:55:32.699 --> 01:55:34.030 align:start position:0%
okay yeah we need to go have a
discussion

01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
I got another committee at conference at
 
01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:37.750 align:start position:0%
I got another committee at conference at
11.

01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
11.
 
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
sure sorry we're all jammed pretty tight
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
but we need we need about a 10 minute
 
01:55:45.410 --> 01:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
recess we can take a 10 minute recess
 
01:55:49.689 --> 01:55:49.699 align:start position:0%
um and come back at uh I call it 11 1105
 
01:55:53.149 --> 01:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
that's fine that's fine thanks um
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
all right give us about 10. sure
 
02:10:01.810 --> 02:10:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.729 --> 02:10:04.739 align:start position:0%
all right we are back in committee
 
02:10:04.739 --> 02:10:06.770 align:start position:0%
all right we are back in committee
conference

02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
conference
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to point out that the
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
committee researcher has dropped off the
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
testimony for the State House from
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
Ocean's wide
 
02:10:16.850 --> 02:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to direct people to take a
 
02:10:19.250 --> 02:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
look uh at one of the more interesting
 
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
facts because it it relates to what
 
02:10:22.729 --> 02:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
we're talking about about starting to
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
get data gathered now and that's uh page
 
02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
two d
 
02:10:32.089 --> 02:10:32.099 align:start position:0%
uh subsection 4 Roman numeral four
 
02:10:35.030 --> 02:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
item one survey the initial survey found
 
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
that was an initial survey just in the
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
Boothbay Harbor area
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of what we're talking
 
02:10:50.089 --> 02:10:50.099 align:start position:0%
about when we say that we'd like to
 
02:10:50.099 --> 02:10:50.930 align:start position:0%
about when we say that we'd like to
um

02:10:50.930 --> 02:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:53.689 --> 02:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
amend the Senate's Language by adding on
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
something that gets us started sooner
 
02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:57.830 align:start position:0%
something that gets us started sooner
um

02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:00.530 --> 02:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
we would like I think that
 
02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
using our free volunteer resources of
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
the divers to start collecting that data
 
02:11:07.790 --> 02:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost us anything and doesn't
 
02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
need to wait for the formal program
 
02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
so I want to summarize some of the
 
02:11:13.490 --> 02:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
discussion that we've been having so far
 
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
because I was talking with
 
02:11:18.070 --> 02:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative pair here and and um
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
there is a way to summarize this
 
02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
we would like to amend the Senate's bill
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
to allow us to get started earlier with
 
02:11:28.609 --> 02:11:28.619 align:start position:0%
the collecting of data and the freeing
 
02:11:31.010 --> 02:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
of Trapped animals when and if that is
 
02:11:33.229 --> 02:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
found by a diver in a trap that is
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise irretrievable so that the
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
animal doesn't die that's it and however
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
we find a way to come to that agreement
 
02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
we would be appreciative if we can get
 
02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:45.109 align:start position:0%
we would be appreciative if we can get
there

02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:11:48.050 --> 02:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
so we had a discussion when we were out
 
02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:49.010 align:start position:0%
so we had a discussion when we were out
um

02:11:49.010 --> 02:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:51.410 --> 02:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
none of us are comfortable at this point
 
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
and adding in allowing scuba divers to
 
02:11:56.209 --> 02:11:56.219 align:start position:0%
go in and touch the traps that are under
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
there right now we're all struggling
 
02:11:59.689 --> 02:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
with that one a bit and that was one of
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
the things that I wanted to discuss with
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
the captain Eastman about the current
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
law and it would be contradictory and
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
he'll have to tell you which one it is
 
02:12:08.450 --> 02:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
because I don't remember but it would be
 
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
contradictory to current law to allow
 
02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
them to touch the traps that are there
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
and release the animals I I understand
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're saying I I get it
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
unless it's done under a program and
 
02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
that's how that's how we'd have to do it
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's why and I we agree it's
 
02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
imperative to get this program moving as
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible
 
02:12:30.649 --> 02:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
one of the the thought that we had is
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I understand you're concerned about
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
there not being any guard wheels that we
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
weren't very specific about how they had
 
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
to do it just that it had to get done
 
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
so the thought that we had from the
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
Senate side I guess what we'd propose is
 
02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:45.350 align:start position:0%
Senate side I guess what we'd propose is
um

02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:49.069 --> 02:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
if you take um and require a report to
 
02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
be done or them come back to us and tell
 
02:12:54.770 --> 02:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
us how they're going to do this by
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
September 30th that gives them
 
02:12:59.689 --> 02:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
essentially I mean it's just supposed to
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
take effect July 1st I don't know if
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to get signed by July 1st or
 
02:13:04.250 --> 02:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
not but it's going to get signed in July
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to give them you know all the
 
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
rest of July August and September to
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
come back and say this is how we're
 
02:13:12.649 --> 02:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
going to do this this is how we're going
 
02:13:15.709 --> 02:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
to implement what the legislature and
 
02:13:18.109 --> 02:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
the governor is directing us to do and
 
02:13:20.209 --> 02:13:20.219 align:start position:0%
that gives us some guardrails on how we
 
02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
do this and we'd require them to report
 
02:13:23.569 --> 02:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
back to
 
02:13:25.250 --> 02:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
you know the respective committees I
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
guess it would be energy and fish and
 
02:13:29.149 --> 02:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
game on on both sides of the aisle so we
 
02:13:30.830 --> 02:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
did draft up some language if you'd like
 
02:13:32.450 --> 02:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
us to read it to you and tell you what
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
it says I would love that I think that
 
02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
this is um this is a satisfying part of
 
02:13:37.970 --> 02:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
the problem that I had
 
02:13:40.850 --> 02:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
um and and giving us some accountability
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to defer to Senator since we
 
02:13:44.270 --> 02:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
both scratched down but well I was
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
um did your handwriting improve or get
 
02:13:53.569 --> 02:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.930 --> 02:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
so essentially would be adding to the
 
02:14:01.069 --> 02:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
Senate version of Roman 4. of section
 
02:14:01.079 --> 02:14:02.569 align:start position:0%
Senate version of Roman 4. of section
two

02:14:02.569 --> 02:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:14:06.770 --> 02:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
and it would say the executive director
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
shall submit a report to the
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
chairpersons of the House and Senate
 
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
committees with jurisdiction over the
 
02:14:19.250 --> 02:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
derelict fishing gear cleanup by
 
02:14:21.290 --> 02:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
September 30th
 
02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:24.589 align:start position:0%
September 30th
2023

02:14:24.589 --> 02:14:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:28.370 --> 02:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
the report shall include but not being
 
02:14:32.510 --> 02:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
limited to a strategic plan for
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
implementing the derelict fishing gear
 
02:14:39.069 --> 02:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
cleanup program including
 
02:14:43.609 --> 02:14:43.619 align:start position:0%
projected priming costs
 
02:14:50.450 --> 02:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:51.709 align:start position:0%
 
committee

02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:14:55.330 --> 02:14:55.340 align:start position:0%
a couple of quick comments
 
02:14:59.209 --> 02:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
that deadline where is where is that in
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
relation to our if there's something in
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
that report we don't like and we think
 
02:15:07.250 --> 02:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be additional
 
02:15:09.530 --> 02:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
legislation filed what is our deadline
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
for filing that legislation for next
 
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
term we have November from our side but
 
02:15:16.189 --> 02:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the Senate does they
 
02:15:17.629 --> 02:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
have no deadline they can do whatever
 
02:15:20.209 --> 02:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be I think ours is
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
September owner yeah I thought it was
 
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
sign off
 
02:15:27.770 --> 02:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
and final language is November 30th and
 
02:15:29.569 --> 02:15:29.579 align:start position:0%
certainly any place older bill could be
 
02:15:29.579 --> 02:15:31.609 align:start position:0%
certainly any place older bill could be
filed

02:15:31.609 --> 02:15:31.619 align:start position:0%
filed
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
to if we fear there may be concerns you
 
02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
you see my point yes if there's
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
something that comes in with their their
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
proposal or their suggestion and we're
 
02:15:46.729 --> 02:15:46.739 align:start position:0%
also pretty easily available to file a
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
late bill that's right absolutely always
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
approve well that's what I mean I mean
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's more on the house side I think the
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
ability is there if there's something in
 
02:15:58.129 --> 02:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
the report we really felt compelled that
 
02:16:00.410 --> 02:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
needed to be or needed to be compelled
 
02:16:03.410 --> 02:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
by legislation I'm not I would hope that
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be anything that
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
egregious in the well no I mean it may
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
not be even
 
02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:10.370 align:start position:0%
not be even
that

02:16:10.370 --> 02:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
aspect but what if something that they
 
02:16:15.290 --> 02:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
want to accomplish requires us to change
 
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
an existing law if they want to do
 
02:16:21.050 --> 02:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
something to implement the plan that
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be the best way to do it and it
 
02:16:25.550 --> 02:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
requires us amending an RSA we need to
 
02:16:27.410 --> 02:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
be able to take that action and we
 
02:16:28.609 --> 02:16:28.619 align:start position:0%
certainly would have the ability to do
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
that but with a late file Bill if not in
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
the normal filing bill on the Senate
 
02:16:34.570 --> 02:16:34.580 align:start position:0%
side we'd definitely be able to do that
 
02:16:36.650 --> 02:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
we are always very gracious about
 
02:16:39.410 --> 02:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
granting that to any member that applies
 
02:16:42.530 --> 02:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you secondarily
 
02:16:45.770 --> 02:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
um the other the other concern I have is
 
02:16:47.570 --> 02:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:16:50.330 --> 02:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
this was all this has all been possible
 
02:16:53.810 --> 02:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
to do by you know we're giving Fish and
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
Game executive director until September
 
02:16:56.399 --> 02:16:57.830 align:start position:0%
Game executive director until September
30th

02:16:57.830 --> 02:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
30th
 
02:17:00.889 --> 02:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
they've had the ability since 1971 to be
 
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
able to do this so I'm not really sure
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:17:10.009 --> 02:17:10.019 align:start position:0%
I have great confidence in
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
you could great confidence in the in the
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
outcome this
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
the rest of the world understands that
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
these things exist and until we brought
 
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
this up this year all of a sudden it
 
02:17:26.330 --> 02:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
seems to be first it was it was pointed
 
02:17:29.150 --> 02:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
out that they don't exist and and only
 
02:17:32.209 --> 02:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
begrudgingly are they agreeing to this
 
02:17:36.349 --> 02:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
so it would I I hesitate to say oh yeah
 
02:17:38.570 --> 02:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
well why September 30th we'll end up
 
02:17:42.349 --> 02:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
with just exactly the program we need
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
well I would say representative that
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
while you may be right there may have
 
02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
been a law in the books since the early
 
02:17:49.250 --> 02:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
70s I would say now Fish and Game
 
02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:50.450 align:start position:0%
70s I would say now Fish and Game
clearly

02:17:50.450 --> 02:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
is having the directive from the
 
02:17:53.810 --> 02:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
legislature and from the governor's
 
02:17:56.270 --> 02:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
office that there is this is an urgent
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
thing that needs to be addressed and it
 
02:17:59.089 --> 02:17:59.099 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed now this this
 
02:18:01.310 --> 02:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
cleanup and we're passing this program
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're giving them the money to do it
 
02:18:04.610 --> 02:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
there's a to me there's a big difference
 
02:18:06.290 --> 02:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
between giving someone the authority to
 
02:18:08.690 --> 02:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
do it and giving them money and saying
 
02:18:10.370 --> 02:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
you will do this with the money for me
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's a much stronger message and and I
 
02:18:13.849 --> 02:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
think we're making that statement as a
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislature I think the governor has
 
02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
made it very clear that he has an
 
02:18:19.129 --> 02:18:19.139 align:start position:0%
interest in seeing this move forward and
 
02:18:21.530 --> 02:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
I think from my conversations with the
 
02:18:23.389 --> 02:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
direct director Mason with Colonel
 
02:18:25.070 --> 02:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
Jordan and with Captain Eastman that
 
02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
they all understand that we're serious
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
about this and they need to be
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue I do want to
 
02:18:32.209 --> 02:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
clarify just for those who haven't seen
 
02:18:33.770 --> 02:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
what he's talking about with there being
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
a loss since 1971
 
02:18:39.049 --> 02:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
um what he's referring to is uh 211
 
02:18:42.530 --> 02:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
colon 72 which is um damages
 
02:18:44.270 --> 02:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
determination by Department of Fish and
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
Game upon learning of damage to fish and
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
other Aquatic Life or wildlife and or
 
02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
their habitat occasioned by
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
contamination the executive director of
 
02:18:53.570 --> 02:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
the Department of Fish and Game or his
 
02:18:55.370 --> 02:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
designated agent shall investigate and
 
02:18:57.530 --> 02:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
determine the party responsible and it
 
02:18:59.209 --> 02:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
goes on from there so it's it's talking
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
about contamination
 
02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:02.750 align:start position:0%
about contamination
which

02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
these obviously are derelict fishing
 
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
gear whether it be Nets that got tangled
 
02:19:10.009 --> 02:19:10.019 align:start position:0%
up down there are the same type of
 
02:19:14.450 --> 02:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
contamination to the area as uh somebody
 
02:19:16.129 --> 02:19:16.139 align:start position:0%
driving a vehicle in and plunging that
 
02:19:18.650 --> 02:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
underwater too you know it's it's
 
02:19:20.530 --> 02:19:20.540 align:start position:0%
um it's still contamination to their
 
02:19:24.889 --> 02:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
habitat and so in a way they've had this
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
since 71 it wasn't targeted specifically
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
it was talking about any contamination
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
so I think now we're being more targeted
 
02:19:37.009 --> 02:19:37.019 align:start position:0%
we're also providing funding and a
 
02:19:37.019 --> 02:19:38.150 align:start position:0%
we're also providing funding and a
directive

02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
directive
 
02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
which I think gives a little more
 
02:19:43.310 --> 02:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
um strength to our argument and we've
 
02:19:44.810 --> 02:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
seen the willingness of the governor to
 
02:19:46.490 --> 02:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
sign it when it gets to his desk which
 
02:19:49.310 --> 02:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
shows everyone involved it's a serious
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
issue well I would say that with uh in
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
my conversations in navigating through
 
02:19:58.490 --> 02:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
this process no pun intended that um we
 
02:20:00.830 --> 02:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's definitely an interest with from
 
02:20:02.810 --> 02:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
the fishing industry from the lobsterman
 
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
to participate and clean up they're
 
02:20:06.889 --> 02:20:06.899 align:start position:0%
doing it now they they want to do it
 
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
more they don't want their gear there if
 
02:20:09.650 --> 02:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be it you know
 
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
whatever is there they're willing to
 
02:20:13.310 --> 02:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
help clean up we've had that commitment
 
02:20:14.810 --> 02:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
from them we've had a commitment from
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
fish and game that they're willing to
 
02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
take this this program and implement it
 
02:20:22.610 --> 02:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
and see what needs to be there and so I
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm confident representative I realize I
 
02:20:26.929 --> 02:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
understand your skepticism I fully
 
02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:29.220 align:start position:0%
respect that I'm confident that we have
 
02:20:31.730 --> 02:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
a plan in place or a program that I'm
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
hopeful is going to go forward and do
 
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
what it's supposed to
 
02:20:37.490 --> 02:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
I I like what what you've done with the
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
draft language I have a suggestion of
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
something else that I think I maybe we
 
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
want to consider putting in there
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
because it was successful in Indonesia
 
02:20:47.809 --> 02:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
when I was talking with the group from
 
02:20:49.370 --> 02:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
Indonesia it's also been one of the
 
02:20:51.230 --> 02:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
successful Parts about the cleanup that
 
02:20:53.650 --> 02:20:53.660 align:start position:0%
they're doing in Maine with this is
 
02:20:56.330 --> 02:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
preventing future
 
02:20:58.910 --> 02:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
dumping of gear that's no longer wanted
 
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
by making sure that part of this funding
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
is used to create and sustain a
 
02:21:08.090 --> 02:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
recycling program for the fishing gear
 
02:21:09.770 --> 02:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
um so that we can have
 
02:21:12.770 --> 02:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
two or more Central points that any
 
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
fisherman lobsterman or what have you
 
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
can dump off their unwanted gear uh and
 
02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
know that it's going to be taken care of
 
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
and recycled so that there's no issue
 
02:21:24.830 --> 02:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
with maybe a landfill that's rejecting
 
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
taking Lobby lobster traps and somebody
 
02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
decides to drive out in a boat and dump
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
stuff with no longer having identifying
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
marks on it
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I I'm not saying that
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
happens here but it it has been found to
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
be the case when they were the
 
02:21:41.450 --> 02:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
Indonesians were here talking they said
 
02:21:43.130 --> 02:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest issues they had was
 
02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
some of the coastal
 
02:21:47.570 --> 02:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
contamination was actually deliberately
 
02:21:50.330 --> 02:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
dumped and they've had none of that
 
02:21:52.490 --> 02:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
happening since they've instituted the
 
02:21:53.929 --> 02:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
recycling program
 
02:21:55.490 --> 02:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
so I think that that's a component we
 
02:21:58.670 --> 02:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
should also look at is preventing future
 
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
um purposeful dumping of anything by
 
02:22:08.030 --> 02:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh yes thank you I
 
02:22:13.790 --> 02:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
have a question is the
 
02:22:17.090 --> 02:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
um is there any reason that uh informal
 
02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:18.650 align:start position:0%
um is there any reason that uh informal
uh

02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:21.410 --> 02:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
rocking and and releasing a fish can't
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
be done by dive groups and uh and clubs
 
02:22:27.710 --> 02:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
sort of a semi-organized maybe we don't
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
want you know representative spleen and
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
myself to decide we're going scuba
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
diving next weekend and we'll go check
 
02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
for for traps but if uh
 
02:22:39.770 --> 02:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
your uh dive shop wanted to organize a
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
group of people that would go out and
 
02:22:44.690 --> 02:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
look for traps and and release animals
 
02:22:46.370 --> 02:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
you know for the for the fish and
 
02:22:48.650 --> 02:22:48.660 align:start position:0%
lobsters and crabs and everything else
 
02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
that are in these traps it's literally
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die it would be nice to be
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
able to do something
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible now that we're
 
02:22:59.570 --> 02:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
really aware of it but but putting
 
02:23:01.070 --> 02:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
together a formal program is certainly
 
02:23:02.330 --> 02:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
going to take time would the chair
 
02:23:04.010 --> 02:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
entertain letting Captain Eastman answer
 
02:23:06.710 --> 02:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
that question I would uh if you'd like
 
02:23:08.690 --> 02:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
to come up to the microphone captain
 
02:23:10.130 --> 02:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
and the only reason I ask is because
 
02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
there's specific rsas that prohibit it
 
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
and I want him to answer there are and
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard about those uh quite quite a
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
lot but um yeah nobody but the owner of
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
the Trap is allowed to touch it so go
 
02:23:22.849 --> 02:23:22.859 align:start position:0%
for it
 
02:23:22.859 --> 02:23:24.370 align:start position:0%
for it
RSA

02:23:24.370 --> 02:23:24.380 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
21131 is uh was adopted in in 1975 and
 
02:23:32.570 --> 02:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
it says that no one except the owner or
 
02:23:35.330 --> 02:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
a conservation officer can
 
02:23:38.210 --> 02:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
go into that trap or move traps haul
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
traps anything of that nature the
 
02:23:43.010 --> 02:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
wording actually is molest which is a
 
02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
terrible uh way to put it but we see it
 
02:23:47.690 --> 02:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
throughout the fish and game statutes
 
02:23:49.969 --> 02:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
for all kinds of things we're used to it
 
02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
in our committee anyway
 
02:23:51.899 --> 02:23:53.630 align:start position:0%
in our committee anyway
representative

02:23:53.630 --> 02:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:23:55.309 --> 02:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair and I'm glad
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're up the captain Eastman because I
 
02:23:58.750 --> 02:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
did have a question
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
on the similar line
 
02:24:02.809 --> 02:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
um you know it's unusual I did come in
 
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
here already is seeding to the Senate
 
02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:04.969 align:start position:0%
here already is seeding to the Senate
position

02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
uh usually I'm here to defend a house
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
position uh and all we're trying to do
 
02:24:12.230 --> 02:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
is a couple of changes to speed things
 
02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:13.070 align:start position:0%
is a couple of changes to speed things
up

02:24:13.070 --> 02:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:24:14.570 --> 02:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing that you had a conversation
 
02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
with Captain Eastman earlier saying that
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
the no way deal is the ability referring
 
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
back to that statute
 
02:24:25.370 --> 02:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
for divers to touch or Mark derelict
 
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
traps and so my question is
 
02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
these are the derelict traps why can
 
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
they not touch or Mark what is the
 
02:24:35.690 --> 02:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
opposition to them touching and marking
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
a derelict trap or an unretrievable trap
 
02:24:41.210 --> 02:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
my only guess is that it's assumed that
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
our citizens are criminals and if we let
 
02:24:45.230 --> 02:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
them touch the derelict ones now they're
 
02:24:47.809 --> 02:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
going to start opening the doors of the
 
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
ones that are still connected to a buoy
 
02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:52.260 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm for understanding what is the
 
02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:59.270 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm for understanding what is the
fear

02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
the fear is is maybe your own fears that
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
I've seen it snowballed where
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly anyone at this
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
time can see gear down there a diver
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
sees gear they can call and say I see a
 
02:25:14.809 --> 02:25:14.819 align:start position:0%
bunch of derelict gear off a Boar's Head
 
02:25:17.929 --> 02:25:17.939 align:start position:0%
in Hampton and it's at this location we
 
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
can and an officer could come and meet
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
with them and haul gear we I've hauled I
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
was the lieutenant on the Seacoast for
 
02:25:26.330 --> 02:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
six and a half years and we hauled gear
 
02:25:28.910 --> 02:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
that had gone derelict during the you
 
02:25:30.770 --> 02:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
know the winter months in a storm and
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
and um you know that had a buoy attached
 
02:25:35.809 --> 02:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
to it and and was not free-floating and
 
02:25:37.309 --> 02:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
it's not the greatest thing to do in the
 
02:25:39.469 --> 02:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
world I can tell you because it's
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
usually all twisted up and and it's
 
02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
pretty nasty
 
02:25:45.469 --> 02:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
um but certainly I mean this protects
 
02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
our fishermen and that's certainly why
 
02:25:52.849 --> 02:25:52.859 align:start position:0%
we you know continue to to decide with
 
02:25:55.130 --> 02:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
with them and that that they you know
 
02:25:57.650 --> 02:25:57.660 align:start position:0%
people cannot go into lobster traps I
 
02:26:00.050 --> 02:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
had a case one time where some gear in a
 
02:26:02.690 --> 02:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
freak October storm push gear up onto
 
02:26:05.090 --> 02:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach and
 
02:26:07.010 --> 02:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
um there were people on the beach going
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
into the lot into the lobster traps and
 
02:26:11.570 --> 02:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
stealing lobsters out of the traps and
 
02:26:13.010 --> 02:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
then running back to their cars with
 
02:26:15.469 --> 02:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
them and we were called and had to come
 
02:26:18.050 --> 02:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
down and and take lobsters and charge
 
02:26:20.690 --> 02:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
them for for this so
 
02:26:23.690 --> 02:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
what was they they rolled up on the
 
02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
beach everything was there and rolled up
 
02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
onto the beach which is isn't uncommon
 
02:26:29.450 --> 02:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
and that's why you have your your
 
02:26:31.969 --> 02:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
Lobster gear pickup
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
um at this time so
 
02:26:36.010 --> 02:26:36.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:38.510 --> 02:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
also if I may
 
02:26:40.730 --> 02:26:40.740 align:start position:0%
um there is a there was a program when I
 
02:26:42.170 --> 02:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
was on the Seacoast
 
02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
um that was called fishing for energy it
 
02:26:46.250 --> 02:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
was a it was shouldn't knits or steel
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we had
 
02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:48.590 align:start position:0%
and we had
um

02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
dumpsters at that the Yankee Co-op also
 
02:26:53.330 --> 02:26:53.340 align:start position:0%
one at the Portsmouth Co-op that was
 
02:26:57.410 --> 02:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
available for fishermen to put this gear
 
02:26:59.210 --> 02:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
in there and it was hauled away every
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
couple of months so just so that you
 
02:27:02.270 --> 02:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
know I remember the name of that program
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
do you know if it's still running
 
02:27:07.490 --> 02:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
it is it is I know that it's been a
 
02:27:08.690 --> 02:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
couple months since I've been down to
 
02:27:10.250 --> 02:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
the Yankee but there was a dumpster
 
02:27:12.889 --> 02:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
there let me let me
 
02:27:16.670 --> 02:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
um clarify it it is still available it
 
02:27:20.090 --> 02:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
is through the through NOAA they have
 
02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
the fishing for energy and they have the
 
02:27:25.250 --> 02:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
grant programs I have no idea if New
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is participating in it or
 
02:27:29.570 --> 02:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
applying for any of those grants but but
 
02:27:32.090 --> 02:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
the fishing for energy program still
 
02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
exists with Noah yeah they are giving
 
02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
out money to every other state but ours
 
02:27:39.889 --> 02:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
who are at least many
 
02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
we were a part of that program for my
 
02:27:46.090 --> 02:27:46.100 align:start position:0%
time on the Seacoast and I left in 2019
 
02:27:48.830 --> 02:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
I've certainly still seen it there so I
 
02:27:50.450 --> 02:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
know that they do pick it up it is
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
available to there's only one location
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
at the moment right we moved it around
 
02:27:57.170 --> 02:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
um it was at the Portsmouth Co-op and
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
then at the Yankee we had some issues
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
where if you didn't in some areas if you
 
02:28:04.730 --> 02:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
left it it would become a dumpster for
 
02:28:07.610 --> 02:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
for everything else so that that became
 
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
problematic but it was at the Yankee and
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's open all the time for them and
 
02:28:17.450 --> 02:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.950 --> 02:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
Senator what would you like to do
 
02:28:23.450 --> 02:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
there's also one additional thing in in
 
02:28:25.849 --> 02:28:25.859 align:start position:0%
following up on um on representative
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
Walsh's comment
 
02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's also these tags that come that
 
02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
are on
 
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
um on all traps supposedly they are
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
color coded so there would actually be
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
no reason why
 
02:28:45.110 --> 02:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
um a diver couldn't come across if there
 
02:28:46.910 --> 02:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
was any question whether this was an
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
active trap or not
 
02:28:52.730 --> 02:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
if the tag was uh not the the valid trap
 
02:28:52.740 --> 02:28:53.870 align:start position:0%
if the tag was uh not the the valid trap
color

02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
color
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
um it would be easy to determine for the
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
diver that that is a that's been there
 
02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
for for
 
02:29:01.849 --> 02:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:29:01.859 --> 02:29:02.570 align:start position:0%
a year
um

02:29:02.570 --> 02:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
why we would not
 
02:29:05.399 --> 02:29:06.650 align:start position:0%
why we would not
um

02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
release those starving animals uh in
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
those traps is just beyond me I um I'm
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
not sure what we do about that I I agree
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
with you
 
02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we can get to that end
 
02:29:21.349 --> 02:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
point here today with the people that
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
are representing the Senate and the
 
02:29:23.280 --> 02:29:24.349 align:start position:0%
are representing the Senate and the
house

02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
um because it's a question that is going
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:29:30.349 --> 02:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
one that needs a lot more discussion
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
with a lot of members who are not
 
02:29:32.160 --> 02:29:33.770 align:start position:0%
with a lot of members who are not
present

02:29:33.770 --> 02:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:29:35.750 --> 02:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
um just to make sure that we come to a
 
02:29:37.370 --> 02:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
consensus it was in the house position
 
02:29:40.490 --> 02:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
it was in the house position but so I'm
 
02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
sure that on the house side we could
 
02:29:43.849 --> 02:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
probably pass it but I would hate for us
 
02:29:45.410 --> 02:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
to go through all this work and come up
 
02:29:46.849 --> 02:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
with an idea that was going to start
 
02:29:46.859 --> 02:29:48.130 align:start position:0%
with an idea that was going to start
working

02:29:48.130 --> 02:29:48.140 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:29:50.929 --> 02:29:50.939 align:start position:0%
and before we can even get a report
 
02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
filed from fish and game in September
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
have the thing killed in the senate
 
02:29:56.690 --> 02:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
floor because of
 
02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
an overreach here
 
02:30:02.210 --> 02:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's a valid idea I do I
 
02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
just don't know enough about it I know
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
we had some conversation in that other
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
meeting that we had about that
 
02:30:09.530 --> 02:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
and I guess uh
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
I would maybe encourage Captain Eastman
 
02:30:12.889 --> 02:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
to perhaps
 
02:30:14.929 --> 02:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
deliver to the higher ranks so perhaps
 
02:30:16.849 --> 02:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
that could be part of this program is
 
02:30:17.929 --> 02:30:17.939 align:start position:0%
something looking at that and
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
understanding if that can be implemented
 
02:30:21.290 --> 02:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
into the cleanup program that there's a
 
02:30:22.730 --> 02:30:22.740 align:start position:0%
way that could occur so it's just just a
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
thought that I would send you away with
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
and can I ask you to clarify those those
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
colors change yearly like a registration
 
02:30:30.770 --> 02:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
on a car
 
02:30:32.570 --> 02:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
our inspection on a car I should say
 
02:30:35.410 --> 02:30:35.420 align:start position:0%
they do change yearly they have the the
 
02:30:39.170 --> 02:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
license number of the lobstermen the the
 
02:30:42.050 --> 02:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
number of traps that they they only get
 
02:30:44.270 --> 02:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
so many plus ten percent
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
um the only issue is that that those
 
02:30:48.170 --> 02:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
trap tags are do not come from fish and
 
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
game they come from an outside vendor
 
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
there are times when those outside
 
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
vendors have issues I know the vendor is
 
02:30:58.010 --> 02:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
has had issues in years past where they
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
were unable to get those trap tags those
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
new trap tags for for months to some of
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
those because so they are allowed to
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
continue fishing with the older tag
 
02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
until exactly with a waiver from Fish
 
02:31:10.969 --> 02:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
and Game
 
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
but if it's
 
02:31:16.570 --> 02:31:16.580 align:start position:0%
blue and you didn't have blue since
 
02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:18.290 align:start position:0%
blue and you didn't have blue since
2020

02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
2020
 
02:31:22.130 --> 02:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
that's obviously a derelict trap if
 
02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
you've got one down there with you know
 
02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
a color that's two three four five years
 
02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:26.690 align:start position:0%
a color that's two three four five years
old

02:31:26.690 --> 02:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
old
 
02:31:29.210 --> 02:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
that one is obviously not one that's
 
02:31:32.210 --> 02:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
currently being fished outside of the
 
02:31:34.429 --> 02:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
the color it would have the year of the
 
02:31:34.439 --> 02:31:36.050 align:start position:0%
the color it would have the year of the
okay

02:31:36.050 --> 02:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
oh yeah there's the picture there
 
02:31:38.399 --> 02:31:42.889 align:start position:0%
oh yeah there's the picture there
yeah

02:31:42.889 --> 02:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.730 --> 02:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
yep with the owner and the owner's
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
telephone number and
 
02:31:59.929 --> 02:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
and the color that looks like the uh
 
02:32:01.849 --> 02:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
name tag that needs to be on the Trap
 
02:32:04.070 --> 02:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
the Trap tag is actually a uh that's
 
02:32:08.090 --> 02:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
like a zip tie that clicks together that
 
02:32:10.910 --> 02:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
looks like the name that's the name is
 
02:32:12.410 --> 02:32:12.420 align:start position:0%
required to have a name on the Trap and
 
02:32:15.530 --> 02:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
on the buoy in this state
 
02:32:19.849 --> 02:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.429 --> 02:32:22.439 align:start position:0%
I'm going to propose that we take the
 
02:32:24.650 --> 02:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
language that you came up with
 
02:32:28.090 --> 02:32:28.100 align:start position:0%
and we make an amendment from this body
 
02:32:31.010 --> 02:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
so that we can start the action with
 
02:32:33.650 --> 02:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
that report coming back given the
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
understanding that we might need to file
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
legislation in September November time
 
02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
frame to to allow Fish and Game to do
 
02:32:41.450 --> 02:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
what they're going to come up with for
 
02:32:43.010 --> 02:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
an idea
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
and um knowing that we've directed the
 
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
information to go back to fish and game
 
02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
about how we plan to proceed I'm happy
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
to take the lead on drafting the
 
02:32:55.730 --> 02:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
amendment I would appreciate that very
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
much and you can add me as a co-sponsor
 
02:33:00.290 --> 02:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
on that one uh with you so essentially
 
02:33:03.230 --> 02:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
how this the you're agreeing to a seed
 
02:33:05.330 --> 02:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
to the Senate position with the amended
 
02:33:07.250 --> 02:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
language that is what I'm going to
 
02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
suggest and I'm going to have to take a
 
02:33:11.450 --> 02:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
feeling from the body here do you want a
 
02:33:14.210 --> 02:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
quick caucus with them
 
02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
um do you think we need one or you uh
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
all right we might as well okay well
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
recess now for another five take it
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
you're taking a break we're going to
 
02:33:26.330 --> 02:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
take a break for five minutes and we'll
 
02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
in my office
 
02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:38.270 align:start position:0%
in my office
yes

02:33:38.270 --> 02:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:38.280 --> 02:41:10.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:41:10.849 --> 02:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
the patients we are back
 
02:41:18.650 --> 02:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
and I think we are ready to accede to
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate's position with the amendment
 
02:41:24.110 --> 02:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
being drafted
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge that sadly we aren't
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
going to be able to save the animals
 
02:41:30.830 --> 02:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
that are trapped during the summer this
 
02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:31.790 align:start position:0%
that are trapped during the summer this
year

02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
um it strikes me as ironic that we can
 
02:41:35.929 --> 02:41:35.939 align:start position:0%
break a window of a car to let a dog out
 
02:41:38.450 --> 02:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
when it's dying but that trap washed up
 
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
on the beach you can't let the lobster
 
02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
out not saying steal it and put it in my
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
car but even somebody would be
 
02:41:46.910 --> 02:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited from letting the lobster out
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
and putting it back in the water rather
 
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
they'd have to slowly watch it bake to
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
death in the Sun
 
02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
until somebody came along to deal with
 
02:41:56.690 --> 02:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
it that owned the Trap it's kind of a
 
02:41:58.190 --> 02:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
situation that we need to come to a
 
02:42:00.889 --> 02:42:00.899 align:start position:0%
better grip on in the future but at this
 
02:42:03.050 --> 02:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
point it's obvious that um
 
02:42:05.090 --> 02:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done and if we
 
02:42:06.650 --> 02:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
don't accede to the Senate's position
 
02:42:09.410 --> 02:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
with this amendment uh demanding action
 
02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
from the fish and game department
 
02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:15.490 align:start position:0%
with a plan by September 30th that
 
02:42:15.490 --> 02:42:16.010 align:start position:0%
with a plan by September 30th that
[Music]

02:42:16.010 --> 02:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:17.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
we aren't going to get anything done
 
02:42:20.809 --> 02:42:20.819 align:start position:0%
because it'll just die and we'll get no
 
02:42:22.010 --> 02:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
steps forward
 
02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:23.510 align:start position:0%
steps forward
so

02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:27.290 --> 02:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
um with that I will uh move that we
 
02:42:30.349 --> 02:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
accede to the Senate's position
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
and um with the amendment being drafted
 
02:42:35.389 --> 02:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
and and we'll give you the lead on that
 
02:42:37.849 --> 02:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
drafting Senator Pearl we'll take care
 
02:42:41.210 --> 02:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
of that and I'm going to ask for uh a
 
02:42:44.090 --> 02:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
vote of my my committee here
 
02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:46.910 align:start position:0%
vote of my my committee here
um

02:42:46.910 --> 02:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
I'll ask you uh each and turn my in turn
 
02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:54.130 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:42:54.130 --> 02:42:54.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:42:58.429 --> 02:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
I'll reluctantly see the amended Senate
 
02:43:01.610 --> 02:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
sadly also as I stated earlier in the
 
02:43:04.130 --> 02:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
question I asked earlier I just still do
 
02:43:06.770 --> 02:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
not comprehend the current law any
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
inability as you said well put that
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
these animals will just have to die
 
02:43:13.309 --> 02:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
whether they're underwater with a
 
02:43:15.530 --> 02:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
detached rope or balled up on the beach
 
02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
baking in the sun makes no sense to me
 
02:43:21.469 --> 02:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
but I also agree with you that uh it
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
seems like we have a solid impasse so to
 
02:43:25.849 --> 02:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
try to get something done before the
 
02:43:28.429 --> 02:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
filing period for next year I will join
 
02:43:28.439 --> 02:43:29.150 align:start position:0%
filing period for next year I will join
you

02:43:29.150 --> 02:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:43:32.210 --> 02:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you all right representative Hill
 
02:43:35.210 --> 02:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
like to see the headlines
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
and you will accede Iola seed
 
02:43:41.210 --> 02:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
and representative pair
 
02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's the best we can do that's the
 
02:43:45.530 --> 02:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
best we can do I will see
 
02:43:47.630 --> 02:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:49.370 --> 02:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
um we will get the amendment drafted and
 
02:43:51.950 --> 02:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
then it will be prepared for sign off uh
 
02:43:54.410 --> 02:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
in the clerk's office and we're going to
 
02:43:57.230 --> 02:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
need a blurb from our side
 
02:43:57.240 --> 02:43:59.090 align:start position:0%
need a blurb from our side
okay

02:43:59.090 --> 02:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you all
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.930 --> 05:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
hey everybody good afternoon it is two
 
05:02:16.730 --> 05:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
o'clock we're gonna open up the
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
committee of conference hearing on HB 75
 
05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
as currently amended by
 
05:02:26.570 --> 05:02:26.580 align:start position:0%
1552 relative to the election of
 
05:02:29.930 --> 05:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
Stratford County Commissioners
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
like to open up the floor to any
 
05:02:33.470 --> 05:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
comments let's start with Senator gray
 
05:02:33.480 --> 05:02:35.868 align:start position:0%
comments let's start with Senator gray
since

05:02:35.868 --> 05:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:02:38.690 --> 05:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm the one who did the amendment that
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh uh originally just for background we
 
05:02:46.490 --> 05:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
got three bills from the house uh I was
 
05:02:48.530 --> 05:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
very concerned that I wasn't going to
 
05:02:50.930 --> 05:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
get a budget from the house so I
 
05:02:53.810 --> 05:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
Consolidated those three bills into one
 
05:02:57.770 --> 05:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
bill which left 75 and I think it was 87
 
05:03:01.128 --> 05:03:01.138 align:start position:0%
if I'm correct Senator Susie
 
05:03:03.430 --> 05:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
um that uh
 
05:03:06.110 --> 05:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
you know would be disposed of if we
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
didn't need them for the budget I was
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
asked by a constituent because the there
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
is a bill that originated in the house
 
05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
um to start using districts in Stratford
 
05:03:22.610 --> 05:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
County which would make it consistent
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
with the other nine counties to do that
 
05:03:29.930 --> 05:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh so I took the bill that was in the
 
05:03:33.170 --> 05:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
house uh put it on an amendment had a
 
05:03:37.730 --> 05:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
public hearing on it uh and that's how
 
05:03:42.230 --> 05:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
we are here today during that process uh
 
05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
I did several different uh
 
05:03:48.650 --> 05:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
Arrangements based on comments that I
 
05:03:52.430 --> 05:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
heard made them available to various
 
05:03:54.350 --> 05:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
people in the county including the
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
County Administrator who's the one who
 
05:03:59.868 --> 05:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
talked to me most about this
 
05:04:04.610 --> 05:04:04.620 align:start position:0%
um including a map that uh had
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
the County Commissioners in separate
 
05:04:10.850 --> 05:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
districts from where they live right now
 
05:04:15.050 --> 05:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
um the map that was originally in the
 
05:04:18.368 --> 05:04:18.378 align:start position:0%
House Bill had two of the Commissioners
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
in the same district because the awards
 
05:04:24.410 --> 05:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
that they lived in the ward in Dover
 
05:04:29.868 --> 05:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
so again I looked at it for the
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
constituents told them if they could get
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
some support that I would change the
 
05:04:42.170 --> 05:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
layout that was on the map that I was
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
presenting uh at the hearing
 
05:04:49.550 --> 05:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and even afterward uh I got no
 
05:04:52.550 --> 05:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
response back from that so I went with
 
05:04:55.330 --> 05:04:55.340 align:start position:0%
the map that was in the house bill
 
05:04:59.330 --> 05:04:59.340 align:start position:0%
and that's what has been passed
 
05:05:02.530 --> 05:05:02.540 align:start position:0%
again from comments that I've received
 
05:05:07.128 --> 05:05:07.138 align:start position:0%
via one of the lobbyists uh I again went
 
05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
and did the map
 
05:05:11.810 --> 05:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
that would put the County Commissioners
 
05:05:14.410 --> 05:05:14.420 align:start position:0%
in separate districts
 
05:05:16.610 --> 05:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
it has
 
05:05:21.050 --> 05:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
a couple of detractors it has us down to
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
one point where the uh
 
05:05:28.250 --> 05:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
Warden Dover I think it is in whichever
 
05:05:31.490 --> 05:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
Town it is butting up against each other
 
05:05:34.270 --> 05:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
in just one point but that is still
 
05:05:38.890 --> 05:05:38.900 align:start position:0%
legal but it has a very good deviation
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
of 5.5 percent from the highest positive
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
to the highest negative which is a good
 
05:05:49.128 --> 05:05:49.138 align:start position:0%
deviation when you're looking at making
 
05:05:52.250 --> 05:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
the populations equal especially in the
 
05:05:55.368 --> 05:05:55.378 align:start position:0%
maps that I've done so that's where we
 
05:05:57.410 --> 05:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
are today right now the thing in front
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
of us is the
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill as the house did it we passed that
 
05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the Senate it went back to you I am
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
certainly willing if uh one of the
 
05:06:14.090 --> 05:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
Democrats uh on the Committees would
 
05:06:16.850 --> 05:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
like to present uh the other map that
 
05:06:18.170 --> 05:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
I've done
 
05:06:19.788 --> 05:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
um certainly willing to have that
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
presented uh copies are available for
 
05:06:25.310 --> 05:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
all of the people here on the committee
 
05:06:25.320 --> 05:06:27.110 align:start position:0%
all of the people here on the committee
conference

05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
conference
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll continue with the
 
05:06:31.730 --> 05:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
discussions very good Center and just
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
for the clarification of everybody at
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
the table Senator gray is talking about
 
05:06:41.090 --> 05:06:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment 2023 2211 s
 
05:06:43.810 --> 05:06:43.820 align:start position:0%
that is not what is currently
 
05:06:46.810 --> 05:06:46.820 align:start position:0%
up for discussion but as Senator gray
 
05:06:49.670 --> 05:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned if there's somebody a Democrat
 
05:06:51.590 --> 05:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
who would like to put forward that
 
05:07:00.010 --> 05:07:00.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.810 --> 05:07:02.820 align:start position:0%
and I am not hearing that is there any
 
05:07:05.030 --> 05:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
05:07:07.430 --> 05:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
I will say that when
 
05:07:09.530 --> 05:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray's Amendment that's on the
 
05:07:15.530 --> 05:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
table right now came to the house it
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
went through what I can only describe as
 
05:07:20.448 --> 05:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
a some schizophrenic voting uh the
 
05:07:23.690 --> 05:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
original motion to approve or to concur
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
with the Senate failed by two or three
 
05:07:29.868 --> 05:07:29.878 align:start position:0%
votes uh the sub subsequent votes
 
05:07:33.110 --> 05:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
actually prevailed by three votes that's
 
05:07:35.208 --> 05:07:35.218 align:start position:0%
how we ended up here
 
05:07:41.150 --> 05:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:44.930 --> 05:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I appreciate the work
 
05:07:47.390 --> 05:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
that Senator gray has done in being open
 
05:07:51.050 --> 05:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
to to looking at these districts I still
 
05:07:54.830 --> 05:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
find myself wondering why having been a
 
05:07:57.410 --> 05:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
member of the redistricting process and
 
05:07:59.570 --> 05:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
having gone to the hearing in Stratford
 
05:07:59.580 --> 05:08:01.010 align:start position:0%
having gone to the hearing in Stratford
County

05:08:01.010 --> 05:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
County
 
05:08:01.020 --> 05:08:02.628 align:start position:0%
County
where

05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:08:04.550 --> 05:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
Not only was there no mention of the
 
05:08:06.170 --> 05:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner districts
 
05:08:08.628 --> 05:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
but the complaints about the house
 
05:08:08.638 --> 05:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
but the complaints about the house
district

05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
district
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
s are things that are being done in both
 
05:08:16.570 --> 05:08:16.580 align:start position:0%
versions of these Maps which is
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
land areas that are barely contiguous
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
and splitting up the cities and I think
 
05:08:26.090 --> 05:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
the fact that the cities are being split
 
05:08:29.810 --> 05:08:29.820 align:start position:0%
up is part of the reason why the
 
05:08:32.930 --> 05:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
delegation as a whole regardless of the
 
05:08:35.530 --> 05:08:35.540 align:start position:0%
makeup hasn't brought this forward
 
05:08:37.970 --> 05:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
geographically Stratford is one of the
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
smallest counties there's always a
 
05:08:44.090 --> 05:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
contention between cities and towns
 
05:08:46.010 --> 05:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
um you know I happen to live in
 
05:08:48.350 --> 05:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester Manchester and Bedford are
 
05:08:50.270 --> 05:08:50.280 align:start position:0%
part of one commissioner District but
 
05:08:52.128 --> 05:08:52.138 align:start position:0%
that was a plan that Hillsborough County
 
05:08:54.650 --> 05:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
brought forward and I still remain
 
05:08:58.730 --> 05:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
concerned that this is
 
05:09:00.410 --> 05:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
in my view and I'm just going to say
 
05:09:02.930 --> 05:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
this this is a partisan move to change
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
these districts and the fact that we
 
05:09:07.610 --> 05:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
were asked if a Democrat wanted to bring
 
05:09:09.650 --> 05:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
one map forward or it should be a
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
Committee Member and I I guess I still
 
05:09:14.510 --> 05:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
struggle with the process that brings us
 
05:09:18.170 --> 05:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
here and I know that regardless of what
 
05:09:20.810 --> 05:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
we do today in January your bill
 
05:09:22.730 --> 05:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
representative will still have to have a
 
05:09:25.368 --> 05:09:25.378 align:start position:0%
vote before the body and your bill
 
05:09:27.470 --> 05:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
attempts to do something similar in
 
05:09:29.690 --> 05:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
redistricting the county so I I'm just
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
not prepared today to
 
05:09:32.280 --> 05:09:33.650 align:start position:0%
not prepared today to
um

05:09:33.650 --> 05:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:36.770 --> 05:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
to vote affirmatively on either versions
 
05:09:39.170 --> 05:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
of the maps at this time
 
05:09:42.650 --> 05:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for that representative stavis
 
05:09:45.288 --> 05:09:45.298 align:start position:0%
thank you representative turcotte and um
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
I have a couple of concerns which is the
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
reason I did not offer to move this
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
amendment forward and one primarily is
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
the process concern in Municipal and
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
County government of which I am the
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
ranking member we make changes to how
 
05:10:05.090 --> 05:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
counties do their business all the time
 
05:10:07.250 --> 05:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's our routine
 
05:10:07.260 --> 05:10:08.690 align:start position:0%
it's our routine
MO

05:10:08.690 --> 05:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
MO
 
05:10:12.410 --> 05:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
in our committee but we do we don't do
 
05:10:14.208 --> 05:10:14.218 align:start position:0%
changes like this one
 
05:10:17.810 --> 05:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
we um usually hear from multiple
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives who have been approached
 
05:10:19.680 --> 05:10:20.690 align:start position:0%
Representatives who have been approached
by

05:10:20.690 --> 05:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:10:24.530 --> 05:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 constituents from both sides of
 
05:10:27.050 --> 05:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
the aisle all sides of the aisle who
 
05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
want to have Commissioners elected at
 
05:10:31.010 --> 05:10:31.020 align:start position:0%
large they want them elected by District
 
05:10:33.310 --> 05:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
they want this they want that
 
05:10:36.770 --> 05:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
and we then have a hearing and we hear
 
05:10:41.150 --> 05:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
from all sides we didn't have that with
 
05:10:43.850 --> 05:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
HB 270 and that is why we voted to
 
05:10:46.730 --> 05:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
retain it in the house so I'm still kind
 
05:10:49.550 --> 05:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
of stuck on thinking about House Bill
 
05:10:52.430 --> 05:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
270 and the fact that it was retained
 
05:10:56.090 --> 05:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden appeared almost
 
05:10:59.270 --> 05:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
exactly in identical format in a Senate
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
bill I would like our committee to
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
continue to work on this bill to
 
05:11:06.530 --> 05:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
continue to consult with all
 
05:11:10.128 --> 05:11:10.138 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this issue and arrive at
 
05:11:12.770 --> 05:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
a well-informed decision
 
05:11:18.910 --> 05:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:21.288 --> 05:11:21.298 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray
 
05:11:21.298 --> 05:11:22.128 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray
um

05:11:22.128 --> 05:11:22.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:23.930 --> 05:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
trying to respond to some of the things
 
05:11:25.550 --> 05:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
out there um
 
05:11:28.490 --> 05:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 270 did get a hearing in
 
05:11:29.708 --> 05:11:29.718 align:start position:0%
the house
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 75 and the amendment from 270
 
05:11:37.310 --> 05:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
did get a hearing in the Senate it
 
05:11:39.708 --> 05:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
followed the normal standard procedures
 
05:11:43.730 --> 05:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
that that we have you know in
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
um the continued uh you know making the
 
05:11:47.040 --> 05:11:49.128 align:start position:0%
um the continued uh you know making the
uh

05:11:49.128 --> 05:11:49.138 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:11:52.610 --> 05:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
map up or certainly uh there is
 
05:11:55.128 --> 05:11:55.138 align:start position:0%
conflicting things whether I'm going you
 
05:11:57.050 --> 05:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
know how how much of a border I have to
 
05:12:00.410 --> 05:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
share between one town and another uh
 
05:12:03.410 --> 05:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
and equal population uh certainly when
 
05:12:05.868 --> 05:12:05.878 align:start position:0%
we look at County Commissioners in the
 
05:12:08.510 --> 05:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
State Constitution and other
 
05:12:10.730 --> 05:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
documentation there is no real
 
05:12:12.670 --> 05:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines about anything
 
05:12:16.730 --> 05:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh nine of the counties
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
um do it by electing people by District
 
05:12:25.250 --> 05:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
okay let me clarify that okay two of
 
05:12:26.930 --> 05:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
them you have to live in the district
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
but they vote County Wide for the
 
05:12:33.650 --> 05:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
positions and the others they all have
 
05:12:36.770 --> 05:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
to live and are voted on by the people
 
05:12:39.530 --> 05:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
in that District Stratford county is the
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
only one that didn't
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
I have lived in Stratford County or it's
 
05:12:46.430 --> 05:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
been my residence because the time I was
 
05:12:49.910 --> 05:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the service and and the uh I have
 
05:12:53.090 --> 05:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
kept my my residence in New Hampshire uh
 
05:12:56.930 --> 05:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
since 1964. okay I have never known
 
05:12:59.690 --> 05:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
anything other than County Commissioners
 
05:13:03.470 --> 05:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
being elected you know by countywide
 
05:13:07.128 --> 05:13:07.138 align:start position:0%
okay so you know if you want to say
 
05:13:09.770 --> 05:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
something why I didn't bring it up well
 
05:13:12.050 --> 05:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
I've never known anything different I've
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
never really investigated the different
 
05:13:15.890 --> 05:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
counties okay
 
05:13:17.868 --> 05:13:17.878 align:start position:0%
but nine of them
 
05:13:21.128 --> 05:13:21.138 align:start position:0%
are same one is different okay
 
05:13:24.770 --> 05:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
constituents came to me said hey this
 
05:13:27.110 --> 05:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
thing is stalled we'd like to move it
 
05:13:29.868 --> 05:13:29.878 align:start position:0%
along we think it's stalled because of
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
the close separation between the
 
05:13:34.670 --> 05:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
Democrats and the Republicans and the
 
05:13:37.250 --> 05:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
house committee okay
 
05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
I'm responding to my constituents health
 
05:13:43.670 --> 05:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
and public hearing did the work and
 
05:13:46.430 --> 05:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
passed the bill
 
05:13:49.550 --> 05:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
if it is not to their liking
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
remember we had I think it was one or
 
05:13:56.090 --> 05:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
two opposed and three or four four in
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
the in the senate committee and it was
 
05:14:02.448 --> 05:14:02.458 align:start position:0%
publicized beforehand in fact I made
 
05:14:05.628 --> 05:14:05.638 align:start position:0%
sure that the the rankings Democrat on
 
05:14:07.850 --> 05:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
the senate election law committee knew
 
05:14:09.110 --> 05:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
about it
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
um I think it was a week to week and a
 
05:14:12.650 --> 05:14:12.660 align:start position:0%
half you know before
 
05:14:15.050 --> 05:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
and it was actually the same day the
 
05:14:17.690 --> 05:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
constituent had contacted me you know so
 
05:14:19.730 --> 05:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
I couldn't do it any sooner
 
05:14:19.740 --> 05:14:22.430 align:start position:0%
I couldn't do it any sooner
okay

05:14:22.430 --> 05:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:26.830 --> 05:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
the constituents in the smaller towns
 
05:14:30.590 --> 05:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
want to be represented if you look at
 
05:14:32.990 --> 05:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
the things that are happening Ward 5 in
 
05:14:35.448 --> 05:14:35.458 align:start position:0%
Rochester and when we did the state
 
05:14:37.970 --> 05:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
representative districts
 
05:14:39.890 --> 05:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
they were complaining because they were
 
05:14:42.890 --> 05:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
grouped with Middleton Milton okay
 
05:14:45.830 --> 05:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
why because they want the representation
 
05:14:49.850 --> 05:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
as close to the people as you can
 
05:14:52.190 --> 05:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
electing County Commissioners countywide
 
05:14:55.310 --> 05:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
is not getting that representation as
 
05:14:58.070 --> 05:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
close to the people as you can using
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
districts like the other nine counties
 
05:15:01.200 --> 05:15:02.448 align:start position:0%
districts like the other nine counties
do

05:15:02.448 --> 05:15:02.458 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:15:04.970 --> 05:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
this is how you do that
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
and to say we ought to wait
 
05:15:08.400 --> 05:15:09.708 align:start position:0%
and to say we ought to wait
why

05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:15:12.650 --> 05:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
we have a map in front of us it got a
 
05:15:14.448 --> 05:15:14.458 align:start position:0%
majority vote in the Senate
 
05:15:14.458 --> 05:15:15.770 align:start position:0%
majority vote in the Senate
it

05:15:15.770 --> 05:15:15.780 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:15:17.690 --> 05:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
didn't get a
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
majority vote one way or the other in
 
05:15:21.890 --> 05:15:21.900 align:start position:0%
the house
 
05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
there are also people that say well hey
 
05:15:27.170 --> 05:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
you had your shot at redistricting
 
05:15:29.330 --> 05:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
this is a separate Grace
 
05:15:31.730 --> 05:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
we have not redistricted we have not
 
05:15:33.650 --> 05:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
districteded we have not done anything
 
05:15:35.868 --> 05:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
with Stratford County
 
05:15:37.970 --> 05:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
and if we look back to the Supreme Court
 
05:15:43.330 --> 05:15:43.340 align:start position:0%
decisions about when the Supreme Court
 
05:15:47.090 --> 05:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
did the districting 10 11 years ago
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
whatever it is now they said okay
 
05:15:54.170 --> 05:15:54.180 align:start position:0%
this the house and the Senate have not
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
weighed in and have not redistricted so
 
05:16:02.270 --> 05:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:04.550 --> 05:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
because we still have our opportunity
 
05:16:07.550 --> 05:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
once in the 10 years
 
05:16:09.410 --> 05:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's one legal argument the other
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
legal argument is this is districting
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
not redistricting
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
05:16:19.970 --> 05:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
I you know I'm I'm happy with the the
 
05:16:23.570 --> 05:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
map in 270 that we put into the bill
 
05:16:27.770 --> 05:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh but if you know to make its thing
 
05:16:30.350 --> 05:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
more partisan if I can get somebody else
 
05:16:33.170 --> 05:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
that has a different map
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the only one I know is out there is
 
05:16:38.448 --> 05:16:38.458 align:start position:0%
the one that I drew you know at the
 
05:16:41.090 --> 05:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
request of the administrator of
 
05:16:43.490 --> 05:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
Stratford County that says can I draw a
 
05:16:46.970 --> 05:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
map that meets the criteria
 
05:16:49.610 --> 05:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
and it puts the three existing County
 
05:16:52.550 --> 05:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioners in separate districts
 
05:16:56.030 --> 05:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
I went and did it and I passed it out
 
05:16:58.610 --> 05:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
if you want it support it if you don't
 
05:16:59.690 --> 05:16:59.700 align:start position:0%
want it
 
05:17:02.930 --> 05:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
then we'll take the vote on the map from
 
05:17:02.940 --> 05:17:04.310 align:start position:0%
then we'll take the vote on the map from
270.

05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
270.
 
05:17:06.410 --> 05:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:08.208 --> 05:17:08.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator uh representative
 
05:17:08.218 --> 05:17:09.650 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator uh representative
lasalles

05:17:09.650 --> 05:17:09.660 align:start position:0%
lasalles
 
05:17:12.530 --> 05:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I think when
 
05:17:14.330 --> 05:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
you look at a case like this I've heard
 
05:17:17.208 --> 05:17:17.218 align:start position:0%
arguments that and Senator gray touched
 
05:17:20.470 --> 05:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
on it when he said that why are we
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
redistricting in the middle of the
 
05:17:25.250 --> 05:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
stream we're not redistricting we're
 
05:17:28.550 --> 05:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
making the initial districts anytime you
 
05:17:30.650 --> 05:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
have a situation like this
 
05:17:30.660 --> 05:17:32.390 align:start position:0%
have a situation like this
where

05:17:32.390 --> 05:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:17:35.930 --> 05:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
all of the Commissioners are elected
 
05:17:40.730 --> 05:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
on an at-large basis the minority is
 
05:17:44.090 --> 05:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
Left Behind and if you look at
 
05:17:48.230 --> 05:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
at the history of the county you'll see
 
05:17:50.890 --> 05:17:50.900 align:start position:0%
that the minority has been left behind
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
Time After Time After Time and after a
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
while the people who are in the minority
 
05:18:01.270 --> 05:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
figure out that they've been
 
05:18:06.050 --> 05:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised and nobody cares whether
 
05:18:08.810 --> 05:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
they've been disenfranchised so they
 
05:18:12.650 --> 05:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
lose faith in the political system I've
 
05:18:15.410 --> 05:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
heard people say that this is too
 
05:18:18.890 --> 05:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
political of course it's political it's
 
05:18:21.970 --> 05:18:21.980 align:start position:0%
inherently political it's political
 
05:18:27.470 --> 05:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
subdivisions so I I think overall the
 
05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
map that that is attached to to
 
05:18:38.570 --> 05:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh works for me and I
 
05:18:40.970 --> 05:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
know that anytime you have situations
 
05:18:44.570 --> 05:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
like this there are negative aspects but
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
I think this is a much better the people
 
05:18:52.730 --> 05:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
particularly in the rural areas of the
 
05:18:56.270 --> 05:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
county are much better represented than
 
05:18:59.570 --> 05:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
they have been in the past
 
05:19:01.010 --> 05:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:19:02.570 --> 05:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:19:04.970 --> 05:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative save us thank you Mr
 
05:19:04.980 --> 05:19:05.690 align:start position:0%
representative save us thank you Mr
chair

05:19:05.690 --> 05:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
chair
 
05:19:08.030 --> 05:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
so I I keep hearing a couple of
 
05:19:10.550 --> 05:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
different things so I'm hoping someone
 
05:19:11.990 --> 05:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
can educate me
 
05:19:14.750 --> 05:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing that people have lost faith
 
05:19:17.690 --> 05:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
in the political process and so they
 
05:19:20.208 --> 05:19:20.218 align:start position:0%
didn't bother to do anything and to
 
05:19:22.850 --> 05:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
change the situation I've also heard
 
05:19:25.970 --> 05:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
that for years and years and years this
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
has been the case and this process has
 
05:19:30.890 --> 05:19:30.900 align:start position:0%
been and I'm using someone else's words
 
05:19:32.448 --> 05:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
here stalled
 
05:19:35.930 --> 05:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking at HB 54 which has been
 
05:19:37.970 --> 05:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
enacted it was enacted in November of
 
05:19:40.850 --> 05:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
2021 so not years and years and years
 
05:19:44.208 --> 05:19:44.218 align:start position:0%
ago but just barely two years ago
 
05:19:47.810 --> 05:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
and that was a redistricting bill
 
05:19:50.208 --> 05:19:50.218 align:start position:0%
that was presumably worked on by the
 
05:19:51.890 --> 05:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
and it said nothing about Stratford
 
05:19:57.288 --> 05:19:57.298 align:start position:0%
County it made no changes at all so if
 
05:19:59.330 --> 05:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
this has been going on for years and
 
05:20:01.330 --> 05:20:01.340 align:start position:0%
years and years and people have felt
 
05:20:03.650 --> 05:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised why wasn't it not
 
05:20:06.550 --> 05:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the comments seeing no
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
more I will make several comments I'll
 
05:20:15.288 --> 05:20:15.298 align:start position:0%
start by addressing the issue on HP 54.
 
05:20:17.810 --> 05:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
I was a member of the special committee
 
05:20:20.270 --> 05:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
on redistricting in the house and one of
 
05:20:20.280 --> 05:20:22.670 align:start position:0%
on redistricting in the house and one of
our

05:20:22.670 --> 05:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:25.430 --> 05:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
given duties was to redistrict the
 
05:20:28.070 --> 05:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner's Maps
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
it was brought to the attention of the
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
 
05:20:33.600 --> 05:20:35.270 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
that

05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:38.270 --> 05:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
from myself that it was the time that we
 
05:20:39.788 --> 05:20:39.798 align:start position:0%
should redistrict
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners just or
 
05:20:46.730 --> 05:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
District the in Stratford County for the
 
05:20:46.740 --> 05:20:48.350 align:start position:0%
District the in Stratford County for the
commissioners

05:20:48.350 --> 05:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
I was told by
 
05:20:54.530 --> 05:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
individuals on that committee that they
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
did not want to infuse an extra
 
05:20:59.520 --> 05:21:02.448 align:start position:0%
did not want to infuse an extra
uh

05:21:02.448 --> 05:21:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:04.610 --> 05:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
something that would muddy the waters
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
during the commissioner's redistricting
 
05:21:10.850 --> 05:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
that's why it wasn't done I've made that
 
05:21:14.030 --> 05:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
comment dozens of times now I've made it
 
05:21:16.250 --> 05:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
on the house floor I've made that
 
05:21:19.730 --> 05:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
comment in several newspapers that's the
 
05:21:21.890 --> 05:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
reason why it wasn't done for no other
 
05:21:24.230 --> 05:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
reason I brought it to the attention the
 
05:21:26.208 --> 05:21:26.218 align:start position:0%
committee the committee as a whole said
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's too much we've got too much to do
 
05:21:31.730 --> 05:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
our data's almost six to eight months
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
behind we don't have time we're not
 
05:21:35.930 --> 05:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
going to put that into the mix that's
 
05:21:39.288 --> 05:21:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:41.750 --> 05:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
um I Heard a comment about combining
 
05:21:46.250 --> 05:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
Wards with towns you cannot
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
District Stratford County
 
05:21:53.448 --> 05:21:53.458 align:start position:0%
with all cities intact it's impossible
 
05:21:56.448 --> 05:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
because of the deviation requirements it
 
05:21:57.948 --> 05:21:57.958 align:start position:0%
cannot be done
 
05:22:00.650 --> 05:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
you will require
 
05:22:04.250 --> 05:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
Ward to be combined with the town and
 
05:22:05.990 --> 05:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's not unusual in the commissioner
 
05:22:06.000 --> 05:22:06.948 align:start position:0%
that's not unusual in the commissioner
Maps

05:22:06.948 --> 05:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
Maps
 
05:22:08.770 --> 05:22:08.780 align:start position:0%
that happens throughout the state
 
05:22:10.850 --> 05:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
especially when you cut when you're
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
talking about the state representative
 
05:22:16.250 --> 05:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
Maps you go through those I'm very very
 
05:22:17.868 --> 05:22:17.878 align:start position:0%
very familiar with you go through and
 
05:22:19.850 --> 05:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
you'll find in almost every County or at
 
05:22:21.350 --> 05:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
least half the counties you will see
 
05:22:25.430 --> 05:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
where Wards are combined with towns for
 
05:22:29.650 --> 05:22:29.660 align:start position:0%
the specific reason you have to meet
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
deviation requirements which are have
 
05:22:36.230 --> 05:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
been for the most part a 10 deviation in
 
05:22:39.890 --> 05:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
all the U.S Supreme Court cases
 
05:22:39.900 --> 05:22:43.628 align:start position:0%
all the U.S Supreme Court cases
um

05:22:43.628 --> 05:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:47.208 --> 05:22:47.218 align:start position:0%
why are we doing this now why was it
 
05:22:47.218 --> 05:22:48.708 align:start position:0%
why are we doing this now why was it
retained

05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
retained
 
05:22:50.990 --> 05:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
I got a laugh on the house floor last
 
05:22:53.330 --> 05:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
week when I said it was retained by a
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
mistaken vote and that is a fact a
 
05:22:58.788 --> 05:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
member of our committee made the wrong
 
05:22:58.798 --> 05:22:59.810 align:start position:0%
member of our committee made the wrong
vote

05:22:59.810 --> 05:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:23:02.030 --> 05:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
after several other votes
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
05:23:05.570 --> 05:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
and that's where it is and it's stuck
 
05:23:08.150 --> 05:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
and we can't get it out of there that is
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
why Senator gray took up and put the
 
05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
contents of HB 270
 
05:23:21.530 --> 05:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:23.628 --> 05:23:23.638 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
as Senator gray mentioned there are
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
different ways that Commissioners get
 
05:23:30.650 --> 05:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
elected in our state
 
05:23:33.410 --> 05:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
in each of the nine each of the ten
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
counties as he said and I'll reiterate
 
05:23:38.330 --> 05:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
nine of the counties have districts
 
05:23:40.970 --> 05:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
Stratford county is the only one
 
05:23:45.910 --> 05:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:49.788 --> 05:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
this map would bring us if you want to
 
05:23:53.330 --> 05:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
look for a analogy we would mirror how
 
05:23:55.010 --> 05:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County elects their
 
05:23:55.020 --> 05:23:56.628 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County elects their
commissioners

05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:03.708 --> 05:24:03.718 align:start position:0%
during our as a member of the special
 
05:24:06.770 --> 05:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
committee on redistricting we went
 
05:24:08.990 --> 05:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
around to every County I think I made
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
seven of the ten and to hear input on
 
05:24:14.570 --> 05:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
the three maps that we were responsible
 
05:24:17.690 --> 05:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
State reps the U.S house rep
 
05:24:22.368 --> 05:24:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:25.368 --> 05:24:25.378 align:start position:0%
we probably heard from him let's call it
 
05:24:29.930 --> 05:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:31.788 --> 05:24:31.798 align:start position:0%
do you know how many individuals spoke
 
05:24:34.610 --> 05:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
up about a commissioner's map
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
not a single one
 
05:24:41.750 --> 05:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:45.948 --> 05:24:45.958 align:start position:0%
last thing I will say is by default I
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
hear the word those very unfamiliar with
 
05:24:50.510 --> 05:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
redistricting in the process and
 
05:24:51.530 --> 05:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
everything that goes into the
 
05:24:53.390 --> 05:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
redistricting process
 
05:24:55.610 --> 05:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
they like to look at a map and Oh that's
 
05:24:57.410 --> 05:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered oh the process is
 
05:24:57.420 --> 05:24:59.090 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered oh the process is
gerrymandered

05:24:59.090 --> 05:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered
 
05:25:01.128 --> 05:25:01.138 align:start position:0%
most people who talk about Jeremy don't
 
05:25:03.770 --> 05:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
have a clue what actual gerrymandering
 
05:25:03.780 --> 05:25:06.830 align:start position:0%
have a clue what actual gerrymandering
is

05:25:06.830 --> 05:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:09.530 --> 05:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
I think I could make a very very strong
 
05:25:09.540 --> 05:25:10.930 align:start position:0%
I think I could make a very very strong
argument

05:25:10.930 --> 05:25:10.940 align:start position:0%
argument
 
05:25:14.570 --> 05:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
that right now as Strafford County has
 
05:25:16.970 --> 05:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
been for the last 40 years
 
05:25:20.270 --> 05:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
is gerrymandered by by default just by
 
05:25:25.850 --> 05:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.288 --> 05:25:27.298 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
05:25:29.270 --> 05:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
um once again I'll open it up if anybody
 
05:25:32.448 --> 05:25:32.458 align:start position:0%
wishes to make an amendment or introduce
 
05:25:34.670 --> 05:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment I'll accept that if we
 
05:25:37.730 --> 05:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
don't we'll proceed on from here
 
05:25:41.390 --> 05:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
and not seeing anybody so
 
05:25:43.490 --> 05:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
um I understand we got to take a house
 
05:25:47.030 --> 05:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:57.230 --> 05:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.628 --> 05:25:59.638 align:start position:0%
thanks Senator all those in favor of the
 
05:25:59.638 --> 05:26:01.070 align:start position:0%
thanks Senator all those in favor of the
house

05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
members of the House who are in favor of
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
the existing HP 75 as amended by 1552
 
05:26:08.930 --> 05:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
say aye aye
 
05:26:12.530 --> 05:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
all those opposed say no or thank you
 
05:26:15.708 --> 05:26:15.718 align:start position:0%
that is three to one so uh with that we
 
05:26:18.050 --> 05:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
will close the committee a conference on
 
05:26:22.270 --> 05:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
each the 75 as amended by 1552
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll have the committee Court
 
05:26:38.208 --> 05:26:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:38.218 --> 05:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
 
foreign
