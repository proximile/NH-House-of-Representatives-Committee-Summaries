77% of our fair housing intakes during
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
that period the next Grant period of
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
June 2023 to May 2024 saw an increase to
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
119 mental or physical disability
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
intakes representing 87% of our fa fair
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
housing intakes that year it is true
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
today that those with disabilities face
 
00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
significant barriers in housing whether
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
it's denied accommodations or not being
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
able to access the services necessary to
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
live independently we are hopeful that
 
00:17:16.429 --> 00:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
by hearing others lived experiences and
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
the barriers that these people face this
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
committee will recommend constructive
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
policy changes to assist those who faced
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
housing challenges due to their
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities I'm welcome to share any
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
more of nh's personal experiences and
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
representing clients facing disabil
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
discrimination and welcome any questions
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
I might be able to answer okay thank you
 
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
shot oh I do um um the people who come
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
forward with disability claims of um um
 
00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
forward with disability claims of um um
again

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
um what what what what is the nature of
 
00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
those things are are they being evicted
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
did um are people are landlords not um
 
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
willing to provide
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
accommodations um are they you know are
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
they unwilling to allow um service
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
animals what kinds of um complaints are
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
you receiving from folks in the
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
disability Community yes definitely all
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
across the board and definitely what you
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
um the the ones that you just mentioned
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
um I'll say that we are unique in terms
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
of a fair housing initiales program
 
00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
because we are a legal aid organization
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
as well so we do do a lot of focus on um
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
eviction defense so often times what
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're having when it comes to
 
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:34.039 align:start position:0%
disability discrimination when it comes
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
to eviction are situations where um a
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
person is being evicted either for a
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
lease violation or for a threat to
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
health or safety where there are
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
situations caused by their disabilities
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
that are leading to things that would be
 
00:18:48.789 --> 00:18:48.799 align:start position:0%
material violations of a lease or
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
potential threats to health or safety so
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes we're seeing people who
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
might have a disability that leads to
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
hoarding um you know they that that can
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
lead to some something where you know
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
that that could lead to eviction other
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
times where there might be um either bio
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
issues or um other situations where
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
there could be a dispute between um
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
tenants but it's directly related to
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
their their disability under um there's
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
a there's a specific federal district of
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law that that protects um
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
tenants who are being evicted due to
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
these reasons that might be disability
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
related um and so we often step in to
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
essentially ask for an accommodation to
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
allow people more time and especially to
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
just get Services set up for people so
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
that they can live independently um so
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
that's one of the major areas that we
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
specifically represent in beyond that of
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
course we do absolutely step in to
 
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
assist people with accommodation
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
requests whether it's been a denial or
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
they just need help or guidance through
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
the process um we will step in to assist
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
with u making these requests for
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
accommodations or modifications and that
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
kind of wraps into as well what you were
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
talking about with service animals
 
00:19:58.029 --> 00:19:58.039 align:start position:0%
because by their definition in housing a
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
an assistance animal is an accommodation
 
00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
in of itself so we do see a fair amount
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
of those cases and and assist people
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative lontine I just
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
asked um will you be able to provide um
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
a written copy of some of your
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
testimony find that you're talking
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
really fast I apologize keep up with it
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
um um you mentioned
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
denials um how often is someone denied a
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
place to live because of a disability is
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
that is that common or is it mostly once
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
people are in apartments that they're
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
being yeah I I I think when I was saying
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
denials I was talking specifically about
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
accommodation requests denials or
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
modification request denials um so I I
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
would say you know I I wouldn't have the
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
numbers in front of me we um have
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
occasionally you know there will be
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
times where somebody has you know been
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
applying for a place and they are denied
 
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
a place because you know while they're
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
applying they ask for an accommodation
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
that does happen um I would point you
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
actually I think last week there was a
 
00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:12.279 align:start position:0%
recent HUD charge in Manchester
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
regarding a a tenant who um they had a a
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
service animal with them and when they
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
went to do a a housing um a a tour of
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
the the house um the landlord demanded
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
that they have their paperwork on them
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
at that point before they had even
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
submitted their application um and when
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
they didn't have it immediately on them
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
they said they weren't going to rent to
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
them at all um so that was a recent um
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
charge that was there that was a
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
specific denial of housing beyond that
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
it's um you know a lot of times where a
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
land a request has been made for
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
accommodation or modification the
 
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
landlord has said no and then we will
 
00:21:47.549 --> 00:21:47.559 align:start position:0%
get involved after we've received an
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
intake to see if we can try and um
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
resolve it you know and and get the
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
accommodation or modification secured um
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
when a landlord is asked to put in an
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
accommodation or
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
modification um are there
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
resources available to the landlords to
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
make that um you know for example if
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
someone needs a ramp or I mean some
 
00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:12.039 align:start position:0%
things are you know like rails in the
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
bathroom and Etc but um what kind of
 
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
resources and help are available to
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
landlords when they are asked to provide
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
an accommodation yeah um so in terms of
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
at least just taking a step back to just
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility when we're going for a
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
modific which is a change to the
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
physical structure of of um a a a
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
building um if it's a private apartment
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
It generally is going to be
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the tenant to pay um
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
to pay for those modifications is if
 
00:22:42.669 --> 00:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
it's a subsidized property then it would
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
fall on the the financial responsibility
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
of a a landlord to to provide that um
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
for tenants and landlords um out there I
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
believe that there is money through the
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
CFI program to provide it I I do
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
apologize I'm not exactly sure about you
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
know funding sources but I do know that
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
several of my clients um the money
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
actually hasn't been the problem it's
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
been you know at least some of the ones
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
that i' I've encountered it's been more
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
along the lines of um you know just a
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
person say a landlord telling them they
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
just could not install this ramp for for
 
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
example for other other reasons um so I
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
do know there's money out there but I do
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
know that it also can be a problem for
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
those who don't have money secured um C
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what CFI stands for
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence program it's a
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program um that is it that it
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
will assist people with u disabilities
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
um in providing inhome supports for them
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
both you know I believe that it can
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
assist with um actual you know physical
 
00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:42.039 align:start position:0%
change structure but it also will fund
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
um you know in in home um assist
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
assistance um so I I believe the idea
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
behind the program is that it it is it's
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
allows people to live independently stay
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
in their homes and um pay for assist pay
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
for assistance for people so that they
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
aren't um directed to assisted living
 
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%

resident at Visions for Creative Housing

00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
November oh
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
before Visions my housing was um in a
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
condo I was living by
 
00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.830 align:start position:0%
condo I was living by
myself

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
and apparently not
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
working for for me uh being
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
isolated um at Visions I have um friends
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
support I
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
don't fit
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
into um any one category of
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
disabilities um you know it's not
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
apparently obvious you know just by
 
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.950 align:start position:0%
apparently obvious you know just by
meeting

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
me um on paper I look good but and yet I
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
live visions and there there is a
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
reason is being
 
00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
alone uh was not the
 
00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
me would you um do you have more to say
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
or were you willing to take some
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
questions I'm willing to take questions
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right can can I ask you um you
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
said you felt isolated in your other
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
apartment building um and you feel more
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
um uh you feel less isolated now that
 
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
you're living so how
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
um how do you how do you interact with
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
the broader community and how does
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
Visions help you do that where you
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
weren't getting that before in your
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
condo um Visions has helped me um in
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
many ways uh one of which is
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
employment and I do work
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
full-time uh I
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
independent and you were you um when you
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
lived in your condo were you doing those
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
things also yes I was but it's a lot
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
network um and how can you describe the
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
support network how how do what kind of
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
supports do you receive
 
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
um I have the support of my fellow
 
00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
residents and the support of the direct
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
support professionals that are employed
 
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.149 align:start position:0%
support professionals that are employed
at

00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
Visions

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
okay does anyone have any other
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
questions I do okay rep
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
Senator um so through the course of our
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
committee meetings there has been
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
different schools of thought one is you
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
know that we want this what people are
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
saying in this room we don't want all
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities in
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
one space we want them to be able to
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
mingle and mix and have Independent
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
Living then I hear your story which
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like it works better for you to
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
be in a group with uh other people that
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
share the same concerns you do so I'm
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
think thinking that one of the problems
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
is we're going to have to figure
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
out an opportunity for both to
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
exist and give people the choice that
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
want to live in a community where some
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
people have disabilities and some don't
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
but then provide services and
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
communities like Visions for those who
 
00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
prefer to all be um together I am I am I
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
hearing this correct from these meetings
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so what you have works for you yes
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily what every single
 
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
person or family would like to achieve
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to find solutions
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
for both I guess is my takeaway right
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
um there
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
are I think the um the support is
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
tailored at Visions to fit the needs of
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
the individual resident and my needs are
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
U might be less than
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519 align:start position:0%
you yeah so one of the things that we
 
00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:46.070 align:start position:0%
you yeah so one of the things that we
have

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:59.629 --> 00:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
the the Restriction of creating um um
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
housing that's specifically for people
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
with disabilities is that um they don't
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
have choice
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
about what they do on a daily basis so
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
do you feel like you have choices about
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
whether to access the supports when you
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.669 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
um the residents at Visions they do have
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
um have choices
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
and if there's activity they want to do
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
then we then the um support staff tries
 
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.269 align:start position:0%
then we then the um support staff tries
to

00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:50.789 --> 00:31:50.799 align:start position:0%
accommodate each
 
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
resident and yes I have uh the unique
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
position of being able
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
to decide oh I need to I would like to
 
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
do this and I could go and do it myself
 
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
or join the rest of the
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:19.950 align:start position:0%
 
outing

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
okay okay are does anyone have any
 
00:32:22.639 --> 00:32:23.669 align:start position:0%
okay okay are does anyone have any
further

00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
um yes so you stated that you were
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
living in a condo independently and that
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't working out for you um
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
was how hard I guess was it for you to
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
find this uh solution this uh that
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
worked out for you was was there um
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
Financial barriers was there
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
time uh were you put placed on a waiting
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
list how how was that transition from
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
you know needing support to
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
achieving uh that
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
support my um moving into Visions
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
happened in the very early days of its
 
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
happened in the very early days of its
uh

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
creation um so there was no uh weight
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
list um it was sort of a decision that I
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
just had to make make and like what was
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
best for me and for for my family
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
too um it's like can you know living
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
alone can I make this work and the
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
answer was no and so the the support
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
option okay um the setting that uh
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
Visions is in in the Enfield location is
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
um is sort of a a country you know home
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
used to be an
 
00:34:13.869 --> 00:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
inn uh that the executive directors
 
00:34:13.879 --> 00:34:16.069 align:start position:0%
inn uh that the executive directors
parents

00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
community where
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
you I live in one of the there's
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
three buildings on the site and I live
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
in one of them with two other
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
residents um Can were you were you
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
receiving Support Services in your condo
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
y yes um so when you describe the home
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
that you're you're currently living in
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
you said that there is there's two other
 
00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:58.230 align:start position:0%
you said that there is there's two other
individuals

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
is that um in that home are there like
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
separate apartments or is this kind of a
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
um where you have your own room but
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's a common limit living area there
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
yes there is um a common area there's a
 
00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:12.470 align:start position:0%
yes there is um a common area there's a
shared

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
shared
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
kitchen and a common living room I do
 
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
have my own space with a sofa and you
 
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
know TV and and my and my own space so
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
um Gatherings if you want to have
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
friends over but then there if you need
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
that and then do you most of your meals
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
um I eat um most of my meals there with
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
um with the fellow residents it would be
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
on the weekends mainly because I work
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
second shift
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
is that in your house oh that's in the
 
00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:02.490 align:start position:0%
is that in your house oh that's in the
main

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:02.500 align:start position:0%
main
 
00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:09.030 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
house can I ask what you do for work I'm
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
a secondary assembler I work for
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
hypertherm oh okay in light industrial
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
consum plasma consumable
 
00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.430 align:start position:0%

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
assembly
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
sweet okay does anyone have any other
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
questions okay now we have a list over
 
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:31.400 align:start position:0%
there of other people that were planning
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
to testify and if someone could bring me
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
that list or if you could oh you have
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
one more question I I I had a question
 
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
for Ben as far as like the makeup of
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
this this
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
um uh Visions um if if the uh we had
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
discussions before about how these types
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
of um facilities are regulated
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
and if it
 
00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:03.430 align:start position:0%
and if it
sounds

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
sounds
 
00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:08.839 align:start position:0%
um like this might be a licensed
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
um the licensed threshold for um what
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
was that the certification was three
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
people and then more than that had to be
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
licensed licensed yes so are you
 
00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
licensed and is the structure um like
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
zoned commercial or is it they do they
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
consider it mixed use or is it um
 
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
considered residential how how is this
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
kind of site set up well I can't speak
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
to the zoning issue I can certainly look
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
into it and get back to you um the the
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
the certification and licensing issue as
 
00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:49.400 align:start position:0%
I imagine you guys are aware is a is a
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
bit of a fraught
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
issue um at the threshold the the um
 
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.030 align:start position:0%
issue um at the threshold the the um
residences

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
residences
 
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
in Enfield are currently certified which
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
they have been for over 10 years because
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
none of
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.829 align:start position:0%
the the
individual

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
apartments are house house more than
 
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.270 align:start position:0%
apartments are house house more than
three

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.069 align:start position:0%
three
people

00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
however uh the department has
 
00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
recently um taken another look at how it
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
construes the uh um 151 I think it's a
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
and how that should apply so um they
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
have uh changed their view of our other
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
two locations which we have completed
 
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
licensing on and um we're quite
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the nfield location
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
because particularly because of issues
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
like potential issues like
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
sprinkling U we have a um you know older
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
structures um which that could has the
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
potential to be um prohibitively
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
expensive and we also uh disagree with
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
the Department about uh the proper
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
issue okay go ahead
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
um when you're talking about
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
the the statute you're talking about the
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
the regul what kind of bucket you fall
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
into whether it's it's um certification
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
required or lure required or are you
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
talking about um some their
 
00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation of a statute that might
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
require sprinklers or what are What
 
00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
specifically were the former so all of
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
these locations are
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
certified the question is whether they
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
also need to be
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
licensed and there
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
are I I don't want to get too deeply
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
into the weeds
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
but we agree with what has always been
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
the view of the Bureau of certification
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
licensing at
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
DHHS which is that locations uh
 
00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:12.109 align:start position:0%
DHHS which is that locations uh
certified

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
certified
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
locations which house individuals with
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities or related
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
conditions three or fewer are subject to
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
certification but do not require
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
licensing so they have
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
essentially taking the view that the the
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
issue is how many what's the headcount
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
Under One Roof rather than what's the
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
headcount in a
 
00:40:37.599 --> 00:40:41.470 align:start position:0%
headcount in a
certified

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
location your your location as as was
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
previously described has three buildings
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
potentially each
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
with uh well there's three people in the
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
one building for sure that we have
 
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.200 align:start position:0%
already heard testimony for um are you
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
talking about um whether they might
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
count the multiple
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
buildings um kind of all as one location
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
and then make you fall under the
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
licensing even though they're
 
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:10.280 align:start position:0%
technically um different buildings and
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
so it's like different roofs no that's
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
not exactly the the way the issue is
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
presenting itself um the there are two
 
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.550 align:start position:0%
presenting itself um the there are two
other

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.150 align:start position:0%
other
settings

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
settings
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
that are potentially going to require
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
licensing one of them is a set of three
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
Apartments uh which are under is which
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
are in one
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
structure and then the other is that the
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
main house is connected to a you could
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
call it an accessory dwelling you could
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
call it a different structure but it has
 
00:41:53.069 --> 00:41:53.079 align:start position:0%
a corridor which allows connection
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
between those buildings and so then the
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
question is you know does that put in
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
the view of the department all of these
 
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
an a number of individuals above
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
three Under One Roof and so would that
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
then require licensing with these
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
uncertainties around um you know the
 
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
fire protection issu the additional fire
 
00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
protection issues which would rise under
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
licensing among also there are um in
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
addition to the initial hurdles there
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
are over 50 additional categories of
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
information docu M mentation which must
 
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
be uh maintained by a facility which is
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
subject to the licensing
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
regime uh rather than simply the
 
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
certification reg regime so it's subtle
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
subtle growth of you know
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
uncompensated uh administrative costs
 
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
issue thank you um
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
so I guess you didn't specifically State
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
this but I guess it was implied and so I
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to to bring it out um if these um
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
fac these uh this facility has three
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
three individuals housed um and is
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
licensed or uh is certified it doesn't
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
require sprinklers but if it was
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed that same
 
00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:27.839 align:start position:0%
structure housing those same number of
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
people would require Sprinklers and
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
therefore would be an a financial burden
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
in on top of the the
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
requirements well first of all I would
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
say if you were building or rehabbing a
 
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
space now that was going to be certified
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
you'd almost certainly have to have it
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
sprinkler we we are talking about uh
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
an older
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
setting and I don't think you can speak
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
in absolutes about what is going to be
 
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.630 align:start position:0%
in absolutes about what is going to be
required

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
from whoever the Fire official is who is
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know ultimately
 
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
deciding what you have to do so it's
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's not totally cut and dry but what
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it from the perspective
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
of you know a risk that maybe
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
presented uh if you know so the other so
 
00:44:33.309 --> 00:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
the settings which are licensed are
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
newer they one of them was a rehab and
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
one of them was a groundup build and
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
they're fully
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
sprinklered just as uh you know I think
 
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
contemporary um Market Apartments would
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
be I shouldn't say that I don't know
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
that that that that's necessarily the
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
case but these These are sprinkled but
 
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
the older these this older setting is is
 
00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.670 align:start position:0%
the older these this older setting is is
not

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm I'm sure that people
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
could look at that and go like well they
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
should be you know and they're hardwired
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the local Fire Authority and people
 
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
could say and we do a lot of you know
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
fire drills you know everyone can get
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
out of there quickly so people could say
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
well you know you you can't have enough
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
fire safety and I certainly understand
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
that view but we also have a history of
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
you know 10 years of operating without
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
incident and you know you know under
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
certification you're required to do
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
periodic um fire drills that include
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
timing of uh getting individuals safely
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
out of the uh physical
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
site thank you for that I'm I'm
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
definitely clear curious about how it is
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
zoned because the um the we just
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
recently passed a law that um
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
essentially said that they can require
 
00:45:56.109 --> 00:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
sprinklers for um residential like multi
 
00:45:56.119 --> 00:45:57.670 align:start position:0%
sprinklers for um residential like multi
family

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh dwelling units up
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
to for
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
three and I want to say three and four
 
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:08.559 align:start position:0%
unit structures and once you go past
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
Four there's a it's a whole different b
 
00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
ball game but I think it I believe it
 
00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
was recently uh a law was changed as far
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
as that and so if it's classifying you
 
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
as a multif family unit structure that
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
may um change but uh how you're kind of
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
what regulation you're allowed to be
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
imposed under um but if it's a a
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
commercial I think commercials is going
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
to more often require Sprinklers and so
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
it it would definitely be valuable if
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
you could follow up on that I'll do that
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
you does anyone have any more questions
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
for Kim and
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
Ben okay so we have a list over there of
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
other people that wanted to testify if
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
someone could bring that would be
 
00:46:55.079 --> 00:46:58.069 align:start position:0%
someone could bring that would be
terrific

00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
terrific
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
yeah you can hand it to representative
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.559 --> 00:47:11.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right let's see the first
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%

00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
life and I went to um bont Regional
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
School District when I was
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
um when I was the senior at Bama High
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
School um I graduated in
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
2015 with no
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
diploma and then I recently
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
graduated um in 2018 with a regular
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
diploma um the high school um age
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
diploma is with kids with disabilities
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
they can graduate when they're 21 years
 
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
old um that was the first time for me
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
that I have experienced this um
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm very grateful that I got um all
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
the work done um and then I recently
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
went to University of New Hampshire um
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
for the union for you program and then I

May
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
um when people asked me about un and AG
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
what it is about

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
did do a lot of internships I worked at

in interested in kind of where it seems
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
like you're currently living at home MH
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
with your parents and you're you uh you
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
have a a job and you're you looking or
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
into um moving and finding a place that
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
um where I guess uh where have you been
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
looking have you looked at any of the um
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
the uh like towns around where you're
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
currently working or are you um and are
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
you actively currently looking um or is
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
there some other barrier like the
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
transportation that kind of rules out
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
the some of the towns that you would
 
01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
maybe want to move to yeah I mean for me
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's just been really difficult because
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
a lot a lot of PE places in New Hamster
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
don't really have
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
transportation like if you were going to
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
the St Boston yes there is but um I have
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
have looks online on Z and um and other
 
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
apps too but the like the the numbers
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
are so high that it could be complicated
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
because people like me have to pay rents
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
and other people have to pay their own
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
rent so um with my job my checks are
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
mostly Sav during my time at work and
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
I'm using
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%

01:02:29.039 --> 01:02:30.109 align:start position:0%
stable account which is really helpful
um

01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's like you can actually save money on
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
your stable account for things like
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
college stuff um you could save it for
 
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:41.240 align:start position:0%

cough as someone yawning um hi my name
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
is Jessica marison I'm a tenant Advocate
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
organizer in Manchester New Hampshire
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
and for the past 3 years and in a few
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
months now I've run a tenant Clinic um
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
and in the tenant Clinic I've met um
 
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
many many people um I've seen many
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
things and I would like to give my
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
opinion on some of those things that
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
I've seen and
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
noticed um we in this room represent
 
01:18:13.470 --> 01:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
many different disabilities our housing
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
options need to be as varied as possible
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
to support all levels or needs I wanted
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure I address that all
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities are different all needs are
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
different and if we can make sure that
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
what is right for each individual is
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
able to be attained I think that's what
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're reaching for here um what I see
 
01:18:35.229 --> 01:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
with I love the Fair Housing Act and the
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
help that nhla has um with helping the
 
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire but
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately what I sadly see is when
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
they have a claim that they contact that
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
group and they try and work through I've
 
01:18:50.629 --> 01:18:50.639 align:start position:0%
had residents evicted before they got
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere with pressing that fair housing
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
act claim one of them recently um was a
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
family of three uh four total the
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
elderly father's now in a
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
shelter um who is on oxygen and the rest
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
of the family we were able to get
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
luckily after a week of being locked out
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
into an apartment I had a understanding
 
01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.590 align:start position:0%
into an apartment I had a understanding
landlord

01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
luckily um emotional service animals I
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
have the biggest difficulty with those
 
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
um for my tenants I have honestly what I
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
tell them now because if you look at the
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
definition of an emotional support
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
animal they are not termed an animal or
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
a pet that is something um equal to a
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
wheelchair a cane a device so I I
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
explain that to them and I tell them
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
don't even tell them you have a cat
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
because you have a medical device you
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
move in they try and kick you out we do
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
a reasonable accommodation and fight it
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
because getting them in there with the
 
01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
emotional service animal has been a
 
01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
fight people are getting turned down
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
left and right um and how do you fight
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
that when you're just fighting to stay
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
house you have to focus on the first
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
things first and that's getting a roof
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
over your head and a lot of these
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
landlords know this um one thing I think
 
01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
would be helpful for those of us I am
 
01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
myself am on disability I've met with
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
Senator the Sheen's office and
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
Congressman Pap's office in DC I think
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
that when one applies for disability
 
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
there should be a box that they can
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
check that housing is needed and once
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
the disab ility rights are granted it
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
should be automatically enrolled into a
 
01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
housing or public housing of some sort
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
maybe there's something the state can do
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
um since the federal government isn't
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
and when those are on disability they
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
have some type of we need some type of
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
office to go to because the other thing
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
I wanted to talk about is Section 8 the
 
01:20:47.229 --> 01:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
average person applies they're on the
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
waiting list eight years the best those
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
on disability can get is a 2-year weight
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
list but that's still too long if they
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
know the Avenues to go to have somebody
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
help expedite their case meaning there's
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
certain paperwork that doctors or other
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
professionals can do I've done it twice
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
luckily where you can help
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
expedite um their case and you basically
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
list out everything that's wrong and why
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
it's so important to get them into
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
housing and why that depends on it that
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
can help expedite a voucher but they
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
have to have um a particular doctor or a
 
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
social working agency that can do it not
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
everyone has access to that so having a
 
01:21:27.870 --> 01:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
state agency where they could call up
 
01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
and have help getting that paperwork
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
done would be helpful with housing
 
01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.270 align:start position:0%
done would be helpful with housing
programs

01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
um and the gentleman was right you can
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
only have a car or a house now it's too
 
01:21:41.709 --> 01:21:41.719 align:start position:0%
hard to have both I also had to give up
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
my car um with disability my income
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
after they deduct my Medicaid or my
 
01:21:50.669 --> 01:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
medicare is only
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
1362 um I would only then income qualify
 
01:21:56.470 --> 01:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
for a little over $400 on an apartment
 
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to find that I have to
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
work luckily I have
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
um a skill set of tenant rights because
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
I had volunteered for many years doing
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
that on my own and have been been able
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
to have work in that um this past
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
January they decided that I made $200 a
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
month too much and took away my
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
disability in January I had to go a
 
01:22:23.709 --> 01:22:23.719 align:start position:0%
month with a lowered pay I lost my
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
housing during that that month because I
 
01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay for my room rental I was in
 
01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
my car got back into a room for rent
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
room for rents can be joke sometimes
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
when people are desperate you can go
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
into not the best situation so I spent a
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
total of seven weeks living in my
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle this um beginning this year
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
during winter time until I could find a
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
room that I could rent
 
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
um because that whole thing got set off
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
I had to lower my income by 200 a month
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
I finally got my disability back I have
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
a glass ceiling because of my disability
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
I can only make so much that doesn't
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
allow me to compete with others when it
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
comes to trying to get an apartment I'm
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to have a good landlord now
 
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
where I rent a room in a shared housing
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
situation um my rent is $900 a month it
 
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
includes my utilities I'm very lucky to
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
have it I don't know how many places
 
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
like this across Manchester that are
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
actually safe to be in also
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
um evictions there's no safety net one
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
of the biggest things I have to explain
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
to people on misinformation is there's
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
no safety net for winter a lot of people
 
01:23:36.990 --> 01:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
still assume that you can't be evicted
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
during winter the next they assume is
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
that if you're disabled or elderly there
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
is a safety net there so those don't end
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
up on the street that's not true I
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
currently work at a shelter in
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I can tell you that is
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
definitely not true um there's a good
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
majority of people there that are
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
disabled um I can't speak too much on
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
that without my boss is okay um but my
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
tenants that I work with was my tenant
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
Clinic um the things I have seen of
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
people of landlords evicting tenants is
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
been horrible um there's a few of them
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
to this day that two years later they're
 
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
still homeless waiting to get some type
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
of Housing
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
and because of no um net out there
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
renovation of victions are making it
 
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
worse for those of us with this ability
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
because it's a threat that's easily done
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
um so for instance just recently I
 
01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:35.719 align:start position:0%
helped somebody with a 540A they got on
 
01:24:35.719 --> 01:24:36.830 align:start position:0%
helped somebody with a 540A they got on
their

01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
540A um they ended up in court for
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
eviction because the whole electric
 
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
needed to be changed out so the
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
renovation eviction was going to go
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
through I was lucky enough to make him a
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
deal with the help of nhla where they
 
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
had seven months of rent taken care of
 
01:24:57.109 --> 01:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
but that's if you have those exact
 
01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
moments there they had the 540A they had
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
me they had nhla not everybody has that
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
um but they have two and a half months
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
left to find a place and that's a mother
 
01:25:09.109 --> 01:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
who is
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
disabled um the fiance just had to have
 
01:25:14.830 --> 01:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
major surgery himself I don't know how
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to move in a couple months
 
01:25:17.950 --> 01:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
but that's what they face so if they
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
complain about any issues we're
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
terrified too because the next thing is
 
01:25:24.390 --> 01:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
a renovation eviction and where are we
 
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:26.360 align:start position:0%
going to go after that there's no safety
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
nets the shelters are full there's
 
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
weight list on every one of them
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and last um because of this there are
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
people out there taking advantage of
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
those on disability right now in
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester um just to be safe I don't
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
want to mention the person's name um but
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
I've spoke with many
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
people that have been through it or know
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
those who have this person will find
 
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
those who are on disability to get them
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
into his their housing it's $200 a week
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes um on disability you can bring
 
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
home a range of 700 a month sometimes
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
lower even all the way up to like 1,700
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
the range is in there um so for someone
 
01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
that's only at 900 a month they're left
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
with about $100 a month to meet all
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
their basic needs
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
also um and this brings us to Rachel I
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be up here to give Rachel
 
01:26:24.990 --> 01:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
support okay thank you
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay Rachel are you ready to testify I
 
01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
guess so
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for
 
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
coming okay my name is Rachel gagy I am
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
disabled I became disabled as of
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
200 200 2008 I had two heart attacks by
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
then I had two
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
strokes and nine
 
01:26:52.109 --> 01:26:52.119 align:start position:0%
bypasses because I have got a two blood
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
disorders one is antix phospherous lied
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
lupus what it does is it causes your
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
blood to run real thick and pasty like
 
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
toothpaste so I got a lot of blood clots
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
I had to go in for a double bypass on my
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
hip but they had to do a catheter test
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
because my heart was
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
congested and that's what brought on the
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
two heart
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
attacks it damaged three vental
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
Valves and one of them was my a itic
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
valve your aor
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
valve and they were doing all right for
 
01:27:29.679 --> 01:27:31.229 align:start position:0%
valve and they were doing all right for
the

01:27:31.229 --> 01:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
past 8 16 years
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
and couple years ago when we were
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
evicted because of a renovation eviction
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
now all the stress has caused it to
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
become very
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
congested it turned it from Jello to
 
01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.229 align:start position:0%
congested it turned it from Jello to
concrete

01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
so in 2 days I have to go in for a valve
 
01:28:01.950 --> 01:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
replacement because it's got a small
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
slit that's only letting a little bit of
 
01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:05.669 align:start position:0%
slit that's only letting a little bit of
blood

01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
blood
 
01:28:05.679 --> 01:28:08.030 align:start position:0%
blood
out

01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:11.430 align:start position:0%
out
so

01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
um took me two years to find an
 
01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
apartment because the rents are so
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
high I have got three social securities
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
I got mine my husband's and my
 
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:25.310 align:start position:0%
I got mine my husband's and my
granddaughter

01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
granddaughter
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay me and my husband are both disabled
 
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
my grand granddaughter's got Survivor
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
because her father had
 
01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
died between the three of us we're
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
barely making e barely making it we're
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
lucky if we got five bucks left by the
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
fifth of the month and that has to last
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
us the entire
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
month okay our rent is 1750 a month we
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
only make 3150
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
so the rent takes up just about all of
 
01:29:05.229 --> 01:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
it we barely make enough to I say most
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
of my light bill I I'm lucky if I can
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
put 25 bucks on it a month I got a shut
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
off notice by the 24th that I have to
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
pay on and I don't even know how I'm
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
what Rachel wanted to stress was that
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
um with her heart condition for 15 years
 
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
it was doing okay and over the past
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
three years of the stress of being
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
homeless for two years and fighting to
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
get in her current place it exacerbated
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
her condition to where she has to have a
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
valve replacement so it talks about um
 
01:29:47.629 --> 01:29:47.639 align:start position:0%
the disabilities that are worsened um
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
especially with those that are homeless
 
01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
with diabetes I see many missing toes
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
and feet um because they're not able to
 
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
properly care for insulin and food and
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
taking care of them um her income
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
qualifying when they moved into her
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
current apartment it was $300 less a
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
month but then the first year of living
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
there it went up
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
300 um so if they were to try and income
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
qualify to move again they probably with
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
the way rent is right now they may not
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
qualify definitely for their place but
 
01:30:18.669 --> 01:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
for another it'd be kind of shaky and
 
01:30:20.590 --> 01:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
she currently lives with many repairs
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
that need done but her fear of reporting
 
01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.950 align:start position:0%
that need done but her fear of reporting
those

01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay right now we just moved from the
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
second floor to the first floor because
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
I have to go in for that operation yeah
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
so I talked to my landlord you know when
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
the apartment came open cuz my land my
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
doctor don't want me doing a lot of
 
01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
stairs he was nice enough to let me go
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
downstairs and but there's a lot of
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
repairs that need to be done and I told
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%

01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%

saids if you get me the parts we can fix
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
those windows because the balances each
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
there's five out of six windows that
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%

talk to them and get them we can install
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%

01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
electricity where am I going to
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
go I would have to leave the
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
apartment I can't afford another
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
apartment I can barely afford the one I
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.790 --> 01:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
do and then he'll evict me for
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
it or what did he say if he does certain
 
01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
repairs he'd have to raise he told me he
 
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
says if I keep having to put repairs in
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
your Apes I'll have to ra raise the rent
 
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
he raises it anymore he ain't going to
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
be able to afford it have either of you
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
applied for um housing V
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
I have yeah how long I I have another
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
two years to wait for
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
it and Jessica have you I'm on the
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
waiting list they told me eight years um
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
she was told two years it's been almost
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
two years but now they're still telling
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
her another
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
two and I and just in case there's an
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
issue with this um uh currently housing
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
has a new thing where they're able to go
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
online and sign in and can say that they
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
want to stay on this waiting list and
 
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
make any changes needed when I went in
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
to help Rachel with hers they had her
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
income at 3.8
 
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
million there was something that
 
01:34:39.990 --> 01:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
happened in the conversion or something
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
so there might be other people that are
 
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing this that possibly could be
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
why she's lower on the waiting list
 
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
because the income is not necessitating
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
anything we did change it though I don't
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
know how many other people are running
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
into stuff like this so I just wanted to
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
bring it to someone's attention in case
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
needed so when you applied was that with
 
01:35:01.709 --> 01:35:01.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing or was it with
 
01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester housing both okay okay I
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
commonly in the tenant Clinic we'll have
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
the tenants sign up for both um New
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing tends to be a little
 
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
quicker but they're different vouchers
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
and then we go to the next rung you got
 
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
places like Beach Hill property
 
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
Metropolis Property Management places
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
like that around the community that
 
01:35:22.350 --> 01:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
offer um the 50 60% Ami housing where
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
you have a minimum and a maximum and
 
01:35:27.310 --> 01:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
then they also usually offer the 30% Ami
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
where they pay 30% of their income so
 
01:35:31.350 --> 01:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
what it looks like is getting them on
 
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
all the different levels so they can be
 
01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere while they wait and even those
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
community-based projects are easily one
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
to two years waight lless too okay wow
 
01:35:43.870 --> 01:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
questions I know you've got to
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
go yeah
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
okay just a quick one what did you say
 
01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
that was Ami area median income and so
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
there are programs that your rent is
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
based on that in a community program
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
yeah it's uh Workforce housing is looked
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
at more as 50 and 60% so like beachill
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
property is a great one to explain it
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
with they have um two different programs
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
there they have one where you have to
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
meet a minimum but you can't go over
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
that maximum and that's the 50 60% range
 
01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:21.159 align:start position:0%
and then they have the other program um
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
where you would pay 30% of your income
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's similar to a HUD
 
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
program thank you okay um but I'd also
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
like to bring up that there's many
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
Project based
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
housing communities that are losing
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
their um they're always set for anywhere
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
from 10 25 30 some years there's a lot
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
of communities that are losing that cost
 
01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
effective part so there's going to be a
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
lot more
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
people facing homelessness disabled and
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%

funding but we do um I'm on the
 
01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
committee to help folks that need
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
modifications in their home to live
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
safely thank you so much uh so certainly
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about the issues
 
01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.030 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot about the issues
around

01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
affordability with our with our house
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
housing crisis but uh accessibility is
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
just as important as well uh and just to
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
give you a a bit of data here so the uh
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
US Department of Housing and Urban
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
Development HUD periodically uses the
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
American housing survey to assess the
 
01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
stock of homes accessible to those with
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
people with
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities the
 
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
2019 American housing survey data shows
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
that almost two in 10 US households
 
01:39:23.709 --> 01:39:23.719 align:start position:0%
include a person with accessibility
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
needs so this may be someone like me who
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
uses a wheelchair a walker cane whatever
 
01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
uh but of those households 4 in 10
 
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
reported that their homes do not have
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
accessible accessibility features such
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
as entry-level bedrooms or full
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
bathrooms so we've got a lot of folks
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
out there like me who are living in
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
places that are just not equipped for us
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
and we've got no where else to
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
go only a very small share of households
 
01:40:02.189 --> 01:40:02.199 align:start position:0%
reported plans to install such features
 
01:40:04.790 --> 01:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
or to make accessibility related
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
improvements to their homes uh obviously
 
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
there are home modification programs out
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
there but funding is limited and you
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
know there's there's only just so much
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
folks in July 2023 three a hearing held
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
by the Senate special committee on Aging
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
in Congress found that
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
26% of the US population identify as
 
01:40:36.189 --> 01:40:36.199 align:start position:0%
having a
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
disability by 2030 one in5 Americans
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
will be over the age of
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
65 and keeping these numbers in mind the
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee found that less than 5% of the
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
National Housing Supply is accessible
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
and less than 1% is what folks would
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
consider to be wheelchair friendly so
 
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
that 5% you know they might have a ramp
 
01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
to get in they might just have uh an
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
entry level that's Street know that's
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
that's street level uh but the bathroom
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
might not be accessible there may not be
 
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
a bedroom on the first floor things like
 
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
that so now how do we address this how
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
do we how do we solve this problem
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
retrofitting older homes and most of our
 
01:41:30.109 --> 01:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
homes are quite old is just
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
prohibitively expensive in a lot of
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
cases it just doesn't make sense so I
 
01:41:38.669 --> 01:41:38.679 align:start position:0%
think the real solution to all of this
 
01:41:42.669 --> 01:41:42.679 align:start position:0%
is really hammering home the idea of
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
supporting Universal Design and getting
 
01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh contractors and property developers
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
to really get get behind this if even
 
01:41:57.629 --> 01:41:57.639 align:start position:0%
you know one or two% of new developments
 
01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:01.159 align:start position:0%
adhere to Universal designs so that you
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
know everything that's vital is on the
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
first floor
 
01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh wider wider hallways wider
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
doorways bathrooms with uh no slit
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
material things of that nature u i mean
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
these are going to be great not only for
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
folks like me and Jenny but will also
 
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
allow people to you know find a home
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
move into a home and age in that home
 
01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
you know because we want we want people
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to live in their homes for
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
for their whole lives it's what a lot of
 
01:42:37.470 --> 01:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
people want and unfortunately again a
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
lot of situations where somebody's
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
living in a home and they get older or
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
they have an accident or something God
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
forent and now that home doesn't work
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:42:53.790 --> 01:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
anymore so uh you know
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
obviously that's something that's going
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
to take time you know for these new
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
buildings to to be built and all that
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
but I think I think it really is the the
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
most effective solution to to this
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
particular accessibility problem and I'd
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
have okay does Jennifer want to speak
 
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
first and then we can ask questions of
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
you all right I just want to give an
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
example of being on the um our amp
 
01:43:28.430 --> 01:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
committee our access modification
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
committee program committee we get our
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
biggest um requests are and when I say
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
we are the means of Last Resort so when
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
they come through Granite State
 
01:43:39.589 --> 01:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
Independent Living we do try to re to
 
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
search out other access to funds for
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
folks our biggest two are ramps and
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
bathrooms ramps can range from
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
$4500 to $99,500
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
that's for one ramp in a single home to
 
01:43:56.669 --> 01:43:56.679 align:start position:0%
be safe for someone to get in and out of
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
their home bathroom modifications can
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
range from 5,000 to
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
$10,000 now I do want to let you know
 
01:44:07.709 --> 01:44:07.719 align:start position:0%
that it is not medically
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
necessary according to the state that a
 
01:44:13.589 --> 01:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
person has to have a
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
bathroom they can have a shower C Chair
 
01:44:19.990 --> 01:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
by their bed and can take a bed
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
bath so these are these are obstacles
 
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
that people people face every single day
 
01:44:27.629 --> 01:44:27.639 align:start position:0%
I sustained a spinal cord injury 16
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
years ago I was 26 years old live in my
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
dream at that time and and enjoying life
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
and and the blink of a eye I had an
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
accident that um that uh uh sustained a
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
spinal cord injury did I ever think that
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
this was going to happen of course not
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
did my family ever think this was going
 
01:44:48.669 --> 01:44:48.679 align:start position:0%
to happen definitely not but I am very
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
grateful for my family and friends as I
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
have been able to have us very strong
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
support system and so for me I do live
 
01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
independently on my own and that just
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
happened about four and a half years ago
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
I did get my own place with my my dog
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
and um with a caregiver that lives
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
beside me that would be the only way I'd
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
be able to do this um but as far as
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
funding I had to get um I had to get a a
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
second you know out that safe for me so
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
I had to get a ramp put on the back of
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
that um doorways for me to be able to
 
01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
get in easy as my hands don't function
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
the same way anymore my bathroom needed
 
01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:32.440 align:start position:0%
to be modified I needed to get um uh
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
need to make sure my My Fire EX um my um
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
just you know that it was safe fire for
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
fire for Access um in and out safely two
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
different ways these were a lot of
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
things that cost a lot of money and to
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
find funding for this now um earlier
 
01:45:50.669 --> 01:45:50.679 align:start position:0%
they mentioned CFI choices for
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
Independence it's a wonderful program
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
that people can have and they do help
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
with a lot of funding but again it's
 
01:45:59.870 --> 01:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
another obstacle a lot more paperwork
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
that people have to go through luckily
 
01:46:03.990 --> 01:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
at Grant State Independent Living we
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
have a really great support system that
 
01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:08.679 align:start position:0%
we will help folks that are consumers
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
figure out this paperwork but I myself
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
can speak from Pure experience it's very
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
stressful every year I have to restate
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes I'm disabled no I'll never walk
 
01:46:23.709 --> 01:46:23.719 align:start position:0%
again yes I need need help taking a
 
01:46:27.149 --> 01:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
shower yes I need help getting dressed
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
yes I need help preparing my food yes I
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
need help going to the bathroom why do I
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
have to state that all the time and
 
01:46:38.109 --> 01:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
every year and I am not the only one
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
that goes through this and to have that
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
all taken away from you and then to just
 
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
try to have a little bit of Independence
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
again in your life and it gets taken
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
even further away from you because
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
there's no way you can afford it there's
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
no way you can get in it there's no way
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
you can maneuver there's no way you can
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
park these are just obstacles and these
 
01:47:05.589 --> 01:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
just add one by one by one so it's so
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
each and every obstacle just adds on the
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork and you're just a piece of
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
paper and that's what you are until you
 
01:47:15.790 --> 01:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
make your voice heard until you advocate
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
for yourself and by you all um the
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
members of your committee allowing us to
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
be able to come up here and speak on beh
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
to of myself and others is a great
 
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
Advantage for everybody and I just would
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
like for you to know that at Grant and
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
state Independent Living we do have many
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
programs for people but there are many
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
others that are out there that offer
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
it's just finding the resources and
 
01:47:40.589 --> 01:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
finding the help and that can be really
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
difficult as
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%

01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
you can share that Lessons Learned kind
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
of a thing that might you know shed shed
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
light on kind of
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
where um we
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
might uh look for either Solutions or or
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
or identify kind of the problems like
 
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
the scope of problem yes so I um I with
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
the luck of my family I was able to move
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
home with my parents they fully
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
renovated um the house uh to the best of
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
their ability our ramp is not
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
Ada but it's
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
doable um only in the
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
winter um but uh no so uh it took it
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
took um it well I actually got put I
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
signed up to be put on a weit list and
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
that weight list was 2 to six years to
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
find a place that' be accessible for me
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
now not only did I need to find a place
 
01:49:56.109 --> 01:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
that was accessible for me but I also
 
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
needed to find at least a two-bedroom
 
01:49:59.790 --> 01:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
apartment because I would have need to
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
have have a living caregiver during this
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
time living at my parents I do have um
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
Personal Care attendance through Grant
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
State Independent Living so I am also a
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
consumer of theirs so I did have people
 
01:50:13.709 --> 01:50:13.719 align:start position:0%
helping me morning afternoon and night
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
um getting me up getting me going and
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
getting me back into bed with that with
 
01:50:19.629 --> 01:50:19.639 align:start position:0%
that help I was able to also be able to
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
get back to work now um the two to year
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
I was looking into conquer Manchester
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
nashaa these are all um cities that are
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
very far I I'm live in antrum a small
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
town but it's small in quaint and it's
 
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
where I grew up and and where my heart
 
01:50:40.870 --> 01:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
is so that 2 to six year weight was very
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
difficult and then I looked at the price
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
range and with what I make and with what
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
I get with SSDI there would have been no
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
possible way without the help of if um
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
if I was to ask my parents to help me
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
with paying rent and um as each year
 
01:51:00.669 --> 01:51:00.679 align:start position:0%
goes on 26 27 28 years old 29 years old
 
01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
I'm really not still wanting to ask my
 
01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
parents to help me um not that they
 
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't if this is what I really wanted
 
01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
they laid it on the table for me that if
 
01:51:14.189 --> 01:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
we were to find a home within the area
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
that would be able to be modified to
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
work good for me but to stay close to my
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
family so I'm not far away in case of
 
01:51:22.239 --> 01:51:23.430 align:start position:0%
family so I'm not far away in case of
emercy

01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
emercy
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
would I be up for that and I said of
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
course I would so we searched for I
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
think it took almost a year for us to
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
find a home um that would work perfectly
 
01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
and it did it ended up panning out and
 
01:51:39.149 --> 01:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
it took us only about eight months to
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
make it um accessible my dad's quite a
 
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
good handyman and with being in a small
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
town um small town love so they came in
 
01:51:47.950 --> 01:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
to help us well with making it even more
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
accessible for me to get into my house
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
so I would say the first is the way list
 
01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:55.719 align:start position:0%
the weight list is um
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
terrifying and then you look at the cost
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
and the cost of rent is twice as
 
01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:04.719 align:start position:0%
terrifying um and uh I also wanted to
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to work but I'm not
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
sure if that would have been able to
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
happen either if I move further away
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
from my Offices here in conquer um but
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
working remotely from home mostly so um
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
question does anyone have any questions
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%

to what her future is going to look like
 
01:55:24.990 --> 01:55:25.000 align:start position:0%

01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
support person in her life um where is
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
she going to be able to live affordably
 
01:55:36.990 --> 01:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
where um as um my friend Laura um spoke
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
about you know where is going to be
 
01:55:42.069 --> 01:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
accessible for her wolf bro is very
 
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
rural there's not a lot of sidewalks on
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
the side roads except for in town at the
 
01:55:50.669 --> 01:55:50.679 align:start position:0%
moment but I'm thinking ahead as to what
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
her options will be what choices will be
 
01:55:56.069 --> 01:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
where does she want to live either in
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
the city or in a rural area and even for
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
myself being um a lower income single
 
01:56:05.229 --> 01:56:05.239 align:start position:0%

01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
that I live in Herman Hill in wolfboro
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%

01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:16.679 align:start position:0%
developers I've lived there for 10 years
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
um and it is uh an income based
 
01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing um community that I

absolutely love it's beautiful I feel
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
very fortunate to live there and
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
currently Lakes Region Community
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
developers is working on another phase
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
of the development that would
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
include uh Supportive Housing for people
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities my
 
01:56:45.629 --> 01:56:45.639 align:start position:0%
daughter Katie is served through uh our
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
local area agency which is Northern
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services not the agency I work for
 
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region Community Services
 
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
and so Northern is working and
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
partnering with um Lakes Region
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
Community developers our biggest hurdle
 
01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
and I know you've heard this is at all
 
01:57:06.669 --> 01:57:06.679 align:start position:0%
the local meetings that I've attended um
 
01:57:09.430 --> 01:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
in the town of wolfboro and other areas
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
when Supportive Housing or
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
non-traditional types of residents um
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
whether uh they are persons with
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities or mental health concerns
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
or uh perhaps uh recovering from
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
substance abuse any kind of Supportive
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
Housing there's a stigma and I am
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
hearing all the time the knot in my
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
backyard so I go constantly my kids
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
growing up they're like Mom you're going
 
01:57:39.790 --> 01:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
to another town meeting can you just
 
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
stay home and but I would drag them
 
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
everywhere because I thought it was
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
important that people see the faces of
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
those who live in lower income housing
 
01:57:52.589 --> 01:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
or Supportive Housing and that's me and
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
my kids my daughters uh who are 18
 
01:57:58.950 --> 01:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
starting out in college someday I'm
 
01:58:02.109 --> 01:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
going to be passing the torch to them in
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
looking out for their younger sister and
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
I really want to make sure that through
 
01:58:10.069 --> 01:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
the work of this committee and beyond
 
01:58:13.149 --> 01:58:13.159 align:start position:0%
that there are choices um not only for
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
my daughter Katie but for my daughters
 
01:58:18.189 --> 01:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
once they graduate high
 
01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
school they already graduated high
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
school I can't believe it um once they
 
01:58:24.990 --> 01:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
graduate College they are not even sure
 
01:58:27.270 --> 01:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
how they are going to afford to live
 
01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:31.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere and then taking on potentially
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
in their future um caring for their
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
sister and what is that going to look
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
like and how are they going to be able
 
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
to afford it um so as a mom I have a lot
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%

that you have and um we had we heard a
 
02:00:15.629 --> 02:00:15.639 align:start position:0%
lot of um discussion I guess about um
 
02:00:22.109 --> 02:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
like the walkability and and the um the
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
the proximity to services and stuff like
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
that and then also kind of uh interested
 
02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:29.189 align:start position:0%
that and then also kind of uh interested
in

02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
how how much of the development is
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing versus um
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
Market um is that you know 25% or can
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
you give me some idea of so I I don't
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
have the exact figures but I can I know
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
most of my neighbors um that it is Prim
 
02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
primarily Workforce housing the primary
 
02:00:57.310 --> 02:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
residents are all families but there are
 
02:00:59.629 --> 02:00:59.639 align:start position:0%
also people with disabilities and
 
02:01:03.149 --> 02:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
several um retired uh folks that live
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
there as well um and it is primarily
 
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce lower income um you do have to
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
meet a certain threshold of income to be
 
02:01:16.709 --> 02:01:16.719 align:start position:0%
able to live there and then you can't
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
make you know pass a certain amount as
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
well so but I think Carmen can certainly
 
02:01:25.229 --> 02:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
give you those facts and figures if she
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%

anything else to say before we adjourn
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
the meeting I'm a little concerned that
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
not that someone people might have had
 
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
to leave early and since there was a lot
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
of people that came to testify obviously
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
it's hard to
 
02:03:26.470 --> 02:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
um that people may have time constraints
 
02:03:28.990 --> 02:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
but we have at least one more meeting
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
right yes that um anyone
 
02:03:34.870 --> 02:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
that had to leave early could could
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
still come and and testify or obviously
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony if they're
 
02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
watching uh you know catching the last
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
of it even though they had to leave yeah
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
right that well and and again my name is
 
02:03:53.229 --> 02:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
Kathy stab and if you go to the um um
 
02:03:55.069 --> 02:03:55.079 align:start position:0%

there you know it's I can never remember
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%

02:04:04.589 --> 02:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
agenda so that they can get know when
 
02:04:08.350 --> 02:04:08.360 align:start position:0%

02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
meeting and to just not have people I
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know if we can or should
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
we do sure about Zoom but okay you want
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.270 --> 02:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know how you want to do it
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
I guess you're kind of in charge but I
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:03.149 --> 02:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
maybe I guess if you don't want to have
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
a a separate meeting for regarding it
 
02:06:10.549 --> 02:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
like maybe having like people submit
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
their thoughts to you and then you could
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
draft something and then we can I don't
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
know if we have to vote to accept it or
 
02:06:19.950 --> 02:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
what what what is the procedure as far
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
as that but I've been counting on you to
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
