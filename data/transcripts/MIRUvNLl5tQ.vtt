programs um and how they they relate to
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
to the department um so you can see that
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
we oversee the national school lunch
 
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
program um which is the the one that
 
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
might be known best um at here and then
 
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
um with within that we have the fresh
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%

office also oversees the food for the
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
child and adult care food program so um
 
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
that might be something that um you
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
might not be aware of that this office
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
although they're licensed at DHHS this
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
office does oversee the food portion of
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
that program um and then the summer food
 
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
service program and those are all of the
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
programs that take place during the the
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
months that school is not in session and
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
we also offer the special milk program
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
um and these programs are all federally
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
funded through the USDA US Department of
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um and
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
100% um completely all federal funds
 
00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
there you'll see um in in the next few
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
pages there are some supplemental State
 
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
programs um flipping to page three um
 
00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
the next three pages are going to be the
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement rates depending on
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
what program they are um so the first
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
page page three in front of you is the
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
national school lunch program and those
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
are the the federal reimbursement rates
 
00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
for um July 1 they work up the the state
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year so July 1 to June 30th um
 
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
and there is um flipping to page four
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit um more
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive breakdown of what the
 
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate is for the federal um
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
and then you can see the state portion
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
too any questions on and that is just
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
related to the rates there are just
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
related to the school l reimbursal
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
program that's correct
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
yes repres
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
papic Mr chair and thank you for being
 
00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
here I'm just looking at the page three
 
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
the SEC the severe need
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
launch two
 
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
cents why do the feds do you have any
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
idea why the feds consider an additional
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
two cents to be U addressing a severe
 
00:07:59.869 --> 00:07:59.879 align:start position:0%
need lunch um I would like to be able to
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
speak to that but unfortunately I'm not
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
sure of their um algorithm on figuring
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
that out thank you I'm just trying to
 
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
avoid any uh two cents worth jokes here
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
so I'll be quiet now thank
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
you so on the next page will you talked
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
about the the breakdown for the
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
breakfast lunch doesn't have any
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
breakdown does that imply that it's
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
totally Federal that's correct there is
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
a a state um match that is paid through
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
lunch but that is a set amount that we
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
um get every year that's within our our
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
budget um but the the breakfast portion
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
is based upon the meal and so that's why
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
I broke it out in that way because
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
that's depending upon how many meals are
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
served that um and there's a chart in
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
here that'll show you um comparison of
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
last year on how much was paid out
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
federally um for the meals that were
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
served so the lunch just say they give
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
you a black Grant of some amount of
 
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
money unrelated to the number of meals
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
you question okay um so moving on to
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
page five um these are the reimbursement
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
rates for the child and adult care um
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
food program again these rates are um as
 
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
of July 1 to June
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
30th um and these are dependent upon um
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
there's a number of items that that go
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
into um how they're determined at the
 
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
the sponsor level um for for the child
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
and adult care
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
program and then um flipping to page six
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
these are the reimbursement rates um you
 
00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
know USDA wouldn't be um USDA unless
 
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
they thre a curve um in here so the the
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
summer rates are actually um calendar
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
year um so you can see that at the top
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
and those are from um January to to
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
December um and these were actually um
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
hot off the press just just released um
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
to get into the packet for for this
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
coming summer that we're we have already
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
rep Murray thank you very much um I
 
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to open up a can of worms but
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
last year last budget cycle there was
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
confusion about the summer program and I
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
was saying you know that the the this
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
program provides meals for students
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
during the school year but because the
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
program had money throughout the year
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
people seem to be confused that they
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
were thinking that oh but they're
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
they're still getting fed during the
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
summer it's like no they're actually not
 
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
and and that money goes you know it's
 
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
what the parents have to pay to pick it
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
up and we were trying to have remember
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
the feed the kids program and it's just
 
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
it was having a hard time trying to
 
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
understand that the kids are still going
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
to have lunch in the summer but it's not
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
covered by this program even though the
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
program's dispersed throughout the year
 
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
can you know what I'm talking about can
 
00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:48.519 align:start position:0%
you speak to that a little bit because
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
it got very confusing and it was we're
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
trying to make the point that the cost
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
goes back onto the parents if we didn't
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
have this program for the summer so can
 
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
you just sure make it clearer than I can
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
I I think within the the last two year
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
two or three years there is um a new
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
program um that USDA has come up with
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
which is sebt or summer EBT so that
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
program is completely separate um that
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
is um a program that's operated through
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
DHHS Department of Health and Human
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
Services so this um summer food service
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
program has certain qualifications on
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
whether a um a site whether that be um a
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar building or or a um a
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
camp site um an outdoor site on how they
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
qualify so so there's certain parameters
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
in that so there are some um schools or
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar buildings that might
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
not qualify per the USDA um regulations
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
to um offer meals at what we call no
 
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
cost to to those students so um it and a
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
site might be open and what that means
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
is that that any child can go go to that
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
location um they don't have to go to
 
00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
school there but is an open sight where
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
a child can go and get a meal during
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
those summer months um so does that does
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
that help yeah thank you it was just
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
there was for some people there seemed
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
to be a gap that uh not understanding
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
that you know these are children who
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
have a need and if it's not provided by
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
these programs it needs to be provided
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
by the parents which is an additional
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
burden for a family that is already
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with poverty issues and that you
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
know children do have lunch in the
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
summertime and it doesn't end at the end
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the school year but um it was just I
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
would like to avoid uh going down that
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole this year if we can by
 
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
making trying to help people understand
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
that this is that summer program to feed
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
the children so and we do have um put
 
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
together a map of where those summer
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
sites are so once they are approved in
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
our um in through our office then we do
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
put that map out so and that's publicly
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
so you can click on that map it's
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
interactive to show um there's also a
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
phone number that you can call to say
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
where is the closest place for me to get
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
a a summer um summer meal and it and
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
again it might not be at a brick and
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
mortar building school but the open
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
sight might be um you know at a at a
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
playground or or what that that might
 
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.310 align:start position:0%
playground or or what that that might
look

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
like repres papovich thank you Mr chair
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
just to make sure I understood this
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
because it is obviously a very important
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
topic I understand
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
that most kids will have access through
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
food throughout the summer they just got
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the proper site to
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
collect the lunch is you were saying
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
that a few sites may not be qualified
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
would that prevent any kids from getting
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
these lunches or will they just have to
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
go to maybe another site that's less
 
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
convenient I'm trying to understand what
 
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
the impact of those sites that may not
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
be qualified is on you know the ability
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
of kids and their parents to access this
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
sure um and thank you for the the
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
question there um for for those brick
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
and mortar buildings that that don't
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
qualify um and if there is another open
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
site that is near um you know where that
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
child might live they can go to that
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
site there are some locations that are
 
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
um that do operate a summer program but
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
they're closed sites which means that
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
those therefore enrolled students that
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
might be a YMCA or something along along
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
those lines but um and that's all
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
labeled in the map whether it's an open
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
site whether it's a closed site um and
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
and again that map um does come out
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
around um June or July um because we
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
have to go through the application
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
process to to ensure that they do
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
operate so is the S fsp program the
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
closed site program um it's a mix it's
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
mixed um so the summer food service
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
program depending upon on um your
 
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
application and what location you submit
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
for it could be an open site it could be
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
a closed site there are um specific
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
things that we look for in the
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
application process so you can qualify
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
for either or both the
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
sfsp and the or the
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
SBT I go ahead so the EBT is a separate
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
program and so that's where they receive
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
their electronic benefits on um I think
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
it's a card system and so that is
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
separate and not part of this program so
 
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
if you have I think the there's
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
confusion between the two things being
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
the same and there separate benefits
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
programs okay so so the pop-up thing had
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the EBT thing that
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
was part of the fsp thing okay so then
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
explain to me
 
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
the difference in qualification between
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
the fsp program and the EBT program
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
they're both deal is something that DHHS
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
would determine the qualifications on
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
who those families or student
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
participants are are our program would
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
be separate from that in our
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
determination I thought you said you
 
00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:06.759 align:start position:0%
managed it or something no we don't do
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
we do not manage EBT oh that's just DHS
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
DHS DHS do they overlap might they
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
overlap we are required to have um a
 
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding I think it
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
is um because it is also a program that
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
I think the USDA is promoting and so the
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
requirements to receive funding require
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
us to coordinate our efforts together
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
but they are two separate programs okay
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
and how do you coordinate them so I'll
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
let you speak to that a little bit more
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
it's really mostly through data sharing
 
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
but sure um it operates in the same way
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
that we um currently have anou for those
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
students that are directly certified um
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
from DHHS that that come over to us um
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
so it operates in in the same way that
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
um we would do data sharing um between
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
the two and that's what the
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
states and is the implication that with
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
that amendment of understanding you all
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
know how to divy things up so that
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
you're handling a group and they're
 
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079 align:start position:0%
handling a group and they're independent
 
00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.789 align:start position:0%
handling a group and they're independent
so

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
um summer um SBT or summer EBT is fully
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
operational at um at
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS if I I think I I which one's it
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
DHHS EBT EBT okay I said said the other
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
one okay yeah um and so they handle all
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
all of that um and they have certain um
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
qualifications and application processes
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
specific for that program um and then
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
the summer food service
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
program we is summer food service
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
program provides the meal so at the site
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
we are providing that meal to that
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
student whereas EBT is those are funds
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
that are provided to that
 
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
family so you could qualify for both
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm trying to understand yes
 
00:18:04.029 --> 00:18:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
you question okay um so so those are the
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates um and um flipping
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
seven um so this chart just gives a um
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
analysis of the meals that were served
 
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
from last school year based on the free
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
or reduced or um P what USDA calls paid
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
status um you can see that the federal
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate there's a column for
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement rate there's a
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
column for State reimbursement rate and
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
then the total of State funding that was
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
paid out um and then the total of
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
federal funding that was paid out the
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
top section is for breakfast and then
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
the bottom section is for lunch um and
 
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
then at the complete bottom of the page
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
you can see the total amount that was
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
paid out for fy2 for um for state and
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
also Federal and keep in mind this um
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
this one is just for the national school
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
lunch program I thought having that
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
comparison and the numbers broken down
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
beneficial go represent
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair looking on
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
page seven I'm looking at um the last
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom line of the spreadsheet the
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
state lunch part yes you know when when
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
you look at breakfast the state State
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
fing is broken down between the various
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
types of meals the state lunch does not
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
seem to be broken down can you help me
 
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
understand why sure um the the state
 
00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
lunch is based on um a match amount and
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the aster that's on
 
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom that corresponds with the
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch um that is broken
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
down in RSA 189
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
111a if I
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
may thank you so just to better
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
understand it um the state essentially
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
provides the same reimbursement for any
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
type of lunch so you guys didn't break
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
it down by free lunch reduced lunch or
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
100% not fnr that's correct it's based
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
on a dollar amount that um then is based
 
00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
on a formula that is given back to to
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
the schools but if I wanted to break it
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
down I could just do it proportionally
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
based on the number of meals
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
served um NOP but if you wanted that
 
00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
breakdown I could get it for you I don't
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
think I would like to request that at
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
this time cuz I'm not sure how
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
meaningful that is I'm just trying to
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
understand how the system works for now
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to create more work at
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
you so what is the difference between
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
free lunch reduced lunch 100% fnr lunch
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
and state lunch is it different kids
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
qualifying for different programs so um
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
the the meal type is based on the USDA
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
um regulations on um and that the free
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
lunch is for um 13 30% up to Poverty
 
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
Level the free lunch is 185 up to
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
Poverty Level reduced lunch I mean um
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
excuse me the reduced lunch thank you
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
and then anything over that um is cons
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
what's considered a paid lunch and then
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
the paid lunch prices are configured at
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
the local level and then what's the
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
state lunch is it independent of those
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
other three um the the state lunch is
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
just a dollar amount that's that's not
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
um that's just saying that the state
 
00:21:27.149 --> 00:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
pays this much amount for um the lunch
 
00:21:27.159 --> 00:21:33.950 align:start position:0%
pays this much amount for um the lunch
match

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
okay representative Murray um for the
 
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
lunch part uh the state pays
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
nothing we pay for the breakfast we
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't pay for lunch so all programs and
 
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
states that participate in the USDA
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
programs have to have some sort of State
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
match and so they determine what our
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
matches and then we have the our the
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
wellness part that's considered in RSA
 
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
1891 11a that three cents and then the
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
30 cents so the state has to put up a
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
portion we use that and say okay this is
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
our match for those federal dollars to
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
be able to keep coming in so we couldn't
 
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
reduce that down because then we
 
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be meeting the requirements and
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
they definitely want to make sure that
 
00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
we keep that that match going but
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
looking at this it appears that we use
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
that match for
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
breakfast not for lunch lunch is all
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
zeros for the state
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
no no the matches for both you have to
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
it's cumulative so the and there's
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
different programs so the breakfast
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
program the food program the milk
 
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
program there's all separate programs
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
requirements but the match that's there
 
00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
by state lunch only applies to
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
lunch so that's matching the free lunch
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch 100% non Lun Federal parts
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
so that yeah so this was the amount that
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
was paid out for last year to match the
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we received for the
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
program that's why there's no um that's
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
why there's no 3 cents no 30 cents we
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
had to meet a match for the federal
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
funds that we we received and that's
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
what that comes from I understand that
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand which federal
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
dollars you're matching is it simply
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
matching the free lunch Federal plus the
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch Federal plus the 100% non
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
fnr lunch federal or is it a more
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
generalized match across this whole
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
thing it's it's cumulative across the
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
whole thing it's not specific to um
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
any meal that is being served the reason
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
why I I get that part but under the
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
breakfasts there is a specific
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
meal-based match correct right so is
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
this match also on top of that or is a
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
component of that so it's on top of it
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
and the the formula again that I could
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
get for you is that we have this dollar
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
amount we do take um meals that were
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
served in a certain month from that year
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then allocate that back to to the
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
schools so there is a Formula that is
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
done um I just wanted you to have a
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
total picture of when you looked at a
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
budget and you know we were only
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
allocating because we took to
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
consideration the RSA um that you would
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
look at your budget line of how much was
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
spent in this line I wanted you to see
 
00:24:24.389 --> 00:24:24.399 align:start position:0%
that we did in fact spend
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
800,000 um okay that's a good way to put
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
it in terms of the the lines so there's
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
a line in the budget for State lunch
 
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559 align:start position:0%
correct okay and there's also three
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
lines in the budget for breakfast as far
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
as the states
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
concerned the 51 million the 955 million
 
00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
the 60 million is that an accurate
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
statement yes it it is in um it's all in
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
one class but um it is allocated into
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
that yes so they go ahead no you you I
 
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
say just say you said again I'm sorry um
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
so it is allocated in the budget in one
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
class so it's class 601 is the breakfast
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
and then 602 um is where the lunch match
 
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
portion is in there in the budget okay
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh repr so when we look at the budget
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
we'd see the 832 for lunch in one line
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the 200 something for the breakfast
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
Consolidated in another line and this is
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
just the breakdown of how you got to
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
that Consolidated breakfast total
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
correct thank you and the very last
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
question on this topic because it's
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
already a lot if I yes you you may have
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
l that 8:32 is a match just for the
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
lunch programs correct regardless of the
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
nature of the meal but it's only for
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
lunch so the 200 is for the breakfast
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
800 something for lunch and that's how
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
we get to a million plus here that's
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
correct done thank you so that's great
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
when you do come back with the when we
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
start going through these things you
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
could call our attention to the lines
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
that you're referring to at that point
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you very
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
this chart is not broken down in as much
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
detail as the the other chart um but I
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
did want you to see the federal funding
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
that has um gone through the the office
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
um for fy22 23 and 24 and these are
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
based upon um the USDA programs um so
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
obviously in 22 that was during covid
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
you can see the um the dollar amount
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
that was pushed out for that um in FY 23
 
00:26:35.549 --> 00:26:35.559 align:start position:0%
there were um still some waivers um
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
during that time so you can see that the
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
the cost is still um higher and then
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
obviously in FY 24 um you know we've
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
dropped down on on federal funds for
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
that so are these programs strictly
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds these ones you have here
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
yes be with the exception of the
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
national school lunch program and that's
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
the one on page seven that has the
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
detail broken into it that has the state
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
portion um in there so that's why the
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's why page um seven was broken down
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
more um so that you can see the state
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
portion in there so so that's great but
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
it would have been nice to see you got
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
more years here would have been nice to
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
see the general funds across the years
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
as well that's okay I can do you don't
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
need to change anything but when you
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
come back okay uh yes representative
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
Dy why is it
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
72 million during Co the um USDA covered
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
all meals for all students so you didn't
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
have to have an income qualifier all
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
meals were covered all meals all meals
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
for all students very strange that it
 
00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:38.919 align:start position:0%
didn't matter anymore is it because the
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
children don't get the meals at home is
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
that probably part of the I I think they
 
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
had a very a number of reasons why they
 
00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
provided meals to to all students so
 
00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:50.919 align:start position:0%
that was for that school year covering
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
um it's going across because the fiscal
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
year is covering a couple of uh school
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
years because it's kind of right in the
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
middle so that's why an y 23 we're still
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
at almost 48 million because it was
 
00:28:04.269 --> 00:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
considering a portion of that school
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
year where those meals were still free
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
FY 24 is when we come back into really
 
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
enacting the law prior to
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
covid where there were the income
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
guidelines in place can I follow up um
 
00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
did this include delivering the meals to
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
the people at home the students at home
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
or did they have to come to the school
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
no they had to come to the schools to
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and just on on that that point as
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
well too um as Melissa stated in fy22
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
meals were reimbursed at the free rate
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
so that's why the the that's why the
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
federal funds is so high and as we go
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
back into um FY 23 and 24 the
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
applications need to be filled out and
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
the meals were then being um reimbursed
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the free reduced and paid rates that
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
you see in the um the previous
 
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
Pages um
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
so flipping to page nine to um this
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
through um 32 this oh okay um so this
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
report um is the the current um free and
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
reduced eligibility rates um for you at
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
thought it would be a good um document
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
for you to have this is also on our
 
00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:35.310 align:start position:0%
for you to have this is also on our
website

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so I won't go specifically through
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
that but um I thought it would be
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
helpful representa muray thank you just
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
a quick question do you see much
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
fluctuation um across you know within
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
the school district of students who
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
qualify or don't qualify is there a lot
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
of fluctuation or not between um fiscal
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
years or years when they yeah when
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
they're in the program when they're out
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
um I think that we we have seen
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
obviously coming from from covid to to
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
now that there there um you know it it
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
does depend on um if the the
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
applications are are getting filled out
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
at the local level um there number of
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
factors that that could come into play
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
on there um whether they receive
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
benefits through um a DHHS program snap
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
or tanif and and though they're directly
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
identified through those programs um so
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes there is a fluctuation um you know
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
depending upon um the the school
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
district or how many applications that
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
they have gone gotten
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
back just quick thank you um I guess
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for is if um you
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
potentially would see an uptick if uh a
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
rise of poverty um across the school
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
district um if that would show up in
 
00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159 align:start position:0%
here that's not what you're looking for
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious in terms of data that
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
this might be um another track or
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
another indication of of poverty in an
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
area I think there was a challenge
 
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
because um when there was no requirement
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
to fill out applications I know that was
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
reported um from school districts that
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
they were having difficulty getting um
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
families to go back to um filling those
 
00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
out so we've actually I think saw maybe
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
less so it's hard to to make a
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
correlation there
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
because it could have gone up but we
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to tell because there's
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
less applications being
 
00:31:28.639 --> 00:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
less applications being
F

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
F
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
out so this is a non-trivial thing to
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
search through isn't it it's not
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
by seu numbers it's not by alphabetical
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's just sort of throwing things
 
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.350 align:start position:0%
it's just sort of throwing things
together

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
alphabetical no I believe the the
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
district is in alphabetical order it's
 
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
coordinated by the school because that's
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
so so take a district like where you're
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
at John Stark and you got the the where
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
and then you but the but the SAU
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
includes um uh Stoddard and uh another
 
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
one hener and something else I think yes
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
what do you call
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
that but it would be listed by school
 
00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
name of school I hener Community School
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
no no name of school and where uh hker
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
Community School uh in Haner Center
 
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.389 align:start position:0%
Community School uh in Haner Center
Woods

00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
Woods
 
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
Elementary okay and how about the one
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's where Middle School midd school
 
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
you think that's in here it should be at
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
the W's
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
Maybe is that supposed to be the end or
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
is it could have be somewhere
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%

00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
winnisquam we can also get this report
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
for you in Excel if that's helpful oh
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
that'd be great um you somebody must
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
have told you what I like that'd be
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
fantastic if you everything you can get
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes page 27 where District
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
office yeah I think we have it actually
 
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
organized by
 
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:21.350 align:start position:0%
organized by
uh

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
it'll say the district
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:46.470 align:start position:0%

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
15 I will send this to you in Excel so
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
you can sort sort As You Wish um so um
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
if there's no question further questions
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
on that um flipping to page
 
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
33 um I thought that this again might
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
just be um a helpful one-page document
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
for you um all to just have a little bit
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
more information on the community
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
eligibility um program um also known as
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
c um because I know there have been some
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
um some questions about about that
 
00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
um some questions about about that
program

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
um and then flipping to um page 34 again
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
again just for
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
oh were you done with that page yes but
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
if you have a question
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
I I'm
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
not maybe just a little more detail so
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
what is that as respect everything else
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
sure um so I apologize I this is my I
 
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
have to admit most of these folks are
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
not new to the committee except for
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
myself and representative Kelly and
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
representative Roy so sure I'll be happy
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
to to speak about um c a little bit more
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
so um the community eligibility
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
provision program um we currently have
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
three schools in New Hampshire on this
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
program and it takes your um directly
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
identified students and uses that
 
00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
percentage um and takes it to then be
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
able to offer um meals to students at a
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
certain percentage paid by the federal
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
government and then the other portion
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be paid by non-federal funds um
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
and I thought it was to put this in here
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
um I know there's been some conversation
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
about C in the community eligibility
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
program um and so they the calculation
 
00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
percentage is um or the calculations
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
formula excuse me um is on here um it
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
also goes into detail on what the
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
identified students what who those
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
entail um and the um percentage to
 
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
qualify um was recently reduced to 25%
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
from 40%
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
um and so that would mean that um
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
schools that have 25% or higher are
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate in this program
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
there is another um application process
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
that we go through for verification of
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
that um but that's what that means for
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
for that program and does this interact
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
with the other programs or are they
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
independent what's the relationship you
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
so you would need to be on the national
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
school lunch program in order to qualify
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
for um for eligibility for this program
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
and this program then
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
provides more than those programs nope
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
so um so this program would provide a
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
additional subsidy federal subsidy um
 
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
for additional meals at no cost for for
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage of your students um
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
but the other side of of this program is
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
that then um the the the students are
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
not actually paying for the meal but the
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
meal um needs to be paid for by somebody
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
so um who who is that so is that um you
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
know coming from from the taxpayers or
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
um for that District or it does need to
 
00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
be paid with non-federal funds so let's
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
take for example you had uh a community
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
that said okay we want to participate in
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
C they go in they identify maybe 40% of
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
their population would qualify so 40%
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
the other 60% would need to be covered
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
by the school or the Local District so
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to offer 100% free meals
 
00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
to everybody 60% or 40% I'm sorry would
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
come from the feds the other 60% would
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
then be paid for at the local level so
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
the IDE is to cover everybody as opposed
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
to just a correct so the kids all get
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
the free meals you have to give everyone
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
a free meal but you have to make sure
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
then that you have some sort of way to
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
identify your percentage of poverty so
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
this gets a little bit different because
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
you can't cannot use the free and
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
reduced applications so there has to be
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
some other way to qualify and identify
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
those students so what we found is by
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
dropping it to
 
00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
25% to
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
qualify can be a challenge if the local
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
level cannot cover the 75% cost of the
 
00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
meals so it can be you know it works
 
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
very well I think for um communities
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
that have a very high percentage o of
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
poverty so if you're looking at 85% of
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
your community um qualifies and then the
 
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
local levels only having to cover maybe
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
15% it that program works out incredibly
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
well for those communities because then
 
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
and those families don't you know have
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
to to qualify for those reduced kids
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
that might go in and out between you
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
know that qualifying number but when
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking at you know a community
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
that maybe only has 25% the local level
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
having to cover 75% can be a cost that
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
they need to make you know a decision at
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
at the local level as to whether they
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
can cover that or nots on
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
papish thank you Mr chair given what
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying which by the way makes
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely complete sense right the
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
higher the percentage the more
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
worthwhile the CP is because you have
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
more kids that benefit fewers you got to
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
carry for and you reduce the paperwork
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
by massive amount if it's a large number
 
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.030 align:start position:0%
by massive amount if it's a large number
of

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
kids when the barrier for eligibility
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
was reduced from 40 to 25 did you see
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
any districts who are in the 25 to 40
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
range actually join the program yet no
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
no no we did thank you I thought so um
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
because although it does that it does
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
lower the um the percentage for
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
qualifying the multiplier they did not
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
change that number so um then as Melissa
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
stated there would be more um cost for
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
the the local level on that with the the
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
lower um
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
percentage and I think right now they're
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
looking at upping the percentage because
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
when they dropped it to 25 I think the
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
current administration's looking at to
 
00:39:52.589 --> 00:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
upping that back to I think they were
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
saying 60% yes
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
so you know was the intent do you know
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
what the intent of the program
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
was I I believe just as as you stated to
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
to lessen the burden of filling out the
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
applications um because once you're on
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
this program you'd be on it for five
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
years so you'd have that um identified
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
percentage for five years there is the
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
capability that you could reapply every
 
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
single year and then you would start
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
your five years over again um but the
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the program was you know just
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
that to limit the the burden of you know
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
the applications and then to be able to
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
provide um meals at no cost to the to
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
helps um and then the last page um again
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
is just for your reference on the the
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
poverty um guidelines that we are um
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:08.079 align:start position:0%
representative muray uh yeah just
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
curious can you define how they define
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
Household here because I see it goes up
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
to 14 uh which a whole lot of kids but
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
is there you know a household um a
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
legitimate defined household in terms of
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
grandparents or in-laws or auns and
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
justify I would need to get that
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
information for
 
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
you now it's a good
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
question yeah one other thing um there's
 
00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599 align:start position:0%
a lot less well maybe not a lot there
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
seems to be less paperwork on your
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
shoulders now than there used to be that
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
some of that has been
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
streamlined are you is there a way or do
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
you what would you like to see happen in
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
terms of making it easier for you to
 
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
identify these children and doing you
 
00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
know doing right by these kids in terms
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
of all the paperwork and stuff you have
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
to do well I think that the feds the
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
federal programs require an application
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
to be filled out so we're we're all
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
required to provide a paper applications
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
so that that part of it cannot change um
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
and then the switching to you know you
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
can offer an online application but
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
again that's a cost at the local level
 
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
to have to develop those online
 
00:42:23.069 --> 00:42:23.079 align:start position:0%
applications so um I think that when
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's a cost that has to be Cur at
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
incurred at the local level that's got
 
00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
to be a local level Det determination
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
Wester whether they want to pursue that
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
or not so there's not a lot we could do
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
to help you there sounds like I think
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
that would be more of a question maybe
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
level thank
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
before go ahead just a quick question
 
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
Melissa could you repeat your last name
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
we couldn't I didn't write it down fast
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
enough I apolog I'm sorry Melissa white
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
Rambo oh good for you everybody else
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
that up
 
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
here okay please introduce yourselves
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
and carry on uh just want to cover a
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
topic that um members that have been
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
division 2 for uh have heard these
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
conversations before um as you know the
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
nutrition program is a program about
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for meals and it's about the
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
nutrition aspect of it you also know
 
00:43:58.829 --> 00:43:58.839 align:start position:0%
members have been on this committee f&amp;r
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
data impacts adequacy funding and so
 
00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
anytime you dive into that policy area
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
and you're impacting potentially
 
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
applications or fnr student counts in
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
any way you're going to impact the
 
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy side of it so um uh if you have
 
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
any sort of uh the only thing I can sort
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
of advise you on is think about how any
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
program policy changes you make might
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
impact our ability to count either under
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
count or uh not overcount but um uh
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
potentially count those fnr students so
 
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
um local policy makers also make those
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
decisions they think about potentially
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
offering um Universal meals um and then
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
we have to remind them that you might
 
00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
have a hard time getting them to fill
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
out the form if you've already agreed to
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
pay for it without a form so that's a
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
local decision that local districts make
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
and some of them look at the adequacy
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
numbers and they look at the the they
 
00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:50.839 align:start position:0%
crunch the numbers and it would be
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
better for them to get them to fill out
 
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
the form so they can get more adequacy
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
funding um so those are local polic
 
00:44:59.470 --> 00:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
policy decisions that locals make um you
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
also as a from the state level need to
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
or need to keep that in mind as you as
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
you look at this area that it impacts
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy so just wanted to remind you of
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
you and I can answer I think there were
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that came up
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
regarding uh Career and Technical
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
education programs um they decided they
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
separ oh okay that sounds good yeah we
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
decid sorry I that we decided that on
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
Monday that we'll actually have Jeff
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
come and do a like full presentation
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
sounds seem like they have a lot of
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions perfect there was one followup
 
00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:46.559 align:start position:0%
question I and that was the question I
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
was um available to answer so um I think
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
there was a question regarding how much
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
goes to the community college system of
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
the federal Perkins funds so the
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
department of education our allocation
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
comes in at about just under 7 million
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
so we've get about 6.9 million to um
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
administer the through Perkins to
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
administer our Career and Technical
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
education programs and of that about 1.2
 
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559 align:start position:0%
million goes to the Community College
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
systems the Community College systems
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
then divides that up could you could you
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
back up sure so first of all you started
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
talking about what was the name of the
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
program the Career and Technical
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
education I got that part okay the other
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
name you use Perkins and what is a
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
Federal grant program that's just the
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
name of the act that provides the funds
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
to all
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
states for that program and what is that
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
program about for what purpose it's for
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
um developing Career and Technical
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
education programs in in the US okay so
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
not not portion of that so we get about
 
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.589 align:start position:0%
not not portion of that so we get about
6.9

00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
6.9
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
million just under 7 million to
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
administer that
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
program of those funds about 1.2 million
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
is then distributed to the community
 
00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.750 align:start position:0%
is then distributed to the community
college

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
system and the community college system
 
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
then takes that 1.2 million and they
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
divide it among their seven uh community
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
college system colleges and I think the
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
amount when we went in and did an
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
analysis is given to each of those seven
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
is about equal and it covers um the pel
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
grants recipients so
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
so there questions those are the pel
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
grants yes or it goes to the pel grant
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
recipients so on top of their pel grants
 
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
um it might be part of it I'm not
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
exactly sure I think that'd be a
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
question for the community it's on top
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
of okay on top of it okay and what what
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
happens to the other 5.7 million of that
 
00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
Perkins thing so there's a a small
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
percentage that goes for administration
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
of the funds there's a small percentage
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
that's for set aside for State programs
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we might initiate at the state
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
level and then then we have um the rest
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
that goes out to the
 
00:48:02.109 --> 00:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
schools to the public schools yes
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
correct just distributed to oh no not to
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
the public schools it goes to our
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
regional Career and Technical Education
 
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
Centers to the Regionals yes
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
okay so at a later date we'll have Jeff
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
beard and who's the administrator of the
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
special education program and he will
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
bring the town Bytown allocations um
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
he'll talk about the state career and
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
Tech education funding program as well
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
as the um
 
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
um the capital project programs that are
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
for career and tech ed so that's we just
 
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
didn't think we had room to do it today
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
because it's a pretty big topic so
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
career and tech ed is basically High
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
School yes and it's some a little bit at
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
the college level as well the community
 
00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.430 align:start position:0%
the college level as well the community
college

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
level well I get that but when you say
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
that 1.2 million goes to ccsnh you're
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
treating that part is in up separate
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
correct the part that you said the
 
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
remainder is basically High School
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
correct yes or no yes well it it stems
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
through you can use some of the funds to
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
Target Middle School participation to
 
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
increase so I mean it can be used middle
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
to high school and we do maybe a little
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
bit of to promote the education at the
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
middle school level but yes you're high
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
school it is High School Middle sign I
 
00:49:16.789 --> 00:49:16.799 align:start position:0%
can work with middle but not high school
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to switch topics
 
00:49:33.309 --> 00:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to do state special
 
00:49:33.319 --> 00:49:34.510 align:start position:0%
we're going to do state special
education

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
funding um so I'm Caitlyn I was here the
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
other day um I will be discussing the
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
model and the formula aspects of this
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
but if you have questions specific to
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
special education programming um Melissa
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
is going to provide that support to the
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
committee she oversees the instructional
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
portion of the program um and some of
 
00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
the formula distribution and then I work
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
on the data and the funding side of it
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
with my team so it's a kind of a split
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
project between the the two divisions um
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
so for those of you that um were at the
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education orientation day
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago you'll remember um
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
Rebecca fet who's the state
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
administrator of the special education
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
Bureau went through um how special
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
education in the seity of New Hampshire
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
works the different you know the
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
different types of programming the
 
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
approvals for the special education um
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
schools and she talked about you know
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
the different Revenue sources with this
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
the state federal um and other Federal
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
sources there is one state special
 
00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
education program um specifically
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
special education funding program that's
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund that has
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
been in the newspapers quite a bit
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
lately um because it uh there was a
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
shortfall in funding in the state budget
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
this year so that's the part we're going
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about today so it's called state
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
educ state special education funding um
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
it was previously known as catastrophic
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
Aid um those of us who've been doing
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
this for a long time have a tough time
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
not calling it that still so if you ever
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
hear me call CAD Aid this is what I'm
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
referring to um it was previously
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
General funded um however two budget
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
sessions ago I believe it was moved into
 
00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund um I think by
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
this committee um and that's where it's
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
remained um so the way it works is the
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education determine it
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation in our budget remember
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
typically when the Department of
 
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
Education is doing a budget we two years
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
out from the budget act actually
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
happening so the budget that you're
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
working in 26 the most recent
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
information that we had was school year
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
23's information so we're working a
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
couple years behind so a lot of people
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
are asking us kind of how that shortfall
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
ended up happening in this year's budget
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
well when and I'll go through this it's
 
00:51:41.309 --> 00:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
in the packet but when we were working
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
on the budget two years ago that was the
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
number that we felt would be sufficient
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
to fully fund this uh
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
obligation so in your packet if you want
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
to go to one the pages labeled three out
 
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
of six I do have a visual but I'm going
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
to actually talk about and you can
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
ignore the visual if you're more of a
 
00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
visual person but I'm going to talk
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
about the cost allocation sample so the
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
way this
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
funding which document are you looking
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
document oh oh
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
wait yeah that one it's showing up
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
online it's just the front page on oh
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay well no online Mickey
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
well I don't do you yeah do you have
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
another copy
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
Mickey yeah maybe we just sent him the
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
one page yeah do you have a copy of it
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
no I don't okay well we have extra
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
copies thank you there's more over there
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
too M sorry about that that's okay it's
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
the downside of having a computer I
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
guess we're trying you're doing great
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing great all right so there's
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
a formula the formula is in state law
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
it's rsa1 86c um it's embedded in the in
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
total special education law in New
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and the funding formula is
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
to help support local public school
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
districts with costs associated with
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
children that are high cost meaning
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
higher than three and a half times the
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
average cost per pupil in the state of
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um so that the three and a
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
half times the average three and a half
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
times is determined by the office of
 
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
school finance and we publish that
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
number we do an estimate for the purpose
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
of um this formula and then we provide
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
that information to schools and schools
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
then go throughout a year and C up the
 
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
costs associated with a child and if a
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
child may have costs that exceed that
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
three and a half times amount at the end
 
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
of the school year they submit to the
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for
 
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement through this formula um so
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
what happens is it's a pretty manual
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
process but we have a team of people in
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of special education who take
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
in all of the invoices associated with
 
00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
these children's IEPs the individual
 
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
education program program or plan
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
program program um IND education program
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
and then um we look at all of the
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
invoices we ensure that the invoices
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
support it support various different
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
services that are needed to be required
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
as part of the IEP and that it's all
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
allowable and and appropriate for the
 
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
kids disability as determined by the
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
local school district and then we
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
determine amount of those inv ches
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's allowable to figure out what the
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education might
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
potentially owe for that kid so once
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
we've done that that that's kind of big
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
part part of the work so we assume let's
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
for the example that's on the left side
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
of so we assume that the kids allowable
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
costs are
 
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
$150,000 so they might have additional
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
costs but they may have not been
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
allowable or for whatever reason um just
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
not included so the $150,000 of
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
allowable costs 3 and half times the
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
average cost per pupil last year was
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
69,6 so if you look down here so the
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
first thing that we do is the
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
69,6 that is the school district's
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
liability for the school district so
 
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
they have to cover everything up to
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
three and a half times after three and a
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
half times the formula that's in state
 
00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
law says that the state will pay 80% of
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
the amount above three and a half
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
times and then um so the we what we do
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
so we take all of the kids we figure out
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
all that 80% for the entire State and we
 
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
add it up and we figure out what the
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
total amount that we would need to pay
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
is and then we figure out what we have
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
for appropriation and we then will'll
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
prate it as needed so um there's a lot
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
of confusion a lot of times around this
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
that the 80% of the pration just becomes
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
or sorry the 80% just becomes a lower
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
amount but we're actually paying 80 or
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
sorry this year it was 60% so 68% so we
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
pay 68% of the 80% of the cap of the
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
amount that exceed the cap so you can
 
00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
kind of see here the way the spreadsheet
 
00:56:09.069 --> 00:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
works is so the total District
 
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
entitlement from the state of New
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for this $150,000 kid at the
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
top was
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
$64,000 um and the state of New
 
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's um amount was
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
$44,000 so the total amount for the kid
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
is the state paid $44,000 and the state
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
paid $150,000 for the
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
kid so that's a kid that is just regular
 
00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.950 align:start position:0%
kid so that's a kid that is just regular
um

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
between so there's there's once you get
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
over 3 and half% it's fixed is not
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
another there's not another break point
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
there is another break point um that's
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
with the second example that you have on
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
your page um but just need to make sure
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
you understand the first one first
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
because it gets a little bit more
 
00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
complicated so once you get over the 80%
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
or sorry once you hit over the three and
 
00:56:59.309 --> 00:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
a half times and they get up to 10 times
 
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
then you're eligible for 100% of those
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
costs that exceed 10 times so the
 
00:57:06.029 --> 00:57:06.039 align:start position:0%
example on the second part of your page
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
is a student that's cost $300,000 or had
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
expenses of
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
$300,000 so the first part of that we do
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
is the three and a half times or sorry
 
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
the three and a half times is the
 
00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
$70,000 so we take that $70,000 out and
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
then the amount from 3 and 1/2 to 10
 
00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:26.039 align:start position:0%
times is 80% reimbursable and the amount
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
that exceeds 10 times is 100%
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursable from the state then that
 
00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
total amount is then PR rated and these
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
are the areas that there's a lot of
 
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
confusion because people kind of over
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
the years think that oh well then this's
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
paying 100% of that and 80% of that
 
00:57:45.789 --> 00:57:45.799 align:start position:0%
which then you know the 80% is decreased
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
to the 60% and we're still paying 100%
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
but no what we do is we figure out the
 
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
total States required amount for that
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
kid and then prate that amount in total
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
so um and I do want to kind of point out
 
00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
this is State special education funding
 
00:58:05.549 --> 00:58:05.559 align:start position:0%
like this line item that's in the state
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
budget only there are some other special
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
education funding um that could come
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
into play here that school districts are
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
receiving for kids but not child
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
specific funding to help with these
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
specific costs so remember there was I
 
00:58:21.309 --> 00:58:21.319 align:start position:0%
think it's like 67 million in adequacy
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
that's differentiated aid for adequacy
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's different from this there's also
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
Federal DEA formula funds um that school
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
districts receive and then some of these
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh kids are Medicaid eligible as well so
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
school school districts have a program
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
that they access through HHS called
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools and can re get
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for some of this but for
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
this alone this is the way this formula
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
works so the next page that's in your
 
00:58:51.069 --> 00:58:51.079 align:start position:0%
packet rep ha and Phillips um I'm just a
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
little con uh confused about how the
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
pration works um all the other
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
explanation made complete sense to me
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little caught up about
 
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
um maybe you just walk through if you
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
could like the process of creating like
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
determining what the pration is maybe
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
that will make so actually the next page
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
is we can to help you do that so the
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
next page is the history of uh State
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
special education cadid um so we have
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
back you can see going back to 2007 um
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
we have the data this this program has
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
actually been around for a very long
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
time this is the slide that we have that
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
we've been using it so it's 200 7 so the
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
very first line it says paid in January
 
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
25 so that's the money we just paid
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
related to last school year so it's
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
always it's again like adequacy it's
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
paid in one year in a rares because the
 
00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:39.799 align:start position:0%
school districts have to go through the
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
complete costs of a kid send it to us
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
over the summer we do that review I
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned um and so the total of all of
 
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
the kids submitted the total allowable
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
cost submitted to the Department of
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
Education this year was 1119 million so
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
those are the allow able cost so on the
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
on the last page we talked about the two
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
the 150 and the 300 bucket that's that
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
now once the department of education's
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
done its review it's taken the cap and
 
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
it's taken the 80% and anything that out
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
it comes down to 49 million so 49 is the
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
amount the state in theory would have to
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
pay if there was not a pration provision
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
but because when I T started out I said
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
remember we worked on these numbers
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
several years ago so when we were in the
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
summer of
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
22 we had when we were working on the
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
last state budget we had um that January
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
22 payment we had just made we said all
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
right well our appropriation was $31
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
million it was sufficient to make our
 
01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
entire payment we said all right well
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
let's use 33 for 24 and 25 because that
 
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
seems like it should be sufficient based
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
on the way that history has um kind of
 
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799 align:start position:0%
come out as far as the funding and so we
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
use that number for our budget and then
 
01:00:58.990 --> 01:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
here we are in 25 where we had school
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
districts request $49 million and only
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
we only had $33 million of appropriation
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
and so that's how we come up with that
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
pration amount and you can see the
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
historical Trends over the years so um
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
this year 69% last year 87% 98% 100 and
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
100 um and you can see you know the
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
funds were relatively high they were
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
around $30 million back in 20072 2008 um
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
and then there were some pretty big cuts
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
around the big financial crisis in the
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
mid 2000s and the funding has been
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
appropriated at higher amounts over the
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
last several years um but we are still
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
in an area again what we will be we are
 
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
so go ahead thanks um I'm just wondering
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
what does this mean in practicality for
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of the local District's budget
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
planning process so um do you identify
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
the proportion of the pration amount in
 
01:01:59.549 --> 01:01:59.559 align:start position:0%
real time so that they can plan their
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
budget process or does that number get
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
released after the budgets are set so
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's released after the budgets are set
 
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
because the budgets are set in the
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah so we give them an estimate on
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
October 1st um of all the different
 
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
state revenues and so we have the
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
different state revenues we tell them
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
what adequacy is going to be and what we
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
anticipate this amount would be um and
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
forward represent papovich thank you Mr
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
chair and again thank you for taking
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
questions um you were talking about how
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
you forecast the amount and uh this
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
seems to be a significant increase and
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
not necessarily following the past
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
Trends does the department get any
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
insight into what caused this
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
significant increase in special
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for the question so it I
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
mean it definitely fluctuates throughout
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
the year so you can see like you know
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're coming in PID January of 2010
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at 95 million I mean it
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
the there's fluctuations throughout it
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
goes down it goes up um I think there's
 
01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.829 align:start position:0%
goes down it goes up um I think there's
also

01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
um you know some questions about whether
 
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
the pandemic the increase in just cost
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
in general for all things I mean if we
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
look at groceries everything has gone up
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
um I mean that could definitely come
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
into play but as you can see I mean the
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
numbers of students or the student count
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
that that's gone up it's gone down so
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's really difficult to determine if
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's you know the services that have
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
gone up that are more costly if it's
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
just a
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
fluctuation follow up yeah just go on
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate it and I know
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's tough because you only have so much
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
data so the other question I'm sure
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
you've heard it from me the past but not
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
committee when you determine that you
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
know a funding uh invoice is uh you know
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
approved by you guys you are just
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the nature of the service and
 
01:04:12.029 --> 01:04:12.039 align:start position:0%
in whether it's appropriate for the kid
 
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
or do you also consider whether the cost
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
charge for that particular invoice is
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable in view of you know State
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
costs or whatever other benchmarks you
 
01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
may have we do not evaluate that part of
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
it but we do look to see if the services
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
are in the students IEP so if they're
 
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
billing us for services that are not in
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
the students IEP those would not be an
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
allowable cost so we go and look at the
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
students IEP if the services are in the
 
01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
IEP then they can um submit invoices on
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
um behalf of that I think it's also
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
worth mentioning that the co relief
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
funds there was a significant amount of
 
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
coming of funding coming into the
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
schools with Co relief funds special
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
education also received a separate
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
allocation and so idea there was a
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
portion carved out of the elementary and
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
secondary education Relief act that
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
provided funds specifically for students
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
with disabilities and so what we're
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
seeing is that last year was kind of a a
 
01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
not not a cliff but a little bit of that
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
so that they had a lot of funding to
 
01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
maybe support some of those more acute
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
issues and then that funding did go down
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
because the funds
 
01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
ended one one additional thing so many
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
of these kids are in and out of District
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
placement mean they're not receiving
 
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
their services specifically speically in
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
their school district if they're in a
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nonpublic school um that
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
has been approved for providing special
 
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
education services we do have a rate
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
setting process so those schools can't
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
charge more than those rates being
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
allowed by the Department of Education
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
but the Department of Education doesn't
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
have rate setting in the same way that
 
01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid might HHS for specific OT
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
services that a school district can
 
01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
charge thank you and I'm assuming that
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
you have the same limitations when you
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
deal with kids placed out of state that
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
we have no real authority over out of
 
01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
state placements so it is what it is and
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
the last question on this
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
topic I know that it's very hard to
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
compare apples with apples when you talk
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
about special education services because
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
every kid's needs are very different but
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure in certain categories you may
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
be able to just look at the broad range
 
01:06:19.269 --> 01:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
of prices charged across the state for
 
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
what appear to be similar services do
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
you guys have the authority or the
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
resources needed to look at that to
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
determine whether you know we may have a
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
need to uh verify that charges are
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable thank you for the question I
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
do really appreciate that the state
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
contributes a very small amount to the
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to to for our
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and so if you look
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
at special education most of our
 
01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:48.559 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are covered by Ida
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
the federal funding so I am able to pay
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
for 25% of a position so 0.25 of an te
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
for special education and then I able to
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
have some temporary positions to do the
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
special education Aid invoice review so
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
I bring in temporary staff to come in
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
and do the processing of the invoices
 
01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
because I don't have the ability to fund
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
staff to do that so I would say that
 
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
what the state actually contributes to
 
01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.430 align:start position:0%
what the state actually contributes to
special

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
special
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
education um Administration there there
 
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
is a disparity there because we don't
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
have the resources to be able to go in
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
and do a lot of of the data analysis I
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff to go in and do
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
invoice analysis all of the staff that I
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
do have for special education has to be
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
deployed to meeting the federal
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
requirements Federal data going in and
 
01:07:38.069 --> 01:07:38.079 align:start position:0%
doing those type of monitoring process
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
so it does make it a little bit
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to bring somebody in to do
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
that that level of detail I appreciate
 
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
the question repres Murray thank you I'm
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
not sure if I'm thinking of the right
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
program but last year we had a lot of
 
01:07:51.309 --> 01:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
discussion and I think the bill passed
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
about different levels of need so there
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
was you know um someone the lisp as
 
01:07:57.549 --> 01:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
opposed to someone who's a quadriplegic
 
01:07:58.589 --> 01:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
and the different so do you know what
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm referring to and does that
 
01:08:01.789 --> 01:08:01.799 align:start position:0%
pertain to this or is that am I
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
confusing with another program it didn't
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
get through the Senate no it didn't and
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
it makes it a bit difficult because if
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
the state is to then base funding on
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
levels of students disabilities or
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
determinations we have to undergo a
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
pretty a pretty significant monitoring
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
of that system and we'd have to bring in
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
additional staff just to be able to do
 
01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
that so the federal program if they see
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
States enacting that type of legislation
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
then they come in and say okay you've
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
got to go in and do double duty
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
analyzing and going in and monitoring to
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
make sure that those students are not
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
Mis appropriately being identified to
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
then qualify for some of those those
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
funding sources so it's actually better
 
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
for you that it did not
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
pass I I take uh I I stay neutral on
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
though two questions related to what you
 
01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
were discussing with representative
 
01:08:54.199 --> 01:08:55.709 align:start position:0%
were discussing with representative
papovich

01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
papovich
 
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
so Staffing if you had more staff you
 
01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:00.759 align:start position:0%
could do a better job of determination
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
which actually might impact the costs or
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
maybe quality of staff that could then
 
01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
you know a position that could a datea
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
an analyst that could go in and maybe
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
look a little bit more closely and do a
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
deeper dive into the types of of
 
01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
services and maybe
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
also cross referencing that with other
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
states even states around us to look at
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
those Services when we look at placing a
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
student a New Hampshire student in an
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
out of distri placement out of state
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
that's where costs can tend to be
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
compounded so you know being you know I
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
can take a look at that but I need to
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
have somebody to be able to go in and
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
maybe do a deeper dive so given that
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
we're trying to reduce or eliminate
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
those just go back to the the non out
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
ofate placements could you have an
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
impact that actually might
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
reduce the costs or would it just give
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
us analysis of where the costs are
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
occurring I think it would give us the
 
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
both maybe being able to look at you
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
know where those costs are maybe
 
01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
comparison of what it looks like in
 
01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
State versus out of state um maybe
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
across the state maybe we're looking at
 
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
rule I I mean I could think of a many
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
variables like maybe rule services are a
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more but I I can't give you
 
01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
anything concrete because we don't have
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
the data is that like a person or like a
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
couple I mean how many when you say you
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
need people how many people would you
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
need I mean it could be done in a
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
variety of ways we could look at people
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
but we could also look at Contracting
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
the services out
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
how much money would you need you don't
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
need to give me an answer but maybe you
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
think about that thank you um and the
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
other side of things um regarding it
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
sounds like you don't hear any of this
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
news until after the school year closes
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
and then oh here they all are as opposed
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
to somebody recognizing that we've hit
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
75 what whatever the magic number is you
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
know in U October and uh basically let
 
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
giving you a heads up that across the
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
state that things are starting to happen
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
um before you get to you know June 30th
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever so I was the way the
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
legislation is written we just have to
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
follow it the timeline that it's laid
 
01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
out so it is so this is I mean this is
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually something that I was asked
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
recently too and I think the difficulty
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
with this program is we are only talking
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
about 800 kids across the state so a
 
01:11:13.070 --> 01:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
district might have one kid or two kids
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
that they haven't had in the past or no
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
kids but it's not necessarily something
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing you know 30 40 50%
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
increase across the state because even
 
01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
though this is a a lot of money it
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
spread across the entire State there is
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
really no kind of red flags that were
 
01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
going off on you know any Flags but now
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
does maybe one or two District say well
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
I think my special education costs are
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
higher than normal that potentially
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
could have been a conversation that's
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
had but it's not been something that's
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
been brought to the
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
department okay I think you
 
01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstood my question so I'm
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
thinking of per student because this is
 
01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
all per student right everything here so
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
if the district is tracking this per
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
student spending m MH they can they know
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
when it's going to hit that first
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
threshold whatever that was and right at
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
that point they could let you know oh we
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
have a student that's this is going to
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
be a student that's there going to be an
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
issue at at some level and could be
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
giving you tracking information from
 
01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
that point forward and especially what
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
happened in October you could start
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
getting you start have an idea that
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
across the state now you're all doing
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
this I mean these things just don't all
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
pop up on last day of June these
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
expenses I mean I would
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps the tracking it really does not
 
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
become apparent for many of them until
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
more towards the end of the
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
year that's a problem so well two things
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
before I forget you mentioned
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislation affects something so please
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
let me know what that legislation is so
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
I can understand what that is so if it
 
01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be undone we can undo it um you
 
01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
I think you indicated that with regard
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
to this tracking stuff um in terms of
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
timing but but but to the issue if our
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
local districts are waiting until the
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
end of June and now going okay we got
 
01:12:58.350 --> 01:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
one or two kids whatever let's you know
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
we all pieces of
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
paper that's bad accounting I mean they
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
should be accounting for this through
 
01:13:05.229 --> 01:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
the entire year wouldn't you well I
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
won't ask if you agree that's an opinion
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
that'd be my opinion so um might it make
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
a difference if you saw what this was
 
01:13:14.669 --> 01:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
coming sooner so depending on what your
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
scheduling is looking like for D2
 
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
because we know March gets very busy
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
very quickly but when we're looking at
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
some of these programs especially if
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
you're considering making a decision
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
that might impact the funding I would
 
01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
recommend that we have one or two
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
business administrators or special
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
education administrators from a school
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
district to kind of come in and talk
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
about this um those of you that were on
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
D2 last time know there was a lot of
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
conversations about building Aid and so
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
we did have some build some business
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
administrators from schools come in so I
 
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
think that might help the committee um
 
01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
understand how this is implemented
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
locally and help your decision-making
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
process and we can facilitate that but
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
it's just you know will you have the
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
time to do that is that's a question
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
okay well Mick will put that down and
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
did you say business administrators I
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
hope not special education no business
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
administrators and special education
 
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
administrators it varies it does vary by
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
school who kind of has this function
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's much more on the special
 
01:14:05.550 --> 01:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
education side of things some times it's
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
much so it depends on skill set and
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
school district and resources and
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
whatnot so we but we can we can
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
determine that on our side of things and
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
I will say some of the the the programs
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
that submit invoices and some of the
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
providers that are submitting invoices I
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
mean they're not always timely either so
 
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
it's not as if it's completely the
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility and I think that's a good
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion to bring in some business
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
administrators to give some perspective
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
because sometimes we do see even for
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
some of our court order placements and
 
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
episodes of treatment they they're
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
submitting their billing maybe not on a
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
timely manner as well so it it it gets
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
compounded because it's a process where
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
the invoices go from the provider to the
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
district the district then pays it and
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
because it's all on a reimbursement
 
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
basis then we're going back and and
 
01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
doing the review I do understand those
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
kind of lags but if they're not filing
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
at least quarterly you might just say
 
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get paid um there's
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of things you can do to solve that
 
01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
problem representing papovich I think
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
well just to your point so there's
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
another program there's another program
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
that it's called 402 court ordered
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
placements and they do file quarterly on
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
that actually up to monthly but because
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the nature of that program so that n
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
that program is paid in full no matter
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
what so as soon as they can start
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
getting the revenue flowing they do they
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
start submitting those invoices but
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
because this program has to be prated
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
across the entire State all of the
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
schools submit everything at one time
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
because we can't we have to have 100% of
 
01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
everything processed before we can
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
determine what district is um eligible
 
01:15:32.189 --> 01:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
for what funds so totally understand
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
that um I guess the way I'm looking at
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
this is if you had an
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
idea say in January or February that
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an issue just keep
 
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
in mind especially the second year of
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
the budget if we happen to have good
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
years like we have had in the past we
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
could say oh we need to well I do also
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
want to remind you what Melissa had just
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
said is that she has part-time seasonal
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
employees that do this work so those
 
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
people are not at the Department of
 
01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
Education in January or February they
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
come in in August to start doing this
 
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
that's why I ask about the Staffing as
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
well this is It's a complicated process
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
and I think it's good we're having these
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
conversations okay re po thank you and
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh basically my question is just to wrap
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
up this uh
 
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
conversation in an Ideal World if the
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
schools were able to feed you this data
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
through the year you know once somebody
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
reaches the threshold they start telling
 
01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
you hey we are getting there would that
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
make a difference to you in terms of
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
being able to address the funding or you
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
would just see the big boulder coming
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
earlier but still be in the
 
01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
way I
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
mean we could certainly if we had more
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
realtime reporting keep the legislature
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
more updated on it um that would that's
 
01:16:40.990 --> 01:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
something I think just that alone would
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
would go a long way um but as far as
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
addressing you know are the costs too
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
high we would need I think additional
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
authorities and and whatnot understood
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
but I was just thinking right now about
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
that 68% that we are at because I don't
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
think the legislature is uh you know
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
excited about that low percentage right
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
and we understand the nature of the
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
forecast and the unusual spike in cause
 
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
that made this happen right but the
 
01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
question was really if if we would see
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
this coming earlier would that give us
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
more time between the Department of
 
01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
Education and the legislature or fiscal
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
or wherever else where we may need to
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
maybe address this rather than you know
 
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
find about it months later after
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
everybody's rates are set and create a
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
lot of uncertainty in the process and I
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
think the answer is possibly yes right
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
but it's not a definite answer right now
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I think ABS I think what you're
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
saying is yes absolutely we just need to
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
think about how the system would work to
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
do that it's complicated nobody's saying
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
you Kelly thank you may maybe you've
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
already explained this because I'm
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
trying to process all this information
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
um your last column probation amount it
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
really fluctuates a lot is that part of
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
yes the probation amount is really just
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
dependent on um what is appropriated
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
versus what the total expenses that come
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
in it so um and I I want to remind you
 
01:18:15.950 --> 01:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
all in this room is we're very
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
frequently told to do level funded
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
budgets which means all right well we
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
had 33 million last year and that was
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
sufficient we're going to put $33
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
million in this year so Department kind
 
01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
of sticks to the mentality the
 
01:18:29.590 --> 01:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
legislature has been relatively generous
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
as far as this account and appropriating
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
additional funds in this account over
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
the the last several years but clearly
 
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
the expenses have increased faster than
 
01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:39.149 align:start position:0%
the expenses have increased faster than
we

01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
anticipated thank
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
you just to remind the committee unlike
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy charter schools and uh efas
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's no open warrant for special
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
education funding there's no mechanism
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
for the Department to draw a warrant to
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
pay that difference they can't come to
 
01:19:00.510 --> 01:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee for additional funds to
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
pay that difference so it would require
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
legislation if you wanted to do anything
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
for a fiscal 25 for instance I well
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
understand all of that well the first
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
the first place you have to start though
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
data but I but I do understand that
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
would require fiscal or something to be
 
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to handle it well what I'm
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
saying is fiscal can't under current law
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
current law right but we got to and
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
there are bills I'll just remind there
 
01:19:30.709 --> 01:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
are bills mostly in the Ed funding
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee right now that deal with this
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
one that I think eliminates the pration
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
entirely one that sets it that it can
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
never go lower than 85% and should any
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
of those pass they would be referred
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
here and it could be something we
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
incorporate in in your budget package
 
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
right and keep in mind the Senate can do
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
anything uh okay they can put a bill in
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
in middle of whenever and allocate money
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
for whatever so the question is is the
 
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
information there that would allow us to
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
take the next step which is to try to
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
rectify the situation and get ahead of
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
it that's all I'm
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
asking but thank you I appreciate your
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
responses and I don't fault the
 
01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
education w at all for the budgeting
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
that's not my that's that's not my point
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
at all it's just a question of can we
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
track things better and have have an
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
idea we're going to we're going to run
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
into an issue um before June represent
 
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.030 align:start position:0%
into an issue um before June represent
of

01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:20:21.629 --> 01:20:21.639 align:start position:0%
Dy just
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
curious do you trend
 
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
the special ed um I the um when they you
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
know I'm sorry I lost my trainer thought
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
here but a student has an IEP and it's
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
all these different things do the
 
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
schools or you Trend all of these issues
 
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
that the students are
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
having that we have to appropriate for
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you that
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
question Pur well it you wouldn't
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily have their name but every
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
student that has a slew of IEPs for
 
01:20:56.350 --> 01:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they are I mean is there
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
any kind of trending that is done on
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
that that we can see that there's a
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
certain problem that's happening it
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
seems to be more
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
consistent do you do you understand what
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I I'm not entirely sure if
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
you're talking about per disability like
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at a like a cost of
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
that or if we're looking at I I I think
 
01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:21.719 align:start position:0%
the that it would be challenging to do
 
01:21:25.470 --> 01:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
that piece of it um I get I'm probably
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
talking more about because we have a lot
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
of students it's growing the
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities are growing so we know
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
something's happening right okay and
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
then we have to appropriate funds for
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
each one of
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
these issues somebody has to deal with
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
maybe reading or mathematical or
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be and then wellness
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
and and all these things that we're
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
paying for is that correct this the
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
various different disabilities aren't
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
appropriated separately no um no so the
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
way it works is we have a base amount
 
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
that's in adequacy that every single kid
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
that has an IEP is is entitled to
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
receive all the school district is
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to receive for that kid and
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
then there's some federal funds and
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
whatnot and then when you have a child
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
that is high cost because the IEP just
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
is a essentially a schedule of services
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
it describes a child's disability an
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
educational plan to get the child um to
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
help with the children's and then
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
services that are needed for that child
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any of that cost
 
01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
information it it doesn't say this
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
kiding OT and it's going to cost $50,000
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
or something like that until a school
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
district knows that child has high costs
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
usually the kid has pretty severe
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities to meet this three and a
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
half times and then that's when they
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
start saying like all right well let's
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
find all of the invoices associated with
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn Davis and submit those to the
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Education because we think
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to be eligible for this um
 
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
pool of funds but we have 30,000 kids in
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that are have
 
01:22:56.350 --> 01:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
an IEP and we're talking about less than
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
a thousand of those kids so a very small
 
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of those kids we're talking
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
about in total for this okay that
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
you carry on was there somebody else
 
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
that's it for special ed then we're
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay or do we not have any extras of
 
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
those do we have any extra building Aid
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
ones Micky or do we pass them all out
 
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
oh oh
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah I got one thanks Jim this
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
and you put everybody all in the same
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
okay perfect
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
thanks um all right so next upep we're
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
going to switch over to the Bureau of
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
school facilities um again this is one
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
that is in uh my area of expertise uh
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
Tim Carney is our new administrator of
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
the bureau he's three weeks on the job
 
01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
now yeah about three weeks um so his
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
first day was presenting to you guys at
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education so that was
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
pretty impressive that he was able to do
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
that he's learned a little bit more a
 
01:24:36.669 --> 01:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
little bit more um but so I'm going to
 
01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
let him take the reins but we'll deal
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
with questions as they come great well
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Caitlyn so again uh Tim Carney
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
Bureau administrator for the uh Bureau
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
of school
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
facilities and we have three packets
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
today three programs uh School building
 
01:24:53.629 --> 01:24:53.639 align:start position:0%
Aid Charter School lease Aid and then
 
01:24:55.109 --> 01:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as say uh the safe
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
Grant security action for Education
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
grants so if we I can start with the
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
school building Aid packet we should all
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
have that um we'll go Page by page if
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
that's okay uh so again the first page
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
just a summary um of what we're going to
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
be going through uh contact information
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
I did update this slightly from the
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
packet that you received back in
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
January uh one so my contact information
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
wasn't three hole punched out um
 
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
and so the school building aid program
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
it it allows uh provide State funds for
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
school districts uh in support of
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
meeting the costs of uh constructing
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
renovating replacing school facilities
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
um the grants range from 30 to 60% of
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of the eligible cost of
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
construction uh and we'll get into that
 
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
um across the state um so we have 30% is
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
for more affluent communities 60% for
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
Less affluent communities the average
 
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
across the state in the last number of
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
years um before the the
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
um um moratorium it was about
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
38% uh the funding source is the
 
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and there was a lot
 
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
of change in
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
2013 so from it's a very old program
 
01:26:22.109 --> 01:26:22.119 align:start position:0%
1946 uh the state paid a percentage of
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
the principle over the life of a bond so
 
01:26:25.229 --> 01:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
if it's School District took out a
 
01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
20year bond every year the state would
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
pay between 30 and 60% of that Bond
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
payment um that law was changed in
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
2013 and now it's more we pay current
 
01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
costs and so right now we're paying 80%
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
Upfront for a school that gets awarded
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
building Aid so it's 80% of that 60 to
 
01:26:48.910 --> 01:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
30% and then upon completion of the
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
project and some uh auditing and uh data
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
submission to our office for
 
01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
verification uh we will award up to the
 
01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:00.510 align:start position:0%
verification uh we will award up to the
remaining

01:27:00.510 --> 01:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
remaining
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
20% uh so that's I have an example for
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
how we used to do it and how we do it
 
01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
currently um the 2013 law also capped
 
01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
the amount of school building Aid
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
appropriated to no more than 50 million
 
01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
per year and it also created a
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant structure uh that we
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
go through a ranking process for these
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
projects um the former way we did
 
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
between 46 and
 
01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
2012 virtually every school that came
 
01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
forward with a qualifying project was
 
01:27:31.639 --> 01:27:33.430 align:start position:0%
forward with a qualifying project was
awarded

01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
awarded
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
funding um so the the uh schools are
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
ranked higher if they address project uh
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
life safety issues Ada deficiency
 
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
overcrowding consolidation and in the
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
law these different components of the
 
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
application have different points and
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
that's how the ranking is done by a team
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
um in myself and we bring in Engineers
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
to assist us with that um to do a
 
01:28:01.629 --> 01:28:01.639 align:start position:0%
ranking of all the projects we receive
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh this coming April and that's when the
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
applications are due for new projects um
 
01:28:10.030 --> 01:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
will be the first cohort that's done
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
under this new set of rules and so that
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
will be an interesting uh bit of work to
 
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
see how what we run into as far as
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences sometimes when
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
you implement these types of new rules
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh I won't go through the the
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
detailed building Aid funding history
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
but you will see between 2010 and 2017
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
there was a moratorium complete
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
moratorium on projects um and then there
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
was a couple projects
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
1819 um that one emergency funded
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
project uh 2020 and 21 the moratorium
 
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
was lifted again we had a competitive
 
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
project application process I was
 
01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:54.520 align:start position:0%
involved with that with Amy Clark my
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
predecessor as one of the folks who was
 
01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
um invited on the ranking team just
 
01:29:03.149 --> 01:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
because of my background um and then uh
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
in 2022 23 12 applications received only
 
01:29:10.109 --> 01:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
two projects were funded and then
 
01:29:13.709 --> 01:29:13.719 align:start position:0%
2425 uh again competitive process 17
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
applications were received uh three
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
applications were selected for
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
funding we want to flip over to the
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
second page again just a quick
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh table on the history I won't get into
 
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of detail on this but it it a lot
 
01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
of what I just talked about is summarize
 
01:29:35.709 --> 01:29:35.719 align:start position:0%
here in visual format um and you can see
 
01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
46 to
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
2009 um there were 62 applications
 
01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
funded and I think that was um again my
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
predecessor created this one so I'm not
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
sure if that's a total or if that's more
 
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
of an average for that
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
period yes it's average by any okay yes
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
so bium average so 62 per bium again
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's when schools if they had a
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable application they were awarded
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
funding so it wasn't a competitive
 
01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:05.470 align:start position:0%
funding so it wasn't a competitive
process

01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480 align:start position:0%
then do want to point out too it's
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
allowable costs so not everything a
 
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
school is building is allowable and we
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
actually when we'll talk about the
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
examples we can we can kind of give you
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
we can show about that lat later on in
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
packet sure thank you so we want to flip
 
01:30:19.679 --> 01:30:21.189 align:start position:0%
packet sure thank you so we want to flip
the

01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
page to the
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
School building aid funds graph um so
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
there's three components to the the
 
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me the each annual payment um
 
01:30:38.109 --> 01:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
dark blue obligated payment sets from
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
what we call the tail those projects
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
before the
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
moratorium uh in 2010 there was a state
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
Bond uh taken out to make the annual
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
Bond payment um or maybe the banum at
 
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
that point um and so that's the light
 
01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.669 align:start position:0%
that point um and so that's the light
blue

01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
blue
 
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
and then new projects or funding
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
available for new projects is the dashed
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
line and so in 24 we had 22.6 million
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
available for new projects and 25
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
similarly we had 26.1 million if the
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
project uh the the maximum is held at
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
$50 million we just look at 26 and 27 so
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
26 that would allow the department to
 
01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
potentially award 28.9 million for new
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
projects those would be the projects
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
coming in April 1st of this year and
 
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
million any questions
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
on anything so far yes repr ha Phillips
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
um I think in the past when we've had
 
01:31:47.390 --> 01:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
extensive conversations about this um
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
there's always been the question can we
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
pay our debt service earlier to try to
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
end the tale before for
 
01:31:57.750 --> 01:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
2041 and I correct me if I'm wrong but
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that there's not a
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
early like there is a prepayment penalty
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
so we can't work on those debt
 
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
payment in advance it that's kind of how
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
bonds work it's not like a mortgage
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
where you can pay them off early exactly
 
01:32:11.270 --> 01:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's what the challenge
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
has been because these school districts
 
01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
took out bonds so even if we gave the
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
funds to the schools um to pay it off
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
early there would be no way for the
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
schools to pay off their bond early and
 
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
schools can't just hang on to funds
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
so it definitely creates complicated
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
structure but yeah last year when there
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
was a lot of EXT excess money in the
 
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that was a
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
conversation that was
 
01:32:37.229 --> 01:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
had one more uh so
 
01:32:41.709 --> 01:32:41.719 align:start position:0%
um building on that conversation as well
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
has been a concern of whether or not the
 
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
50 million allocated in each budget
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
year is in a lapsing or a
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
non-aps um track and so I'm just
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could speak to that as
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
well so it it it lapses if there's
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
excess funds that does lapse it laps
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
back to the education trust fund so it's
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
not going back to the general fund in
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
the past it would have laed lapsed into
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
the general fund but because it's also
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
an education trust fund um there was a
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
proposal to have a specific building Aid
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
fund that we talked about in division
 
01:33:15.109 --> 01:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
two last year um but that proposal
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
didn't make it I think it was came from
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget um and but it
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
two represent papovich thank you not as
 
01:33:27.790 --> 01:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
much a question but just adding a bit
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
more context to what my colleague was
 
01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.550 align:start position:0%
more context to what my colleague was
asking

01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
about um because the tail is just
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
reimbursing school districts individual
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
school districts for Bond payments that
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
they are obligated to the state could
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
even make them refinance if it wanted to
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
and also every school district has
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
negotiated specific terms on their bonds
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
now some of them may be payable early if
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
the school district had an inclination
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
to but then we don't have mechanism to
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
do that and some of them are non-p
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
payable early and it depends whether you
 
01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
went directly to the banks or you went
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
through the uh you know it basically
 
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
becomes so complicated that I think at
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
the state level based on the benefits
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
that we would get it would probably not
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
be the best way for us to spend
 
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislative time because it would be a
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
very minimal return
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
so great thank you uh turning to the
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
next page so we we have school building
 
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
Aid factors and this is just some more
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
detailed information um so this is uh we
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
calculate our school building Aid
 
01:34:35.109 --> 01:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
factors and that leads us into what the
 
01:34:38.109 --> 01:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
the aid rates are the 30 to 60% I
 
01:34:40.950 --> 01:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um we do you know if
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the the note toward the
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
bottom it does say that these building
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
Aid factors are function of
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities medium family income and
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
the equalized value per pupil so it does
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
take some of that poverty or affluence
 
01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
into effect um so that's some detail
 
01:34:59.109 --> 01:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
there and
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
then two pages of that so that's on the
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
second page as
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
well and then if you want to take a look
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
at the the following page that's the
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
school building Aid descending rank
 
01:35:12.870 --> 01:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
order list and so this is the current
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
list that we're working off of that was
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
approved by the school building
 
01:35:19.229 --> 01:35:19.239 align:start position:0%
authority and then the state published
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
by the State Board of
 
01:35:23.709 --> 01:35:23.719 align:start position:0%
Education um and there were 17
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
applications received those were all
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
ranked and we had um three that were
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
able in the process to accept the
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
funding and move forward with their
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
projects and that was uh so number one
 
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh out of Rochester number three which
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
is group of projects out of madok and
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
then all the way down to number 10 uh
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
which is Barnstead and so you know when
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
we go through the rankings and we let
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
schools know a lot of times they're
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
disappointed if they're further down the
 
01:35:53.470 --> 01:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
list but it really shows that you know
 
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
what what happens at the local level
 
01:35:58.590 --> 01:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
really impacts um you know their ability
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
to pass their bond or portion funding
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the the project um really
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
impacts what happens below so again
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
Barnstead initially was very
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
disappointed uh but working through the
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
process they ended up getting funding
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
for their project and they're they're
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
breaking ground in the middle of June
 
01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
now um and so you know we do let
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
potential applicants know
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
that you're not necessarily out of the
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
running if you're not number one or
 
01:36:28.719 --> 01:36:30.590 align:start position:0%
running if you're not number one or
number

01:36:30.590 --> 01:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
two just one other thing I want to point
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
out on this slide as well is so before I
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
was talking about the allowable cost so
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at the Nancy School Nancy
 
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
loud School in Rochester so Rochester is
 
01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
a 60% Community you can see that their
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
estimated project cost is $33 million so
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
60% of $33 million is 20 million but you
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
can see the maximum building Aid award
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
is only 15 15 million that's because
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
they had costs in their total project
 
01:36:57.990 --> 01:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't necessarily be allowed
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
under building Aid now I don't know off
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
the top of my head what they
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
specifically were but some of those
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
things may include you know construction
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
there's a cap on construction cost per
 
01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
square foot um there's certain types of
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
um I can't even think of examples but
 
01:37:13.950 --> 01:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
there are things that are not allowable
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
that the state will not reimburse and so
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
a school may need to cover more expenses
 
01:37:21.550 --> 01:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
to do the complete project um or if they
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
have something that is um
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
much more robust and design than the
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
state will pay for the state won't kind
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
of take those extra costs in and that's
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
that's coming up relative to at least
 
01:37:34.270 --> 01:37:34.280 align:start position:0%
one of the projects on this list if you
 
01:37:35.709 --> 01:37:35.719 align:start position:0%
kind of look down through the list
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
you're like well that's a very high paid
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
project well not all of that is
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
allowable through the state so it's not
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
60% of the total project it's 60% of the
 
01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
allowable costs and that's that's
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
important and to recognize because there
 
01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
in Rochester for example there was a lot
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
of confusion about that we talked about
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
it in the Senate phase of the budget
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
because the chair of Senate Finance is
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
from Rochester and so it came up quite a
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
bit uh but that's that's just important
 
01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
for the committee to know as we were
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
talking through this representative
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
hafeld Oh I thought you thank you we
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
were just wrestling about who should go
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
first um let your arm wrestle first
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
represented phps um could you please uh
 
01:38:16.589 --> 01:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
walk us through what happens when a
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
community for instance like C Brook was
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
number two on this list um you know is
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
notified that they they're
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
they've received this ranking and um a
 
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
project is El to be paid out and they go
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
back to their town and hold their you
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
know meeting to decide whether or not
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
they're going to fund the bond and that
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
fails could you talk about what happens
 
01:38:43.629 --> 01:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
next yeah and so I'm trying to get my uh
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
Amy provided me a nice little flowchart
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
that I will cheat off of um and so yeah
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
so what happens is once the ranking is
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
determined there's a letter of intent
 
01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
sent to that district and the district
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
has the ability to either sign that or
 
01:39:01.109 --> 01:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
say U we're not we don't want to
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
participate and then they they move to a
 
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
different pathway um as if they sign the
 
01:39:09.149 --> 01:39:09.159 align:start position:0%
letter of intent they get um I believe
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's three opportunities to pass their
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
local vote and so it really depends on
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with what happen
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
specifically with colbrook if there if
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
it was at the letter of intent stage or
 
01:39:23.709 --> 01:39:23.719 align:start position:0%
if it was one or two or three votes that
 
01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:26.679 align:start position:0%
occurred before they came you know they
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
got passed over but that's my
 
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is the communities have
 
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
that opportunity over three budget
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
periods to to make that just a little
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
Nuance because the programs changed so
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's the timing of the program changed
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
they used to have to submit everything
 
01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education in the
 
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
summer and then it had to be ranked by
 
01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
January which this committee typically
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
would have the ranked list when you were
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
making these decisions the timing was
 
01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
changed applications need to be
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
submitted to the department by April y
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
year which means we don't have a rank
 
01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
list for you I it was funny when we were
 
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
working on the program I think the
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
biggest challenge I thought was division
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
2 is going to be mad about this but
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
whatever um the legislators are writing
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
this law so they have to understand that
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
um but So Co Brook had two opportunities
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
to vote for the project just because of
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
the timing and so they received a letter
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
in intent and they had two opportunities
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
and um they were not able to get
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere I think they only received 30%
 
01:40:24.070 --> 01:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
of their Town vote so nowhere yes to
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
nowhere close to the amount needed to
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
approve a bond so just as a followup so
 
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
what happens at the department after you
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
learn from a community that they're not
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
able to take advantage of the program
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
how do you move down your list like how
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
does that work I believe it's at the I
 
01:40:41.709 --> 01:40:41.719 align:start position:0%
haven't been through this process but I
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
believe it's at the next cycle we repeat
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
that same process with it in first of
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
all may under the current rule um will
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
receive responses from the current uh
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
lists who aren't funded if they want to
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
stay on the list because some schools
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
are going to move forward right and so
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
based on that list we'll start that
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
process again where we'll issue the
 
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
letter of intent and see where they're
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
at one thing that's tricky about this
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
program too is that if you decide to
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
move forward with your project before
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
being awarded building Aid you are no
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
longer eligible for building Aid so that
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
means some people will wait and other
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
people will say I have to deal with this
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
there's no money available from the
 
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
state but this issue is so bad right now
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
that we have to do this or that a school
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
just say no this is a prior or District
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
sorry a community says this just a
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
community this is a priority for us
 
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to fund this with or without
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
the state um but yeah so with the
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
coldbrook money that's exactly what
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
happens to the C Brook money so we
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
actually had enough money for
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
essentially three projects that we knew
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
Rochester C Brook and madok we went
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
through we offered the money to
 
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
Rochester they said we were going to
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
take it we offered to C Brook they said
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
we'll take it we'll go to vote then we
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
offered to madok they said yep we'll
 
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
take it we'll go to vote um Rochester
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
and manano they voted they passed it co
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
Brooks failed the first time and then
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
went the second time failed again so
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
they let us know and so then that's when
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
we started moving down the list to all
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
of the other projects and we the first
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
group that said that we will take it was
 
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
Barnstead so yeah and I think another
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
Nuance of the program is that if you're
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
offered full funding of your project
 
01:42:20.189 --> 01:42:20.199 align:start position:0%
under building Aid um and you deny it
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
then you you based on that letter of
 
01:42:24.589 --> 01:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
intent before you go to vote then then
 
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
you're off the list but if you're only
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
awarded partial funding or offered
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
partial funding in deny it you can stay
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
on the list which makes sense because
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
many schools can't move forward with
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
their project unless they get the full
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
building Aid so they're elect not to
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
take partial and stay on the list and
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
back to your previous question so had
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
Barnstead not taken that money because
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
we were actually when we were going down
 
01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
this like oh we might be lapsing some
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
building a money that $12 million would
 
01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
have lapsed back to the education trust
 
01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.669 align:start position:0%
have lapsed back to the education trust
fund

01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
um if if Barnstead or somebody after
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
funds representative
 
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
Murray yeah I think you pretty much um
 
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
went through all the questions I I
 
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask about if they can stay on
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
the list and not lose their ranking so
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
um but something had they would still be
 
01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
able they're still on the list even
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
though when there was some some
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
discussion about you could Main maintain
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
your rating ranking if that's actually
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest changes about this
 
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
new program is is that you get to stay
 
01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
on the list year after year so remember
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
submitting an application for building
 
01:43:35.910 --> 01:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
Aid is very burdensome for a school
 
01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
district there's a lot of costs
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
associated with an end time associated
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
with it and so um when the legislature
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
decided to change this a lot of that was
 
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
these schools that are submitting these
 
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
applications are spending all this time
 
01:43:49.910 --> 01:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't have to want them to
 
01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
reapply every single year but there was
 
01:43:54.990 --> 01:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
no me mechanism for a school district to
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
not have to reapply and there was no
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
mechanism for a school district to
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
update the costs of their project so now
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
under the new program once you submit a
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
allowable project and we've approved it
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
and ranked it it stays on the list um
 
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
and at the time when you're going to
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
build your project that we've awarded
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
the money you're up you're allowed to
 
01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
update your construction costs so um
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
with uh what is that means yeah RS means
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
so and I think another thing that to add
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh based on your ranking question is
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
that the remaining 14 of the 17 that are
 
01:44:35.550 --> 01:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
ranked they will stay and applications
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
we get in April um there's one exception
 
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
for extraordinary circumstances but
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
other than that the new cohort of
 
01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
applicants will come in below those
 
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
14 um and I think that's important to
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
understand and I think the last bit of
 
01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
information is uh the the tail payments
 
01:44:57.070 --> 01:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
more detail on those tail payments if
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
you wanted to uh dig into that
 
01:45:02.189 --> 01:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
information um it shows what districts
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
and uh the projects and eligible costs
 
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
um and the payments for fiscal year 24
 
01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:14.390 align:start position:0%
um and the payments for fiscal year 24
and

01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
25 so do just one more Pro with building
 
01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
Aid these are large scale Renovations or
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
building of new school schol these are
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
not for smaller projects this is you
 
01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
know this is one of the questions that
 
01:45:27.830 --> 01:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
comes up but can a school district
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
submit for building Aid if they want to
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
have a new HVAC system it's it's not for
 
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
that type of project it's for a wh scale
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
renovation new school maybe a wing of a
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
school if it's large enough but these
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
projects all
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
right repr hacka Phillips um Team I'm
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can um remind me this
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
was kind of the
 
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
the thing we were trying to sus out last
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
term about the
 
01:46:02.109 --> 01:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
actual um you know estimated need over
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
time for the current like facility stock
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
we have in the state um you know if our
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
$50 million cap per year once we work on
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
The Debt Service and we're looking at a
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
17 school project list that we can only
 
01:46:19.229 --> 01:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
fund three schools there's there's
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
clearly a need outside of the 50
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
million you you know cap so um I think
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
at one point last
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
term there was a discussion about you
 
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
know if we were if we were to try to
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
quantify what the need is year-over-year
 
01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
eliminate having school projects that
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
don't get funded like these building
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
projects that don't get funded what
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
would that look like and I um I think we
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
were just talking what so I was part of
 
01:46:50.109 --> 01:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
those conversations the resolution to
 
01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
that was that you all wanted the
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
department of education to do a state
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
facilities assessment to to kind of
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
collect all of this information um which
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
we were which costs quite a bit of money
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh there's companies that do this other
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
states have gone through their process
 
01:47:06.910 --> 01:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
and they'll they go through because we
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a comprehensive inventory of
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
school facilities in the state and I
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
know many people in the legislature
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
would want that um so there was a law
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
put in place and the funding was
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
actually also in that bill when we
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
talked about the um the school building
 
01:47:22.109 --> 01:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
Aid fund that was an allowable use of
 
01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
the school building fund um but
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that bill failed and then
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
there was a second bill to make it an
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
allowable use of the public school
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund which we will talk
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
about in a moment that bill also failed
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
so the department hasn't made any
 
01:47:37.589 --> 01:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
additional progress on that request
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for reminding me
 
01:47:41.709 --> 01:47:41.719 align:start position:0%
representative Murray yeah thank you for
 
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
that U to remind us of that do you have
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
a sense of the cost of inflation between
 
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
a CA when the building is the proposal
 
01:47:51.870 --> 01:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
is sent to you and the year and a half
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
or potentially two years before it is
 
01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
built you know it's going to go up the
 
01:47:57.589 --> 01:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
inflation has been somewhat more
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
significant uh now than it has been in
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
the past how do you account for that how
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
can schools plan for that so that's when
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
the schools are allowed to update their
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
application and specifically the
 
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
construction cost per square foot we
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
actually just had one so when we had
 
01:48:12.030 --> 01:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
originally approved the project we
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
approved a construction cost per square
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
foot of 194 and I believe their actuals
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
came in around what 286 yeah 286 so they
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
um but that that is that school district
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
is from the time that they sent the
 
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
application was the 294 to the time the
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
project was completed so there's a
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
little um that's partially why this
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
project has or this program has evolved
 
01:48:37.149 --> 01:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
to allowing them to update that on that
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
list and that hopefully accounts for it
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
now it's not going to necessarily
 
01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
account for all of it and if changes
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
need to be made from the time the
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
project started to the time the project
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
ends through you know a change order
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
process which might have some
 
01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:51.639 align:start position:0%
significant cost there's no additional
 
01:49:03.310 --> 01:49:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
that great so should we move on to
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
Charter School Lee a yeah
 
01:49:12.589 --> 01:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
okay so the uh the second program is
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
Charter School lease Aid and again you
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
have a packet for that similarly the the
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
first page is just a cover sheet with
 
01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.510 align:start position:0%
first page is just a cover sheet with
some

01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:49:23.310 --> 01:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
information so Charter School lease a as
 
01:49:26.589 --> 01:49:26.599 align:start position:0%
the name implies allows uh provides
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
lease assistance to charter schools that
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
are leasing the buildings rather than
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
owning them um grants are are 30% of the
 
01:49:37.149 --> 01:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
annual lease payment and there's a cap
 
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
of $50,000 per
 
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
year um obviously like I mentioned
 
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
Charter School Charter Public Schools
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
that own their buildings are now
 
01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:48.159 align:start position:0%
eligible and funding source education
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund and provide a brief history
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the uh lease Aid law and payments
 
01:49:57.629 --> 01:49:57.639 align:start position:0%
that was the law was created in
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
2003 sorry um but it was only funded for
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
the first time in fiscal year
 
01:50:08.669 --> 01:50:08.679 align:start position:0%
20 and uh again the data is there um
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year the appropriation number of
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools requesting the aid It's
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
Not Unusual for CH some charter schools
 
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
to lease their building and then proceed
 
01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:17.830 align:start position:0%
to lease their building and then proceed
their

01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
ownership um the amount eligible and
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
again because we do have a 30% percent
 
01:50:26.589 --> 01:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
percentage and then a cap of
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
50,000 um if the appropriation does not
 
01:50:33.629 --> 01:50:33.639 align:start position:0%
match the demand um that payment to each
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
each charter school is prated as you can
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
see in the second to last column um and
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh also there's a shortage shown there
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
as well um we do estimate there's going
 
01:50:47.589 --> 01:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
to be an increase in the demand for
 
01:50:49.950 --> 01:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
Charter School lease Aid not only due to
 
01:50:51.830 --> 01:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
cost but also due to additional Charter
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
Schools coming coming
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
online and so uh part of the process
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
these completed applications are due to
 
01:51:01.470 --> 01:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
the department on September 1st of each
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
year and um Carrie Gorman does a great
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
job with processing that information and
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
getting those payments
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
out um the next
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
page just again more detail uh list of
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
all the chartered schools at the time we
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
put this together for
 
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
25 um I believe there's a couple that
 
01:51:23.229 --> 01:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
have been approved but not yet open
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see those next year and
 
01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
again this just gives some more detail
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
um and again it's the far right column
 
01:51:35.950 --> 01:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see we had this question
 
01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
before so sometimes uh when obviously
 
01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
when there's no lease it it means they
 
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
either did not apply or they own their
 
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
building so Academy of Science and
 
01:51:48.030 --> 01:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
representative hack
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
Phillips I'm just wondering if there's
 
01:52:00.669 --> 01:52:00.679 align:start position:0%
ever a case where uh lease a is
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
distributed to a
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
charter for um for like I guess my
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
question is is this Aid distributed with
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
a time lag or is it in real time and is
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
there a case where a charter may have
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
closed mid school year or you know midf
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
funding cycle so that some of that age
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
should be returned or does that not
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
happen so the schools that closed last
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
year specifically because those were the
 
01:52:30.189 --> 01:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
ones that made the news um neither of
 
01:52:35.229 --> 01:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
them received lease Aid um so but um if
 
01:52:37.870 --> 01:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
a school were to receive lease Aid we
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
would make one payment at the beginning
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
of the year it is the amount in theory
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
for the full year and if they were to
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
close a right now there's no really
 
01:52:46.109 --> 01:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
mechanism for a proportional amount of
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
that money to come back to the
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
department um both the schools that Clos
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
last year closed because of s
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
significant Financial issues um and at
 
01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
least one of them ended up in bankruptcy
 
01:52:59.310 --> 01:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
there were no assets or funds for the
 
01:53:01.629 --> 01:53:01.639 align:start position:0%
Department to receive any funding back
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
um on that but it it is distributed once
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
program all right one more topic for
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
today safe grants safe GRS you want to
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
do it I can do safe GR just didn't dive
 
01:53:26.709 --> 01:53:26.719 align:start position:0%
into it oh sure sure so safe grants um
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
the security action for education grant
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
um is a subset of the public school
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund so the public school
 
01:53:39.310 --> 01:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund was a fund that was
 
01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
um I don't know invented by the
 
01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2017 as part of the
 
01:53:48.069 --> 01:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
budget cycle uh to allow initially for
 
01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
smaller projects so maybe not building
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
Aid eligible projects but other project
 
01:53:54.069 --> 01:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
project that schools may have for
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
schools to apply there were three uses
 
01:53:58.189 --> 01:53:58.199 align:start position:0%
of the public school infrastructure
 
01:54:02.069 --> 01:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
funds school safety grants e rates and
 
01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
safety grants e- rates sorry e- rate um
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
my gosh uh like expansion of um like uh
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
like internet to schools and whatnot um
 
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
so e- rate expansion and then oh my gosh
 
01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
oh oh so just oh small infrastructure
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
projects so like a HVAC or something
 
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
like that um these were actually part of
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
the conversations that were being had at
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
the time where conquered steam was
 
01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
shutting down and conquered School
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
District was trying to seek additional
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
funds to um supplement the conversion
 
01:54:36.030 --> 01:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
because of the conquered steam um and so
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
that was that was part of the
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
conversation when those funds were
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
originally um invented developed
 
01:54:45.149 --> 01:54:45.159 align:start position:0%
whatever um so what had what the
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
legislation enabled was after the fiscal
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
year was closed from the state and after
 
01:54:54.030 --> 01:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund was topped off at 100
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
million or 200 million whatever the
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
amount was at there any excess General
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
funds would go into this fund called the
 
01:55:01.990 --> 01:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund and
 
01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
become available for school districts to
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
apply in a competitive manner to the
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so that was part
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the 2017 budget which we know goes
 
01:55:13.629 --> 01:55:13.639 align:start position:0%
into place in July 1st of 2018 the state
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
audit takes a you know six months to
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
wrap up we're not wrapped up for the say
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
the 24th fiscal year audit yet um in
 
01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
right in the February timeline of fiscal
 
01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.430 align:start position:0%
right in the February timeline of fiscal
year

01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:55:27.149 --> 01:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
2018 that's when we knew there was $18
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
million available to be distributed into
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
this public school infrastructure fund
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was around the same
 
01:55:36.189 --> 01:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
time as the Parkland school shooting so
 
01:55:37.629 --> 01:55:37.639 align:start position:0%
everybody will remember that happened in
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
February of
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
2018 and so um the primary use of these
 
01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
funds at that time or it was Prior
 
01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
prioritized was school safety projects
 
01:55:52.669 --> 01:55:52.679 align:start position:0%
so this is it is still Tech technically
 
01:55:54.189 --> 01:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
under the language of the public school
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund so that's important
 
01:55:57.470 --> 01:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
for the committee to understand but the
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
projects have been prioritized as far as
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
school safety and the majority of the
 
01:56:04.430 --> 01:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
funding has been used for school safety
 
01:56:07.390 --> 01:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
um so that was at first $18 million also
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
immediately after that school shooting
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
happened the legislature prioritized an
 
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
additional $10 million to be distributed
 
01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
to this fund to be used for school
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
safety projects since then there were um
 
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
a few additional distributions there was
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
a million dollar I think per year in 22
 
01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
and 23 um because this is a specific
 
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
fund um the money goes into the fund and
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
the interest earned on that is actually
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
distributed back into the fund so that's
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
help that that funds these projects um
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
and then unfortunately again there was
 
01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
another large school shooting in 22 I
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
believe it was the ubaldi school
 
01:56:46.589 --> 01:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
shooting and the state as a whole
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
allocated $10 million from the Gopher
 
01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
stimulus funding to this fund to we will
 
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
to provide school safety projects and
 
01:56:56.669 --> 01:56:56.679 align:start position:0%
then another $10 million of Education
 
01:56:59.189 --> 01:56:59.199 align:start position:0%
trust fund funds to be distributed to
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
these projects um so over the life of
 
01:57:05.069 --> 01:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
this um fund the public school
 
01:57:06.589 --> 01:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund these are the the
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
types of projects that have been funded
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
um the while larger school safety
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
projects were funded under the first uh
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
$28 million the last two grants were um
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
capped at $100,000 per square school um
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
not per District per school and there
 
01:57:27.310 --> 01:57:27.320 align:start position:0%
were three types of projects that were
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
prioritized surveillance access control
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
and emergency alerting um and so the way
 
01:57:36.669 --> 01:57:36.679 align:start position:0%
it works is that schools work with the
 
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security to have
 
01:57:40.270 --> 01:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
a security assessment they're also are
 
01:57:42.350 --> 01:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
required to have an emergency response
 
01:57:44.589 --> 01:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
plan and through that they determine
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
various different needs that they may
 
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
have um and then schools can apply to
 
01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education when we have
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
funds available um and award funds in
 
01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
the order that they were received with
 
01:57:57.790 --> 01:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
prioritizing certain projects so the
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
very first um kind of trunch of money
 
01:58:03.149 --> 01:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
with this new year of money we um the
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Homeland Security worked
 
01:58:06.430 --> 01:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
with us and the public school
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund committee which I
 
01:58:10.589 --> 01:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
should there's a committee made up of um
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
legislators and the State Board of
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
Education um that reviews these projects
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
and ranks the priorities of what we'll
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
rank um we awarded all of the access
 
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
control projects and then remaining
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
funds were distributed to the
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
surveillance and emergency alerting
 
01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
projects um let's see what didn't I
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
cover so how much money is in the fund
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
right now so 100% of the funds are
 
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
awarded to school districts we um
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
awarded the last bit of money uh I think
 
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
it was in the summer of 24 there's still
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
a weit list of I think 8 something
 
01:58:48.750 --> 01:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar um what the way it works
 
01:58:51.189 --> 01:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
is is so we award funds to a school and
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
then once a school closes out a project
 
01:58:55.550 --> 01:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
say if we had a $100,000 project and
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
they only need $888,000 that $122,000
 
01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
comes back and then we continue just
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
going down through the ranking project
 
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
so the last time we accepted
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
applications was in fiscal year 24
 
01:59:10.589 --> 01:59:10.599 align:start position:0%
awarded at the end of 24 maybe early 25
 
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
forget for the timing wise um and so
 
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
right now there's no free funds um there
 
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
is I don't know seven or 8 million
 
01:59:20.910 --> 01:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's there sitting there for schools
 
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
and they're they're working through the
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
projects um you some people are like
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
well if you wed These funds why didn't
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
schools immediately draw them down
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes it requires if it's a larger
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
project a school may need to put it in
 
01:59:33.069 --> 01:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
their budget for the next year they may
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
need to additional appropriate
 
01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
additional money locally they might need
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
to um just do you know they some of them
 
01:59:41.390 --> 01:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
um they might need to wait till the kids
 
01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
are out of school especially if it's a
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
large installation of a security project
 
01:59:47.069 --> 01:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
so if we Awards a fund to somebody right
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
now they may wait till next summer to
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
install it it's all reimbursement based
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
so we don't pay anybody for forward so
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
once they incur the cost then they can
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
request funds from the Department of
 
01:59:58.750 --> 01:59:58.760 align:start position:0%
Education and we will make the payment
 
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
and then close out the project and award
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
any fund to anybody else available so I
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
think it's $8.6 million or something
 
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
like that I can get you the exact amount
 
02:00:08.430 --> 02:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
on the wait list um and if we were to do
 
02:00:10.589 --> 02:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
you know a new RFP for schools they
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
whatnot uh representative Murray can you
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
say that again so there's 8 million 8
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
million in
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
requests that's outstanding let's see
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
and how many projects is that see the
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
weight lless total is actually in this
 
02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
packet I think it is yeah
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah so actually the wait list on
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
this and this is a point in time so I
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
think we actually ran this list in
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
November um but so as of right now we
 
02:00:44.109 --> 02:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
have a weight list of $9.2 million still
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
on the weight list it's on page 7 out of
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
and there were $21 million in the first
 
02:01:02.669 --> 02:01:02.679 align:start position:0%
two rounds that was the last that we
