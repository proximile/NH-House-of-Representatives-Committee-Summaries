recognize and understand that
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
revenues and expenditures now are not
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
really working together uh our Revenue
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
picture is is not as as bright as we'd
 
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
like to see it but we also recognize
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
that the adequacy formula which we have
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
um needs some help and so what we're
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
doing recognizing where we are during
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
the first year FY
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
26 the formula will remain the same as
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
it is right
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
now so going from left to right for the
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
base cost it's projected based upon the
 
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.829 align:start position:0%
base cost it's projected based upon the
2%

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
2%
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
increase uh that we normally get per
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
statute and the differentiate Aid
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
components will remain the same with the
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
same 2%
 
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
increase the extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
which is on the right hand side which is
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
used to support those communities with
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
equal valuation property valuations uh
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
with the denominator being the number of
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh free and reduced students uh that
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
will remain the
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
same so this is basically what the the
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
bill the amendment addresses for FY 26
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
for FY
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
27 it is
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
different we are recommending that again
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
you have that
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
increase in cost for that based upon the
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
2% and the base cost will jump to
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
$435 per
 
00:35:38.599 --> 00:35:40.470 align:start position:0%
$435 per
pupil

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
the amount for the fnr free and reduced
 
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
meal plan will jump to
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
$2,441 per
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
pupil the amount for English language
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
learner differentiated jump to
 
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
$849 and and the amount for uh
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue of Ed special
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
education uh differentiated Aid this is
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
not the catastrophic Aid this is special
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
education Aid will jump from the 2100 up
 
00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:12.150 align:start position:0%
education Aid will jump from the 2100 up
to

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
$3,140 and I'd like to speak to that
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
just for a
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
second the the committee in our
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
discussions and our research has looked
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
at and recognized that all IEPs are not
 
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.670 align:start position:0%
at and recognized that all IEPs are not
the

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:32.589 --> 00:36:32.599 align:start position:0%
same and there's 13 IEP
 
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
categories and and we've looked at those
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
categories and tried to figure out and
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
get information that is pretty much not
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
available to us from the department at
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
this time but how do we understand that
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
for example the to provide uh services
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
in the area of autism is going to be
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
more costly than that of a student
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
that's uh in another IEP category or and
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's 13 of them as I've mentioned so
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
what we did is we went and we've looked
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
at case loads that are recommended by
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
national organizations and come as close
 
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
as we can and developed a formula based
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
upon case loads to provide that service
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
IEP the number of students in the state
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
that have that
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
identifying case load or IEP
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
disability and figured out the number of
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
teachers that are necessary to provide
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
services let's say in the first category
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
autism we recognize that the cost of
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
providing service for a student with
 
00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
that type of ser all students in the
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
state is over $20 million 20.8 million
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
dollar whereas when we went down and
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
looked at some of the other areas uh
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
like hearing impaired yes but there's
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
only a few students in state so that
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
cost is only
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
$42,000 when we added all these up we
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
came to a cost to provide special
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
education in the area of I the
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
approximately $28 million more than what
 
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
we've been previously allocating in our
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
budget it jumped up close to $98
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
million and and the current expenditures
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
in that area are $68.7 million so we're
 
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
jumping roughly by that 28 million to
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
support that those services in uh FY 27
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
also we've looked at the right hand side
 
00:38:40.589 --> 00:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
of the formula and recognized that the
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant deals with the
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
property valuations we are also wanting
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
to look at something more specific that
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
incorporates what we had in our law back
 
00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
in 2011 fiscal capacity disparity Aid
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that is now injected into this
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
formula here and with
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
that we've have spreadsheets out there
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
available where you can see how that
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
will come out in terms of the various
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
communities and so Mr chair uh I believe
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
those uh spreadsheet has been handed out
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh and are available um at this point in
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
time I have nothing further to at this
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
time to to add to the
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
conversation okay
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment remains open
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
anybody El yes representative luno sure
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so um so I
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
think this this the amendment certainly
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
moves moves things in the right
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
direction I think it it um it recognizes
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
the um the um um The increased costs
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
associated with with special education
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
certainly not to the extent that school
 
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
districts um recognize them themselves
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
but uh but by increasing the
 
00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid by by um um uh more
 
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.309 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid by by um um uh more
over

00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
$1,000 U for the U for the special
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
education uh ADM I think that's very um
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
very significant uh also the um
 
00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
introduction of fiscal capacity
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid as its own separate unique
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh characterist or U uh Grant is uh is
 
00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:27.319 align:start position:0%
really important because it uh it does
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't conflate U two different things
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
like the extraordinary needs Grant does
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh access to resources and number of of
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
um of students coming from low-income
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
backgrounds it treats them as separate
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh yes as separate factors so I think
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's um that's that's very important I
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
also think um going through this
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
exercise certainly shows because it's a
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
little bit different than what we talked
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
about earlier last week um about bre up
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant but
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
because the extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
came in along with a hold harmless in an
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
effort to replace
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
stabilization uh there's there's
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
certainly a a complexity to um uh to
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
that uh to that Grant and I hope that's
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
something this committee will uh will
 
00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
continue to um uh to look at but uh but
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
I do support the amendment I do think it
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
moves Us in the right direction I hope
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
the committee sees that too okay thank
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you I I too will be
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment um and uh see
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
it as uh a good faith effort
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
to respond to the degree that we can
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
respond in the current circumstances
 
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
to um a school
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
funding system that needs a lot more
 
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
work uh so this is a small step I
 
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
support it it will be helpful to many
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
communities mostly in a small way but
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
maybe in a big way if you look locally
 
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
at what's
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
coming um so it's to the good for most
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
communities and um let's understand that
 
00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more work to be done thank
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
you further comments
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
representative fellas um yes can we have
 
00:42:34.349 --> 00:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
U some kind of an explanation about the
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
at the top of the spreadsheet the
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
description it has this uh cap of
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
3,750 can somebody please explain that
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
you so at the top of the spreadsheet
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's been handed out with the um award
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
per town There's um something
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
about um let's see the fiscal capacity
 
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.150 align:start position:0%
about um let's see the fiscal capacity
disparity

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
disparity
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
being not more than
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
3,700 per
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:21.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities I don't know I'm can you
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
just explain that it says municipalities
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
with 5,000 or more
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
ADM and no more then it's supposed to be
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
no more than
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
3,750 dollar per pupil can you just
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
explain that whole part of it uh yes I
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
think we can
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh I'd just like to preface what I'm
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
about to say I certainly want to be on
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
the record as uh uh saying that the
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
reinstatement of fiscal capacity
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid through this bill as
 
00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.630 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid through this bill as
amended

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
is in my estimation a
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
critical uh element for Property Port
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
Towns which I have the honor of
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
representing and uh it it will help
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
about 40 Target towns whose equalized
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
valuation per population is at the
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
lowest end of the
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
spectrum so to do that um there are a
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
limitations okay and the limitation of
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
Municipal ities with 5,000 plus
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
admr uh has to do with the skewed way in
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
which the extraordinary needs Grant
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
shifted an extraordinarily large amount
 
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
of money towards NASA and Manchester two
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
years ago and it partially corrects that
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh the only municipality that
 
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
actually uh would receive less under
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
this formula is
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I would characterize that
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
as a a dialing back uh of an excessive
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
swing of the pendulum two years ago um I
 
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:05.319 align:start position:0%
would also note that even as to
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester if you take their uh their
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
current uh uh appropriation and and the
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
allowance for 26 that doesn't change and
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
then consider that this doesn't take
 
00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
effect till 27 they've got two years
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
heads up and it works out to about 6
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
million a year so I don't know if that
 
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079 align:start position:0%
fully answers your question
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative fellows but the idea was
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
to to take a portion of the money that
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
has previously been dedicated to
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs and and reassign it
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
along another parameter that's been more
 
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
or less ignored in our law for the last
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
14 years since 2011 so so one of my
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
concerns is we have I haven't even seen
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
what the formula is for doing that that
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid if you
 
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
look in the bill
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the amendment well well I mean I
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
can read the words but pardon I can read
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
the words but we can't even see we don't
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity here to even see
 
00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:11.319 align:start position:0%
Which towns are being affected by that
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
extent yeah what is it that you're
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
asking for I'm asking to see oh first of
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
all I want to say I understand the
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
special ed the justification for
 
00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
increasing the special ed per pupil by
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
100 basically $100 per student a special
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
ed is being increased by
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
$1,041 per student 800 of which is uh an
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
adjustment we're making according to the
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
approach that representative lad
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
described and uh and then the other
 
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:55.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
adjustment okay so that that part I
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
understand so it I'm focusing on the um
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid and I
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
Town it doesn't I don't see that factor
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
town in accordance with the formula
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
which you'll see within this
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
amendment the formula go it it spreads
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
out the maximum Grant would be
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
$1,250 on the fiscal capacity of which
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
when you looking at your valuations per
 
00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
pupil it goes in a range from $1 million
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
to $1.6 million per pupil so those 40
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
communities which are in that range are
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
going to receive funding from the fiscal
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid
 
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.750 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid
um

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
that the swing towards using that we had
 
00:47:59.309 --> 00:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
basically for the extraordinary needs
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
Grant a limited amount of money $184
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
million roughly
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
to separate and place over and help some
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
of these property poor towns which we
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
have not been able to successfully do in
 
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
the past and I'm not advocating that
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
we're successfully doing it now but we
 
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
are putting together a formula which
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
directs money to those communities and
 
00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
recognizes the need that's exist in
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
property poor communities so there's 40
 
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
communities which will benefit from the
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
shift of some of that money which is
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
million so representative fellas the
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that we have been given
 
00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
allows you to look at any given town and
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
see what the change is right um I'm not
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
sure if you're asking for us to create a
 
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
new spreadsheet that would uh sort them
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
in some different way so this is mixed
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
in with the special ed increase
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
also so what I wanted to do was isolate
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal disparity and see how that
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
the the monies are just coming from that
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant area and the
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
the uh Revenue that's necessary that
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
additional $28 million which is
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
necessary to support differentiate Aid
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
special education is going to be new
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
money that we're going to have to come
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
from some other direction but we
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that we need to start looking
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
at the differentiated Aid and the
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
special education Aid category
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid where there is so much
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
commotion out in our local school
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
districts right now with the 68% that's
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
being allocated and and spread prated
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
back to those communities we're
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
recognizing these needs but we're also
 
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing that we we have to this move
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
we can't do it all at once the revenues
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
do not support that and and and looking
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
right now Department's been told cut
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
your budgets back cut your budgets back
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
8% or even more and so um we're trying
 
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
to send the policy message that fiscal
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid is a necessary
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
component to assist these communities
 
00:50:16.589 --> 00:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
that need that
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
help representative
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
and so just to comment on that too and
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
and you know I I appreciate
 
00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.280 align:start position:0%
representative fellows you know question
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
or or you know wanting to see a breakout
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal capacity disparity aid but
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
I think for purposes of of what we're
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
looking at here it's the use of of State
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
Grant dollars in their to
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
totality um and you can see from the top
 
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
line here the um the increase of of of
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
proposed FY 27 over current law uh FY 26
 
00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
when we count up all of the um the FY
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
proposed FY 27 the number the total
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
number of communities that benefit so
 
00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:03.390 align:start position:0%
number of communities that benefit so
there's

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
245 um cities and towns in the state 200
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
of them see an increase 45 see a
 
00:51:12.829 --> 00:51:12.839 align:start position:0%
decrease including Manchester being one
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
of them but but also the communities
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
that um um
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
yeah some others as as well and you can
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
see that from uh from this chart here
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
but uh but I think what it's what it
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
what it does demonstrate is the um um
 
00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
the the strong recognition that that
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
that not just the 40 um that benefit
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
from fiscal capacity to disparate but um
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
but 200 communities are benefiting from
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
uh from uh this change in the form well
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
of course because they're all going they
 
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
all have special ed and so they're all
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to get that extra what how much a
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
thousand, well yeah that's going to make
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
everybody go up I'm asking
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
well I'm asking about the fiscal
 
00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity a how many and how
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
much is the total amount being add being
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
disparity that you can't tell me who I
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
can I can only tell you that I have seen
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet that would tell us that
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't have it printed in with me
 
00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:26.870 align:start position:0%
but I don't have it printed in with me
um

00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
the LBA has that spreadsheet right now
 
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
and we can get copies for everybody here
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we're trying to hide
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's just that we've been rushed here
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
you do have it there repr does it have
 
00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.789 align:start position:0%
you do have it there repr does it have
the

00:52:39.789 --> 00:52:39.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:39.799 --> 00:52:49.910 align:start position:0%
the
break

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
yeah the see the number
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative Ames would you go
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
ahead the numbers I can do that would
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
would that uh do the trick
 
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so he's going to
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
read 40 of them and give me the N how
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
much so we're in an executive session
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I think the question is do we need
 
00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
more information in order to make a
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
decision today well that would be I
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
would my opinion on that is yes it's
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
also possible voting for something that
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
I haven't even had a chance to see
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
Mickey has it and you can get it over to
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
us yeah that he he's better at this yeah
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
I've got it but uh we've got it too yeah
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
so Jen and and just in total it's about
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
$ 13.3 million yeah just right yes
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah ask no I can you might give
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
a call to and find out if he's printing
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
them right now because they're probably
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
listen so give okay so every everyone
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
stand by for the moment we're trying to
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
printed so I'm I'm also concerned you
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
know whenever I have L looked at
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
formulas in the past one of the things I
 
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
always do is look at the per pupil
 
00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
amount that goes per town for the total
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
usually for the the total Grant and I
 
00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
don't look at the swep I tend to look at
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
just the grant because that's Act the
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
actual money that the state is
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative fellows could you please
 
00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
pull the mic closer I'm
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
sorry so one of the things I always have
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
looked at when I look at different you
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
know suggestions for formulas and I've
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
seen many many of them is I look at the
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
grant which is the amount that the state
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
actually sends in real dollars to the
 
00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.230 align:start position:0%
actually sends in real dollars to the
school

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480 align:start position:0%
district for the the benefit of a
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
particular town
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
and I I look at the per pupil amount so
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
I can because that's a way to compare
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
one town to the other and I think that
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
given how important this
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
is I'm very frustrated with the fact
 
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
that we're not having an opportunity
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
because of lack of time I realize to do
 
00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:42.710 align:start position:0%
because of lack of time I realize to do
that

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
has

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
any you just gave that spreadsheet to to
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.150 --> 00:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
then one of the things for the public
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge th this particular portion of
 
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
the formula that makes no changes to
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
sweat it makes no change this part of
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
the bill makes no change to sweat we
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
will have another bill later on our
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
shall we take a
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
recess I I just wanted to check exactly
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
what you know if if we want to move
 
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
forward you know with a vote or do we
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
want to pretty much we'll end up taking
 
00:56:40.109 --> 00:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
lunch and hope for the spreadsheets to
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
come back my only concern is that if we
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
do that and then we have further
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
requests for spreadsheets we may not be
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
able to accommodate them later in the
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
afternoon so I would leave it to you
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
know everybody to the ranking members to
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
figure that part out
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
but I want to remind everybody that we
 
00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
are a combination policy slf funding
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
committee and that we are proposing here
 
00:57:08.910 --> 00:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
a process a formula which will be sent
 
00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:11.839 align:start position:0%
on to division two and they will be
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
looking in depth that more spreadsheets
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
than we are going to have time to do
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
here we do have one that's coming but uh
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
as far as spending more time in the
 
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets I don't think we should I
 
00:57:26.029 --> 00:57:26.039 align:start position:0%
think we need to get moving forward here
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh um with the this bill uh I I given
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
the types of revenues we're dealing with
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any other way that's
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to really being able to allocate
 
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
these dollars limited dollars we have um
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
uh much better than what we've got in
 
00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
front of us right now and I'm not saying
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's the end all it's certainly not the
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
the end all but as we've said it's on
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
the path that we want to be on
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay so I I think that the comments just
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
made you know lead in the direction that
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
we know what the bill does we know what
 
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
its General intent is it's more or less
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
status quo funding with two significant
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
changes the one significant change is a
 
00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
significant bump up that's a result of a
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
different methodology for looking at
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
special ed allowance that results as
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative fellow said a benefit of
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh um over $1,000 per special ed student
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire State regardless
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
District the second thing that it does
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
is it brings back in if in Ana if
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
enacted it brings back into law a
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
critical element that is a part of the
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
balance of the overall funding equation
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
and that is the capacity of a community
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
to Bear real estate tax rates that are
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
in in many cases in excess of uh uh $30
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
and $20 or more for local ad alone and
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
if we if we get those two elements into
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
a bill that moves forward we are making
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
a very significant change so U I guess I
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to stifle debate but I I
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
will ask do we have enough information
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
in front of us now to go ahead with the
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
motion on the
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
amendment representative luno yeah thank
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair I I I I agree
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
that we have I think we've got
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
information in front of us now to move
 
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
forward with this amendment I agree um
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
with with representative fellow that we
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
don't have every piece of information um
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
but but I think we are at a um at a a um
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh a point in time now where where these
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
bills have to leave committee so that
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
they can go to the floor next week and
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
um and that they can go to finance and
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
be considered um as house policy to go
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
into the budget I think having fiscal
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid uh in any amount
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
is uh is is important from a policy
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint 13 million bucks is a little
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
thin on a Statewide basis but it may be
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
all we have to work with I think the
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
last time uh we did fiscal capacity
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid is a standalone item I
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
worked with representative walner in
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
2019 and it was a $65 million package
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
Statewide so 13 it was $65 Million last
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
time we had it it's $13 million now um
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
uh would love it if the finance
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
committee could see to it that that they
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
recognize the importance of fiscal
 
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:32.839 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid and could find
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
the additional money so that um so that
 
01:00:38.589 --> 01:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
more towns can uh can benefit uh more
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
towns that are that are struggling under
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
local property tax burdens so uh so I
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
think it's important to get this get
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
this thing moving out of committee and
 
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
to the floor and to finance I appreciate
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
all of those comments representative
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard for me to thank you for
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
recognizing me I'm sorry um it's hard
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
for me to to say um yes I agree with
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
both of these people uh um it it's we do
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
need more information we don't really
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
have time for more information I'm
 
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
hoping that fiscal
 
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
will take the time with the more
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
information um but
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to say
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
that given given
 
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
this there are a number of towns um I
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
would say close to a third
 
01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
that the actual for fiscal year
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
2024 is higher than the proposed for
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
2027 that that's a lot of people that we
 
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
are going to need to deal
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
with if we're not going to deal with it
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
now we need to deal with it next year
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of towns where actual
 
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
2024 is higher than um proposed fiscal
 
01:02:07.359 --> 01:02:08.269 align:start position:0%
2024 is higher than um proposed fiscal
year

01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
2027 so I think we will need to and I
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
don't know is there something else
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
coming along that will change that or is
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
that just something that next year we're
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
going to have to deal with that issue so
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
um valid comments and I agree with your
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
Long View I would just uh point out for
 
01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's benefit that remember that
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
the hold harmless provision is on a
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
steady decline and I think that a lot of
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
what you've described would Trace to
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
that which is part of current law thank
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
you very much yeah
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
and supp yes represent um yeah and when
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
we talk about that hold harmless
 
01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
remember we are dropping that 20% now
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
and and so we're down what around $47
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
million or thereabouts and when if we
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
combined that money in with what we had
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
in extraordinary needs and we've we've
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
done a lot of that discussion we could
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
be rounding it off to $250 million or
 
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
235 wherever it may stand out and now
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
trying to divide that up
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately yes a number of us have
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
said wow maybe we should put if it's 250
 
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we should put 150 in fiscal
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
capacity and the other in the other side
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
and the fnr stuff
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
um it's it's just a matter where you
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
push you know the balloon is got on is
 
01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
going to it's just that that old story
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
so but we've also when FY 24 you're
 
01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:34.839 align:start position:0%
talking about a different population too
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
than you are right now the enrollments
 
01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:40.039 align:start position:0%
are dropping in many of these districts
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
some districts are maintaining I agree
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
uh but overall our population in the
 
01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
state is declining Elementary K through
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
12 so there's a lot of issues associated
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
with now I do know that spreadsheet is
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
being run off right now and I don't
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
think I don't I don't want people to
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
believe that pushing something through
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
here without you having the opportunity
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
to see a spreadsheet I'd sit here five
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
more minutes before those spreadsheets
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
arrive so everybody can have a good
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
healthy look and see how these towns
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
shape up uh but what we've done here
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
this bill has really been done uh with
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh folks on both sides of the aisle
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
coming together and saying with the
 
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
dollar we have how can we best do
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
this and and that and that's where we
 
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
are yeah yes and I I would just Echo I
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
think it's it's been a delight to see
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
that this has been a bipartisan
 
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.470 align:start position:0%
that this has been a bipartisan
effort

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
so is that spreadsheet coming over
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative fellas so I just like to
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
say that I'm very disappointed that we
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't didn't as a whole committee we
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
didn't have the time to have that
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
discussion and to look at the
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
possibility if we knew we had a certain
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
amount of money to work with 30 million
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
or what you know whatever it was to look
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
at um different options for how to
 
01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
spread out that money I mean I'm not
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
saying you know so this is a choice that
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
was made to put some of it in special ed
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
and some of it in fiscal disparity with
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
a different formula than had been used
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
before there could have been there are
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
many other options and that we didn't
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
have a discussion in terms of policy or
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
by looking at the numbers to determine
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
what we might want to recommend instead
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
we just get this put together by I don't
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
know maybe four
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
people okay your comments are certainly
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
understood I'd like just interject one
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
thing here the money which we're putting
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
in differentiate Aid is new money it's
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
not money that's coming out of that $184
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
million or hold harmless it's on top of
 
01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
um and for us to be mess not messing
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
around but working with this formula we
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
recognize it's going to be difficult now
 
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
even under the situation we're in right
 
01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
now to find another 28 million dollar
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
there is one way which we've all looked
 
01:06:18.390 --> 01:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
at and we will be discussing later
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
today um and so I I don't be jumping
 
01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
ahead of myself either on this so that
 
01:06:25.279 --> 01:06:26.190 align:start position:0%
ahead of myself either on this so that
um

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
I yeah I I I do not know if if there's a
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
somebody here has a better answer to
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
comments okay uh then I believe we'll
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.950 --> 01:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
can we can we check to see can we check
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
to see we're so close to we can
 
01:07:04.269 --> 01:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
certainly check I'm I'm not trying to
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
force it why don't we take a break right
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
here have our lunch come back and then
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
get that spreadsheet and then take
 
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
action and get the other bills
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
going okay is everyone comfortable with
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
the suggestion we're going to recess uh
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
till 1 o'clock for
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
mind

01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:24.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
so but I don't want you
 
01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:39.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:41.799 align:start position:0%
right yeah I don't want I don't want us
 
01:09:41.799 --> 01:09:52.030 align:start position:0%
right yeah I don't want I don't want us

02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead and
 
02:12:53.709 --> 02:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
continue with are our meeting this this
 
02:12:56.350 --> 02:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon with these five bills and
 
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
right now we are looking at H
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
563 and there has been a spreadsheet
 
02:13:04.470 --> 02:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
passed out so everybody can take a
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
gander at that so you and then what I'm
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to do right now I'm going to pass
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
this back to uh repres spillsbury who
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
was chairing that for me seeing that I
 
02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
had introduced this particular Bill
 
02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:18.350 align:start position:0%
had introduced this particular Bill
thank

02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:22.069 --> 02:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
you okay um
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
does everybody have their eye on the
 
02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:27.189 align:start position:0%
does everybody have their eye on the
spreadsheet

02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
02:13:29.709 --> 02:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to just allow for a
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
little bit of Silence if you want to
 
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
look at it for a few minutes and the
 
02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
first person who wants to be recognized
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
get something going representative
 
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
luno I was wondering if we could as a
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
committee walk through the Manchester
 
02:14:16.990 --> 02:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:21.559 align:start position:0%
free so I think a lot of us in the
 
02:14:23.709 --> 02:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
who spent a lot of time on school
 
02:14:25.709 --> 02:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
funding you know feel you know if you're
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
not moving the the needle for Manchester
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
you're not moving the needle Statewide
 
02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
but but Manchester has has a lot of very
 
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
unique um characteristics to it it's
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
it's got the highest number of students
 
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
you know more than any other District
 
02:14:42.669 --> 02:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
it's got the largest number of students
 
02:14:45.229 --> 02:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
that are English language Learners um
 
02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
it's obviously the largest school
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
district in terms of um capacity uh uh
 
02:14:54.189 --> 02:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
it's in a city aren't that many cities
 
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
um so it's got a it's got a large
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
commercial tax base and a and a uh I I'm
 
02:15:03.229 --> 02:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
not sure where Manchester stands uh
 
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
today in terms of equalized valuation
 
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
per pupil uh but but I thought it would
 
02:15:10.350 --> 02:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
be worth going through the line and it's
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
on page four of the of the
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and I don't know Mr chair do
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
you want to sort of take
 
02:15:22.229 --> 02:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
us I I'm very comfortable having you
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
make your observations and focusing on
 
02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester and then we can look for
 
02:15:28.669 --> 02:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
other examples so yeah so thank you very
 
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair so just looking at at um
 
02:15:35.629 --> 02:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
at column B you know um U
 
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
11,394 kids and then you multiply that
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
by the
 
02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
4351 base that brings you to 49.5
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
million is that a good understanding
 
02:15:52.549 --> 02:15:52.559 align:start position:0%
there yep um and then we're in column D
 
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
6,300 kids uh eligible for free and redu
 
02:15:59.709 --> 02:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
price meal I think that's low um based
 
02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
on what we saw in Medicaid direct
 
02:16:03.910 --> 02:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
certification numbers I think um
 
02:16:06.669 --> 02:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester has about a thousand more
 
02:16:09.149 --> 02:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
that would be eligible but regardless so
 
02:16:11.189 --> 02:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
it has the potential to grow it would
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
have the potential to grow but
 
02:16:18.669 --> 02:16:18.679 align:start position:0%
regardless right now 6300 times the
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
2441 um that's up in that you know sort
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
of the row right under the the titles
 
02:16:27.990 --> 02:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
that brings you brings another 15
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
million 15.4 million and the same thing
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
with special education 2500 kids times
 
02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
the the 31 40 and is that the new number
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
M yeah yes okay yes yeah just want to
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
includes both the inflation adjustment
 
02:16:50.190 --> 02:16:50.200 align:start position:0%
and the bump yep yep there it is um so
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
up from 21 100 to
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
3140 um that uh that adds another
 
02:16:59.950 --> 02:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
approximately $8 million onto it um
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
English language Learners and you can
 
02:17:04.709 --> 02:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
see how Manchester dwarfs all the other
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
communities I don't know where Nasha is
 
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
on on um on that line U
 
02:17:15.469 --> 02:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
got 2000
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
2077 so times the English length
 
02:17:24.030 --> 02:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
language learner um um differentiated
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
Factor you got 1.7 million there so so
 
02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
those columns together are the result of
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the the the amendment
 
02:17:37.950 --> 02:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
over the existing law for the cost of an
 
02:17:39.549 --> 02:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
adequate education so the cost of an
 
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
adequate education man us about $75
 
02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
adequate education man us about $75
million

02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.629 align:start position:0%
million
74.8

02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
74.8
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
million um you net out the uh what they
 
02:17:53.070 --> 02:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
collect from the state property tax and
 
02:17:56.429 --> 02:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
that leaves a preliminary Grant from the
 
02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
state of about 55 million so this would
 
02:18:01.349 --> 02:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
be non
 
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
swept non- swept State revenues so this
 
02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
is from the basket of other things right
 
02:18:09.469 --> 02:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
the net that will actually be sent to
 
02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
the district correct correct so 55
 
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
million from the state
 
02:18:18.349 --> 02:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
that in that 55 million
 
02:18:23.589 --> 02:18:23.599 align:start position:0%
that would get sent to the state for
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant there's another
 
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
55.4 million which has nothing to do
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
with what's in column l so column M
 
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
while those numbers look really the same
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
very close they're completely different
 
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
it's a doubling yep and so so column m
 
02:18:43.309 --> 02:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
is the extraordinary needs Grant so this
 
02:18:49.549 --> 02:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
is a grant that begins at 11 and a half
 
02:18:49.559 --> 02:18:51.309 align:start position:0%
is a grant that begins at 11 and a half
11.5

02:18:51.309 --> 02:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
11.5
 
02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
,000 per student in in for equalized
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
property value per pupil in the in a in
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
a fairly large range because now not
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
equalized value per people equalized
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
value per free and red reduced priced
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
meal pupil did I get that right
 
02:19:16.110 --> 02:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
$1,730 per yeah yeah and so that comes
 
02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
out to
 
02:19:20.830 --> 02:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
55.4 million
 
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:19:24.589 --> 02:19:24.599 align:start position:0%
targeted um notice how Manchester
 
02:19:26.589 --> 02:19:26.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't get any of the fiscal capacity
 
02:19:29.709 --> 02:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid which is in column n and
 
02:19:31.389 --> 02:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
that's because Manchester does have a
 
02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
lot of property value has more than the
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
median you know property value which I
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
think is what the the um 1 million to
 
02:19:41.429 --> 02:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
1.6 million range was was looking to
 
02:19:43.950 --> 02:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
capture um so there you got the total
 
02:19:46.709 --> 02:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
adjusted Grant a total adjusted targeted
 
02:19:51.870 --> 02:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
Grant of 55.4 million and then that
 
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
gets uh capped for so this is where the
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
provision on this is the provision that
 
02:20:01.790 --> 02:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative fellos was asking about
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
at the top of the spreadsheet we had in
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
front of us this morning the 3750 and so
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
now we're on page three of the amendment
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
lines 20 line 21 through the end for
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities with a total admr of
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
5,000 or more so only Manchester and
 
02:20:20.110 --> 02:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
Nash are the only ones subtract the
 
02:20:21.630 --> 02:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
amount necess to limit the total
 
02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
additional targeted Aid to 3750 per
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
pupil and so so it takes a a 13 million
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
is $12 million-ish haircut on that gets
 
02:20:36.190 --> 02:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
you to 42 million 42.7 million and
 
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
targeted so you add that to the number
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
in column L right and you get
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
column R which should be the total M GR
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
from from the state and and R is the
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
amount sent from the state and then when
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
swept is added back s is the total
 
02:21:02.429 --> 02:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
correct yep um so so the reason why
 
02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester based on the the you know the
 
02:21:11.110 --> 02:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
comparison um sheet we saw this morning
 
02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh current law FY 26
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
proposed uh formula FY 27 you saw that
 
02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
you saw the grant go down by about $10
 
02:21:25.469 --> 02:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
million and that is largely attributed
 
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
to the um the reduction to their to
 
02:21:33.550 --> 02:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
their um U extraordinary needs Grant and
 
02:21:35.070 --> 02:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh and it's not that full amount because
 
02:21:36.670 --> 02:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
obviously they received additional
 
02:21:39.309 --> 02:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
dollars through through the um uh
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
special education increase that's how I
 
02:21:47.349 --> 02:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I reading that I think that ensures
 
02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
that everybody follows the architecture
 
02:21:51.910 --> 02:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the spreadsheet thank you I would
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
also comment that uh um the fiscal
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid is a new column
 
02:22:00.309 --> 02:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
that you haven't seen in the prior
 
02:22:03.070 --> 02:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets this committee has had and
 
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's column n so that total of 13
 
02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:07.230 align:start position:0%
that's column n so that total of 13
million

02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
364 uh how it breaks out amongst those
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh 40 or so communities can be seen very
 
02:22:17.270 --> 02:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
easily because uh um you can just scan
 
02:22:19.550 --> 02:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
down that list and most of them are
 
02:22:22.270 --> 02:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
blank but those that have a figure are
 
02:22:25.150 --> 02:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
the ones that are benefiting from that
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
element represent papovich Miller thank
 
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
you I would like to very briefly say
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
that um it is only fair to talk about
 
02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
haircut that one
 
02:22:35.800 --> 02:22:37.750 align:start position:0%
haircut that one
1,000

02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
1,000
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
dollar equalized valuation per pupil in
 
02:22:45.389 --> 02:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
1.6 1 million and 1.6 million
 
02:22:48.990 --> 02:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
um representative lad yeah if you look
 
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
on page two of the bill
 
02:22:54.429 --> 02:22:54.439 align:start position:0%
on line 24 you can see the extraordinary
 
02:23:03.469 --> 02:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:06.670 --> 02:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
2% oops so representative
 
02:23:09.550 --> 02:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
luno just on that same on this thread
 
02:23:11.429 --> 02:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
though I think representative fellows
 
02:23:14.349 --> 02:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
makes a makes a good point that that the
 
02:23:16.710 --> 02:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
the floor in the ceiling for that evpp
 
02:23:19.389 --> 02:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
range I'm I'm just catching this as well
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
so on line 10 and 11 instead of simply
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
saying the maximum Grant shall be
 
02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
increased by 2% the wording is the grant
 
02:23:29.429 --> 02:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
floor the grant ceiling and the maximum
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
Grant shall be increased so I think
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's what you're getting at right
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
where are we well no that's that's not
 
02:23:38.429 --> 02:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
what what I was getting at that that um
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
that I think for for the for the
 
02:23:42.429 --> 02:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
purposes of right now and the purposes
 
02:23:45.750 --> 02:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
of a two-year budget that that you know
 
02:23:48.349 --> 02:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
we can probably work within that but it
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
but it should be looked at again in two
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
years years to to be re-calibrated to
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
that median point and that starting
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
point because you might find that Berlin
 
02:24:01.349 --> 02:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
goes from a million uh evpp to
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
1.2 and um and and and so it back in
 
02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
2019 when um when representative lad and
 
02:24:13.830 --> 02:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
I had um designed a um uh a similar
 
02:24:16.990 --> 02:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
project we looked at the range was
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
$600,000 to
 
02:24:22.750 --> 02:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
1 it was either a million or 1.1 million
 
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
it was something like that exactly so so
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
each iteration of the fiscal capacity
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
disparity 8 has taken account of those
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
correct uh increases and I think it's
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
fair to say that uh two years from now
 
02:24:37.950 --> 02:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature will be looking at this
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
again so I guess the suggestion is we
 
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
don't need to get hung up on it two
 
02:24:45.550 --> 02:24:45.560 align:start position:0%
weeks from now keep I
 
02:24:48.990 --> 02:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
me but that that said though um when it
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
does go to when it goes to finance if
 
02:24:54.830 --> 02:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know that that that it it could be
 
02:24:59.190 --> 02:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
possible to to put in some dynamically
 
02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
adjusting you know based on you know a a
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
a median and I mean I think something
 
02:25:06.990 --> 02:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
like that could be cor yes and I I think
 
02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
the laugh to my right was suggesting
 
02:25:11.389 --> 02:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
just that
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative I will um agree that
 
02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
there is a need to continuously
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
recalibrate and we all know that we do
 
02:25:20.309 --> 02:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
look at this every two years whether
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
without fail so I don't think there is a
 
02:25:26.190 --> 02:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
question I would say that if you if you
 
02:25:28.389 --> 02:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
ask me to come up with a way to figure
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
out how to automatically recalibrate it
 
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
in the text of the law so we don't have
 
02:25:35.070 --> 02:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
to do it manually I could not come up
 
02:25:36.750 --> 02:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
with something like that with any degree
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
of confidence so I think while we will
 
02:25:42.590 --> 02:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
look at everything in the next part of
 
02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:44.150 align:start position:0%
look at everything in the next part of
the

02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
process I would still expect that the
 
02:25:48.389 --> 02:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
legislature will keep tuning and
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
figuring out what happens because I
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
don't know of any way to anticipate in a
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
text of law everything that may happen
 
02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of property values disparities
 
02:25:58.349 --> 02:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
Evolutions in various parts of the state
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a guideline which needs to
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
be continuously retweaked and we will
 
02:26:05.469 --> 02:26:05.479 align:start position:0%
continue to do that to the best of our
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
abilities and I would just say uh
 
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
speaking personally that I've seen three
 
02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
or four different iterations of the
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
formula in the last 10
 
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
days and each one has a different
 
02:26:18.429 --> 02:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
outcome for my
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
community that's not as important to me
 
02:26:23.910 --> 02:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
as getting this back into law and
 
02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
getting this mechanism to be a core part
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
of the formula so representative I would
 
02:26:31.950 --> 02:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
just like to add for
 
02:26:35.269 --> 02:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
that um representative Pap's comment
 
02:26:37.630 --> 02:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
that I think I can right off the top of
 
02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
my head think of one way to recalibrate
 
02:26:43.150 --> 02:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
that you just use the median to the
 
02:26:45.070 --> 02:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
median or the average to start with and
 
02:26:50.990 --> 02:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:54.429 --> 02:26:54.439 align:start position:0%
okay good future thought representative
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
Damon so this is possibly right in front
 
02:27:01.710 --> 02:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
of my nose but column o and P the total
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
additional targeted Aid and the adjusted
 
02:27:09.309 --> 02:27:09.319 align:start position:0%
total targeted Aid are 13,000 differ in
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
the total I mean 13
 
02:27:14.469 --> 02:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
million did I overlook where that is
 
02:27:16.950 --> 02:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
because it didn't I didn't find it in

we are not doing thus far this takes us
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
a step in the right direction so that's
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%

02:34:34.110 --> 02:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
chair this amendment to 773 Blends
 
02:34:39.269 --> 02:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
elements that were found in both 773
 
02:34:42.349 --> 02:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative lad's Bill and 742
 
02:34:47.469 --> 02:34:47.479 align:start position:0%
representative luno bill so if I can uh
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
walk you through the amendment
 
02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
um if you have
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
773 uh on your desktop good good to have
 
02:34:58.269 --> 02:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
that open if you have 742 even better
 
02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
both the
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
amendment uh retains the three and a
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
half times average cost threshold it's
 
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
in current law and that and is just to
 
02:35:14.910 --> 02:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
make the numeral
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
clear uh it deletes the the sentence in
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
line 8 through 11 that is in current law
 
02:35:24.670 --> 02:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
and that's the sentence that provides
 
02:35:27.389 --> 02:35:27.399 align:start position:0%
for pration in the event of a shortfall
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
so that's gone it creates a new sentence
 
02:35:34.429 --> 02:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
in lines 11 through
 
02:35:41.309 --> 02:35:41.319 align:start position:0%
15 and uh this concept was in
 
02:35:45.790 --> 02:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
773 but it was uh misplaced in the wrong
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
subsection B so it's been incorporated
 
02:35:52.230 --> 02:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
into uh uh subsection Roman
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
3A and it's also been changed from the
 
02:36:00.950 --> 02:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
figure in 773 was 85% this is
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
80% now obviously the idea is to have an
 
02:36:08.590 --> 02:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation each year that fully funds
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
the commitments made in the formula for
 
02:36:13.309 --> 02:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid but in the event of a
 
02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
short fall this basically U places a
 
02:36:21.510 --> 02:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
floor of 80% says the state will back up
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
at least to
 
02:36:26.750 --> 02:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
80% if there's if it's if there's
 
02:36:28.830 --> 02:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
adequate uh money uh in the
 
02:36:31.469 --> 02:36:31.479 align:start position:0%
appropriation then it could be 100% this
 
02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
just sets a
 
02:36:38.510 --> 02:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
floor um and uh so it moves away from
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
the uh elimination of pration entirely
 
02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
and there could therefore be a
 
02:36:48.030 --> 02:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
pration if the uh appr if the
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation fell short
 
02:36:53.230 --> 02:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
down towards the 80% level and so now on
 
02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:54.230 align:start position:0%
down towards the 80% level and so now on
page

02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:36:57.630 --> 02:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
two the new language found in lines 9
 
02:36:57.640 --> 02:36:58.950 align:start position:0%
two the new language found in lines 9
through

02:36:58.950 --> 02:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:37:03.510 --> 02:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
19 is directly taken from representative
 
02:37:08.389 --> 02:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
luno Bill light wording adjustments from
 
02:37:12.429 --> 02:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
742 and that in turn comes out of the
 
02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
EFA statute and so it provides the same
 
02:37:20.349 --> 02:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
process as for the efas if there's a
 
02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
shortfall um we go to the the governor
 
02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
goes to the education trust fund if the
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is at zero then
 
02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
further goes to the general fund so this
 
02:37:34.990 --> 02:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
commitment so I I think it's been a
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
well-coordinated uh Cooperative uh
 
02:37:45.630 --> 02:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
effort uh with representative luno to
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
take the two parts of the bill and blend
 
02:37:50.269 --> 02:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much represent luno
 
02:37:52.070 --> 02:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
do you have any further
 
02:37:57.150 --> 02:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:00.910 --> 02:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
um I I I I I think the intent of this is
 
02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
is is is right on the right on I would I
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
would certainly have liked to see a
 
02:38:10.830 --> 02:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
higher uh pration floor but 80 is higher
 
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
than zero the floor right now is zero
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
and um and so that's that's the reason
 
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
just looking
 
02:38:27.469 --> 02:38:27.479 align:start position:0%
at how in section one we use the word
 
02:38:28.910 --> 02:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
we've got the word
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation which was um not in the U
 
02:38:35.230 --> 02:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
the 742 Bill we only used a draw of the
 
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
um you've got in section
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
two the words from that draw that rely
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
on the education trust fund
 
02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
um and just wondering if the is is the
 
02:39:03.269 --> 02:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
appropriated is is what's being refer I
 
02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
guess it's question what's being
 
02:39:09.389 --> 02:39:09.399 align:start position:0%
referred to on page one line 11 the
 
02:39:12.790 --> 02:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
amount appropriated is that the same as
 
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
as um what's talked about on line on
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
page two line 10 uh yes the amount
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated for distribution in line 11
 
02:39:27.030 --> 02:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
of page one is the same uh that's being
 
02:39:32.110 --> 02:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
referred to in page two line 10 uh the
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
amount necessary you know is hereby
 
02:39:37.110 --> 02:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
appropriated the same so the draw occurs
 
02:39:41.150 --> 02:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
shortfall right the draw against the
 
02:39:46.429 --> 02:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is a provision for
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
what happens if the appropriation is
 
02:39:50.429 --> 02:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
insufficient to F meet the claims I'm
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
not sure that's true because in in line
 
02:39:56.910 --> 02:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
six on page two Roman 4 the state shall
 
02:39:58.910 --> 02:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate an amount for each fiscal
 
02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
year that's been deleted and so that was
 
02:40:04.990 --> 02:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
the that was the budget appropriation
 
02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
and that's the thing that made it
 
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
susceptible to a shortfall if it's
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
appropriated from the education trust
 
02:40:16.349 --> 02:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:20.349 --> 02:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
shortfall I I I I I think cuz because
 
02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:30.309 --> 02:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
is yes representative McGuire thank you
 
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
so I I think the in this section
 
02:40:35.630 --> 02:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
language makes it clear because both of
 
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:48.429 --> 02:40:48.439 align:start position:0%
186-188 right so I think it's pretty
 
02:40:50.910 --> 02:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
clear that they're the
 
02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
same further
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
discussion representative fellows so um
 
02:41:00.630 --> 02:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
I just had a question about a
 
02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:08.230 --> 02:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
governor's if it's appropriate things
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
that are does it need to be appropriated
 
02:41:14.790 --> 02:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education via a
 
02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
warrant so if
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
I man yes go ahead
 
02:41:22.750 --> 02:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
let's say an appropriation of $50
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
million is
 
02:41:29.389 --> 02:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
made and let's say claims come in at $80
 
02:41:29.399 --> 02:41:31.030 align:start position:0%
made and let's say claims come in at $80
million

02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
so the appropriation is less than
 
02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
80% right so the appropriation is
 
02:41:41.510 --> 02:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
funding the first 50 million and the
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
warrant drawn against the education
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund makes up the Gap from there
 
02:41:52.590 --> 02:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
further

02:41:55.510 --> 02:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:58.429 --> 02:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
discussion not seeing
 
02:42:02.349 --> 02:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
any represent Damon thank
 
02:42:04.670 --> 02:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
you I just want to say that while this
 
02:42:08.110 --> 02:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
is a considerable Improvement in
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
predictability to school districts of
 
02:42:13.630 --> 02:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
coverage of catastrophic special
 
02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:15.309 align:start position:0%
coverage of catastrophic special
education

02:42:15.309 --> 02:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:42:18.790 --> 02:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
costs it still does leave the district
 
02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:20.630 align:start position:0%
costs it still does leave the district
paying

02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
paying
 
02:42:24.429 --> 02:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
more than they expected to but it's
 
02:42:26.510 --> 02:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
certainly an
 
02:42:30.510 --> 02:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
improvement represent yes papich thank
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
you um I hear what you're saying and I
 
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you're acknowledging
 
02:42:37.790 --> 02:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
that this is obviously clear Improvement
 
02:42:40.190 --> 02:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
as a former Finance director of the town
 
02:42:41.550 --> 02:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
obviously not the school district but
 
02:42:44.190 --> 02:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
the concepts are the same if I would see
 
02:42:46.750 --> 02:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
this law I would budget as if I was
 
02:42:49.469 --> 02:42:49.479 align:start position:0%
going to receive 80% and consider
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
anything over 80% to be more or less a
 
02:42:55.269 --> 02:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
winfall so it completely eliminates that
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
negative surprise you can get if a
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
school district is disciplined and
 
02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
budgets accordingly to the minimum they
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
know they will receive then they can
 
02:43:05.349 --> 02:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
only have a pleasant surprise and we
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
will always I want to make that very
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
clear do everything we can to
 
02:43:10.469 --> 02:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate the right amount so this is
 
02:43:14.030 --> 02:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
paid at 100% we've we've always try to
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
do that but the floor being there gives
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
you the absolute certainty that you
 
02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
won't have a negative prise below the
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
floor so you can budget to the floor and
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
then hope you'll get a bit more but
 
02:43:27.469 --> 02:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
you'll you know it we do the best we can
 
02:43:30.269 --> 02:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
in The Current financial situation thank
 
02:43:33.309 --> 02:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
you I I just want to Echo the same thing
 
02:43:35.910 --> 02:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
the objective is not to invite lower
 
02:43:37.950 --> 02:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
Appropriations the presumption is we're
 
02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
going to appropriate what we expect this
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
is only dealing with those situations
 
02:43:47.070 --> 02:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
where there's an a surprise of uh claims
 
02:43:49.830 --> 02:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
that exceed the appropriation
 
02:43:53.110 --> 02:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
and and and I I I think I would also
 
02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
offer the thought that there's been a
 
02:43:58.550 --> 02:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion in this committee that
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going to lose sight of over
 
02:44:03.190 --> 02:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
the question of how to better measure
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
what's going on in U in the special Aid
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
field and I think we will be working
 
02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
towards other ways of trying to improve
 
02:44:15.269 --> 02:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
reporter reporting and data so that uh
 
02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
we can improve upon the law but I think
 
02:44:20.429 --> 02:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
this is what we can do at this stage
 
02:44:20.439 --> 02:44:21.389 align:start position:0%
this is what we can do at this stage
further

02:44:21.389 --> 02:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:44:23.870 --> 02:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
discussion i' like to just add on to
 
02:44:25.950 --> 02:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
what uh reveron spillsbury just said
 
02:44:28.349 --> 02:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
that it's my intention to put together a
 
02:44:31.389 --> 02:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to look at uh how we're
 
02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with special education Aid where
 
02:44:36.830 --> 02:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're getting our data from looking at
 
02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:39.279 align:start position:0%
these IEPs that are written that are in
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
the local school districts to make sure
 
02:44:43.349 --> 02:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
that the expenses
 
02:44:46.510 --> 02:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
parallel uh our requirements for when
 
02:44:48.389 --> 02:44:48.399 align:start position:0%
we're matching it up against a specific
 
02:44:50.790 --> 02:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
category area of of a
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
disability um that we also ensure that
 
02:44:59.429 --> 02:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
um that we
 
02:45:02.830 --> 02:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
can not fall into this Pitfall that
 
02:45:04.349 --> 02:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
we're in right now where we're having
 
02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
68% at pration rate where districts this
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
is the number one issue I've heard from
 
02:45:12.190 --> 02:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
my communities is we're getting hammered
 
02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
on this one and and I I think we all
 
02:45:17.070 --> 02:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
agree and I I just this bill was
 
02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
originally put in by myself
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
and it echoed a bill HB
 
02:45:27.230 --> 02:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
344 dated back in
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
2013 and that's when representative
 
02:45:32.670 --> 02:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
guile and I put together a bill to try
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
to address this issue of pration and it
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
hadn't existed at that time and we
 
02:45:39.710 --> 02:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
didn't do it back then and the language
 
02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
that we together had put in was 80% now
 
02:45:45.870 --> 02:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
I'd love to see 90% or a higher number
 
02:45:49.070 --> 02:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
but I think in in all honesty this is
 
02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
the one which has the best chance of
 
02:45:54.510 --> 02:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
making it through um we do need to
 
02:45:57.309 --> 02:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
address this in even in the light that I
 
02:46:00.990 --> 02:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
am concerned that the monies which we
 
02:46:03.389 --> 02:46:03.399 align:start position:0%
spend on this a school district
 
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't get nailed with an amount
 
02:46:08.950 --> 02:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
which they don't
 
02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
have and I reflect and I've mentioned
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
this committee and for those are new
 
02:46:15.950 --> 02:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
here I have two little town a little
 
02:46:20.830 --> 02:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
town in my district called pymont
 
02:46:22.990 --> 02:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
and they had two of these youngsters
 
02:46:25.830 --> 02:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
come into the school in the same year
 
02:46:28.990 --> 02:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
from outside their school district and
 
02:46:30.110 --> 02:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden they had to provide
 
02:46:31.990 --> 02:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
these Services of course it's based upon
 
02:46:34.870 --> 02:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
previous year's allocation but they had
 
02:46:36.950 --> 02:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
come up with over between the two of
 
02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:38.590 align:start position:0%
come up with over between the two of
over

02:46:38.590 --> 02:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
$250,000 because we all know that the
 
02:46:42.429 --> 02:46:42.439 align:start position:0%
school district's accountable for the
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
first what 96 million that's 70,000 plus
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
that 26 left over between the 20 80% up
 
02:46:53.349 --> 02:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
to 100% and 10 times I mean so it was
 
02:46:56.269 --> 02:46:56.279 align:start position:0%
just very difficult for them and and
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
it's difficult for all communities so uh
 
02:47:02.110 --> 02:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill to me and
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
I think it is for our communities out
 
02:47:06.710 --> 02:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
there but it's not the answer we need to
 
02:47:08.190 --> 02:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
get in there and find out what's going
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
on I mentioned to you before that
 
02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
there's States like Arkansas that one
 
02:47:15.550 --> 02:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
out of every 10 IEPs are audited to
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that they
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
reflect um
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
the the standards for that particular
 
02:47:25.950 --> 02:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
handicapping condition and and they also
 
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
reflect the standards set by the state
 
02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:28.950 align:start position:0%
reflect the standards set by the state
for

02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so thank you very
 
02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:35.359 align:start position:0%

02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
Dr that uh the timing of a full annual
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
cycle was such that it would be
 
02:53:18.830 --> 02:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
difficult to implement this or would
 
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
cause reassessments of uh of what to
 
02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
expect in the communities that already
 
02:53:27.309 --> 02:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
have their FY 26 budgets uh um ready to
 
02:53:30.830 --> 02:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
go to voters so we have an amendment
 
02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
that simply adds oneline
 
02:53:37.190 --> 02:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
applicability that the first swept shall
 
02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
be remitted March 15
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
2027 so the bill takes
 
02:53:46.950 --> 02:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
effect uh July 1st 2025 but the
 
02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
obligation to remit the excess swept
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
amount is deferred to FY 27 and would
 
02:53:55.870 --> 02:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
have to occur by March 15
 
02:53:57.870 --> 02:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
27 further
 
02:54:00.309 --> 02:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
02:54:03.389 --> 02:54:03.399 align:start position:0%
Ames I just think it's important uh to
 
02:54:06.190 --> 02:54:06.200 align:start position:0%
make clear what representative
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
spillsbury really has made clear but I
 
02:54:10.670 --> 02:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
want to underscore it that we're
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
delaying this the
 
02:54:15.070 --> 02:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
effective in effect the
 
02:54:17.670 --> 02:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
effective uh implementation of this
 
02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:18.950 align:start position:0%
effective uh implementation of this
change

02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:54:22.750 --> 02:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
to a point where it can be appropriately
 
02:54:25.070 --> 02:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
implemented not because we're trying to
 
02:54:28.269 --> 02:54:28.279 align:start position:0%
save a little money in the short term
 
02:54:30.190 --> 02:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
that's what I think that needs to be on
 
02:54:31.790 --> 02:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
the record thank
 
02:54:34.349 --> 02:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
you yeah that's correct that that that
 
02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
is correct you know it couldn't be
 
02:54:37.950 --> 02:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
implemented right now seeing that we're
 
02:54:40.910 --> 02:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
going ahead another week or so here for
 
02:54:42.510 --> 02:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
Town meetings and they're already
 
02:54:46.030 --> 02:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
projecting based upon estimations and uh
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
this would cause a huge comp Fusion if
 
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
we put it down for FY 26 I don't think
 
02:54:54.590 --> 02:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's possible to do it without having
 
02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
total chaos out there in the
 
02:55:02.510 --> 02:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:05.469 --> 02:55:05.479 align:start position:0%
discussion okay so we have an amendment
 
02:55:07.389 --> 02:55:07.399 align:start position:0%

chairman so this is a bill that had uh
 
03:00:18.190 --> 03:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
numerous pieces and this amendment
 
03:00:21.229 --> 03:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
reduces it to just one specific one
 
03:00:24.349 --> 03:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
which is um the cap on
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
spending in the local schools school
 
03:00:32.269 --> 03:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
districts um and the cap is
 
03:00:36.389 --> 03:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
um based on um the fiveyear average
 
03:00:39.750 --> 03:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation as changed in the future
 
03:00:42.190 --> 03:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
by um
 
03:00:46.030 --> 03:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
admr and um and also
 
03:00:49.030 --> 03:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
inflation over over again kind of with a
 
03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:51.030 align:start position:0%

5year

03:00:51.030 --> 03:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
5year

smoothing and in general
 
03:01:00.429 --> 03:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
um this addresses um one of the biggest
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh complaints
 
03:01:05.429 --> 03:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
by my constituents and I'm assuming
 
03:01:10.030 --> 03:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
yours as well which is um the the
 
03:01:12.110 --> 03:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
accelerating rate of property
 
03:01:16.710 --> 03:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
taxes um and most of most of which is um
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
the result of of spending in
 
03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
schools um we have schools in the state
 
03:01:26.190 --> 03:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh the average spending in schools is
 
03:01:28.990 --> 03:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
about somewhere between 21 and
 
03:01:32.830 --> 03:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
$22,000 per student but we have we have
 
03:01:36.910 --> 03:01:36.920 align:start position:0%
um schools that spend up near $30,000
 
03:01:38.590 --> 03:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
per student and we have schools that
 
03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
spend under
 
03:01:43.870 --> 03:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
$133,000 per student and there's very
 
03:01:47.389 --> 03:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
little uh correlation between if any
 
03:01:47.399 --> 03:01:48.469 align:start position:0%
little uh correlation between if any
between

03:01:48.469 --> 03:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:01:48.479 --> 03:01:49.269 align:start position:0%
between
um

03:01:49.269 --> 03:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:51.710 --> 03:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
performance and spending there are
 
03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
schools under $133,000 per student that
 
03:01:57.790 --> 03:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
have performances above average and
 
03:02:00.229 --> 03:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
there's schools below there's schools
 
03:02:03.790 --> 03:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
that are above $29,000 per student and
 
03:02:06.630 --> 03:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
and um that have above average
 
03:02:10.269 --> 03:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
performance and their schools below so
 
03:02:12.110 --> 03:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
um there is not necessarily a strong
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
correlation if any between
 
03:02:21.790 --> 03:02:21.800 align:start position:0%
spending and performance but there is
 
03:02:24.790 --> 03:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
between spending and property taxes and
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
so this bill would limit the growth of
 
03:02:34.150 --> 03:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
that spending and therefore limit the
 
03:02:37.030 --> 03:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
growth of property taxes thank you Mr
 
03:02:39.309 --> 03:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
chair further
 
03:02:42.870 --> 03:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
discussion further yes represent luno so
 
03:02:45.269 --> 03:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very very much Mr chair so you
 
03:02:47.469 --> 03:02:47.479 align:start position:0%
know we talked about this um this
 
03:02:50.429 --> 03:02:50.439 align:start position:0%
amendment uh last week when uh when all
 
03:02:51.590 --> 03:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
of a sudden this committee hit the
 
03:02:55.070 --> 03:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
breakes um on it and and it hit the
 
03:02:58.510 --> 03:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
brakes I think because of three um main
 
03:03:01.070 --> 03:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
points and the first one was that it
 
03:03:04.110 --> 03:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
locks in the disparities that uh we have
 
03:03:06.309 --> 03:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
across the state when it comes to access
 
03:03:08.910 --> 03:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
to resources to fund School budgets and
 
03:03:11.590 --> 03:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
we have some school budgets that are
 
03:03:15.710 --> 03:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
that are somewhere in the 15 on on
 
03:03:18.309 --> 03:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
$155,000 um uh per student
 
03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
and we have other school budgets in
 
03:03:21.469 --> 03:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
other towns that are closer to
 
03:03:24.790 --> 03:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
$45,000 per student so and and those
 
03:03:28.309 --> 03:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
School budgets largely are um are are
 
03:03:31.110 --> 03:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
are at those numbers because different
 
03:03:33.590 --> 03:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
cities and towns have different access
 
03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
to resources some are more
 
03:03:37.389 --> 03:03:37.399 align:start position:0%
well-resourced than others a lot of
 
03:03:39.990 --> 03:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
those have very strong budgets others
 
03:03:41.870 --> 03:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
struggle with the highest property taxes
 
03:03:43.870 --> 03:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
in the state and still end up with a
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
budget that doesn't um doesn't do right
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
by their kids that was the first point
 
03:03:50.429 --> 03:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
that was made second point that was made
 
03:03:52.229 --> 03:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
that I think was a very very important
 
03:03:54.110 --> 03:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
point is that what do we what do
 
03:03:55.830 --> 03:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
districts do about special education
 
03:03:58.510 --> 03:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
costs those are an absolute must pay
 
03:04:01.590 --> 03:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
type of um type of item and so so I
 
03:04:03.590 --> 03:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
would offer that since those are must
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
pay and regular education is maybe not
 
03:04:09.150 --> 03:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
must pay then regular education would
 
03:04:13.190 --> 03:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
suffer in districts that don't have um
 
03:04:16.349 --> 03:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
the um the access to the resources that
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh that they need so places like Newport
 
03:04:21.389 --> 03:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
would continue to suffer even more
 
03:04:24.349 --> 03:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
places like Newcastle would uh would not
 
03:04:26.910 --> 03:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
not suffer at all it locks in those
 
03:04:29.110 --> 03:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
inequities um because of the unfair
 
03:04:31.150 --> 03:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
budget landscape because of the special
 
03:04:34.429 --> 03:04:34.439 align:start position:0%
education cost and then finally what
 
03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
type of look is this um you know I we
 
03:04:40.630 --> 03:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to look very far than um than
 
03:04:42.429 --> 03:04:42.439 align:start position:0%
to the K Serge Regional School District
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
and what happened during the first week
 
03:04:46.389 --> 03:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
of January when there was a budget cap
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
local budget cap um on the in their
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
deliberative session and they had U over
 
03:04:52.910 --> 03:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
1,200 people show up for the
 
03:04:55.349 --> 03:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
deliberative session 1,200 I think voted
 
03:04:57.950 --> 03:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
against it and 100 um for it and they
 
03:05:00.630 --> 03:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
rejected that budget cap by an
 
03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelming sentiment of the Comm
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
community so so from my the what the
 
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
public is saying is they're rejecting
 
03:05:10.710 --> 03:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
that budget cap and I'll tell you um
 
03:05:12.309 --> 03:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire you talked about
 
03:05:14.309 --> 03:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
a strong correlation well I'll tell you
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
there's no correlation between what you
 
03:05:18.870 --> 03:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
just said about what your constituents
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh are doing and what your constituent
 
03:05:24.269 --> 03:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
actually did to uh to reject the budget
 
03:05:29.070 --> 03:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
cap in um uh in Epsom so so I you know I
 
03:05:31.950 --> 03:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
think this is very shortsighted I think
 
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
this is very unfair I think there could
 
03:05:37.750 --> 03:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
be a time there could be a time when uh
 
03:05:40.030 --> 03:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
when this type of thing uh when a when a
 
03:05:42.870 --> 03:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
budget cap could be looked at but first
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
we have to fix Scare Fair school funding
 
03:05:47.670 --> 03:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
so that we at least put every school
 
03:05:51.389 --> 03:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
District in on on on a on a on an equal
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
playing field uh where uh where they
 
03:05:55.830 --> 03:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
have access to the resources they need
 
03:05:57.309 --> 03:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
so that they can have the budgets that
 
03:05:59.469 --> 03:05:59.479 align:start position:0%
they need rather than locking them in
 
03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much further
 
03:06:02.269 --> 03:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative Pap I just wanted to uh
 
03:06:08.429 --> 03:06:08.439 align:start position:0%
thank my colleague from hopkington for
 
03:06:09.790 --> 03:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
03:06:12.590 --> 03:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
know recapping the discussion we had
 
03:06:14.510 --> 03:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
last week which was a reasonably
 
03:06:17.309 --> 03:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
accurate recap of the discussion and
 
03:06:20.830 --> 03:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
also Al for bringing up the fact that um
 
03:06:20.840 --> 03:06:22.750 align:start position:0%
also Al for bringing up the fact that um
a

03:06:22.750 --> 03:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:06:25.550 --> 03:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
66% requirement to override the cap
 
03:06:28.750 --> 03:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
which is built into the law can easily B
 
03:06:31.750 --> 03:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
surpass because Kar shows us that they
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
were what over 90% in favor of the point
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make is that when there is
 
03:06:40.269 --> 03:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
a clear need because we've been behind
 
03:06:42.190 --> 03:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
and now our properties are coming up and
 
03:06:44.190 --> 03:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
we can increase the budget more when
 
03:06:45.910 --> 03:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
special education things grow
 
03:06:47.990 --> 03:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly and they are trying to
 
03:06:50.349 --> 03:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
crowd out part of the regular
 
03:06:52.630 --> 03:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
education the town has a very
 
03:06:55.870 --> 03:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
straightforward Escape valve of 66% that
 
03:06:58.790 --> 03:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
they can trigger and the current data is
 
03:07:00.590 --> 03:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
that every vote that rejected the
 
03:07:02.550 --> 03:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
spending cap did pretty much by a much
 
03:07:04.990 --> 03:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
larger margin and 66% so the relief
 
03:07:07.389 --> 03:07:07.399 align:start position:0%
mechanism is perfectly adequate and it
 
03:07:09.429 --> 03:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
allows towns to address those very
 
03:07:11.070 --> 03:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns that are being
 
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
brought up we are leaving it to the
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
towns to decide we are just making it a
 
03:07:18.670 --> 03:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
bit more difficult to keep increasing
 
03:07:21.309 --> 03:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
the taxes and the expenses the way it's
 
03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
done right now thank you further
 
03:07:25.229 --> 03:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
discussion representa
 
03:07:28.110 --> 03:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr
 
03:07:31.309 --> 03:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
chair I'm vigorously opposed to this
 
03:07:34.429 --> 03:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
bill as noted it is perpetuating the
 
03:07:36.630 --> 03:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
existing very significant inequities
 
03:07:39.830 --> 03:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
between funding and districts now this
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
is the absence of a thoughtful
 
03:07:43.389 --> 03:07:43.399 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach to managing
 
03:07:46.269 --> 03:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
education spending districts already
 
03:07:49.190 --> 03:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
have the option to vote in in a cap a
 
03:07:51.229 --> 03:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
number of districts have voted down caps
 
03:07:54.429 --> 03:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
this year in a resounding way why are we
 
03:07:56.550 --> 03:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
talking about taking away their local
 
03:07:59.229 --> 03:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
control that we forever emphasizing on
 
03:07:59.239 --> 03:08:00.710 align:start position:0%
control that we forever emphasizing on
other

03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
things and I think to believe that it is
 
03:08:04.160 --> 03:08:04.990 align:start position:0%
things and I think to believe that it is
a

03:08:04.990 --> 03:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:08:09.150 --> 03:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable easy thing to achieve a 66%
 
03:08:12.910 --> 03:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
majority it is in no way easy I was part
 
03:08:15.630 --> 03:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
of that effort in karge I was a leader
 
03:08:18.269 --> 03:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
of the effort in cuden 3 years ago
 
03:08:21.750 --> 03:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
it takes a remarkable amount of time
 
03:08:23.790 --> 03:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
energy Grassroots democracy
 
03:08:26.670 --> 03:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
communication and there is no guarantee
 
03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
it's way too high of a hurdle does not
 
03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:32.840 align:start position:0%

representative

03:08:35.389 --> 03:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:08:38.429 --> 03:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
fellows yes I would I can't support this
 
03:08:41.870 --> 03:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
another reason is that it's um on line
 
03:08:45.150 --> 03:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
16 of the first page one of the reasons
 
03:08:48.070 --> 03:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
to have a cap one of the
 
03:08:51.670 --> 03:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
measures for the cap is the percentage
 
03:08:54.269 --> 03:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
change in the
 
03:08:57.429 --> 03:08:57.439 align:start position:0%
admr um if a school
 
03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
district's admr drops
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
5% they C you they're not going to be
 
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
able to cut the budget in a way that
 
03:09:09.429 --> 03:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
reflects that because you can't take a
 
03:09:13.269 --> 03:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
teacher and cut 5% of a teacher from a
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
classroom this um it's just not an
 
03:09:18.429 --> 03:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate measure to use
 
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
um if if you did happen to think there
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
were some measures that you could use to
 
03:09:26.429 --> 03:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
um control the budget which I don't I
 
03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
think it's a local
 
03:09:30.349 --> 03:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
issue further
 
03:09:33.670 --> 03:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
discussion yes represent luno so so
 
03:09:35.710 --> 03:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
thanks very much you know I I really
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
question why why you know this is needed
 
03:09:43.670 --> 03:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
and um and you know what back um
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
back four years ago the um the educ
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program was touted as
 
03:09:51.150 --> 03:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
something that was going to save
 
03:09:53.389 --> 03:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money so why isn't that
 
03:09:56.190 --> 03:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
getting the job done wouldn't I mean
 
03:09:58.110 --> 03:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
that was the whole excuse for bringing
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
vouchers in that it was going to reduce
 
03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
the burden on local property taxpayers
 
03:10:04.750 --> 03:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
apparently that hasn't happened um so
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for other ways to
 
03:10:09.469 --> 03:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
somehow shut out our local property
 
03:10:12.750 --> 03:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers from being able to decide what
 
03:10:14.670 --> 03:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
they want to spend on their their public
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
schools and how they want to support
 
03:10:19.550 --> 03:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
their kids I I think this is just a this
 
03:10:22.269 --> 03:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
is a Draconian measure forward it's a
 
03:10:24.469 --> 03:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
terrible measure and it's it's just part
 
03:10:27.150 --> 03:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
of a continued um series of I think
 
03:10:29.950 --> 03:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
failed attempts to uh to not do right by
 
03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:31.269 align:start position:0%

03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I just want to reiterate I
 
03:10:39.550 --> 03:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
think I said this last week when we
 
03:10:42.469 --> 03:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
talked about it but it's been said but I
 
03:10:45.950 --> 03:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
it uh needs to be underscored that
 
03:10:48.429 --> 03:10:48.439 align:start position:0%
essentially this
 
03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
will not quite freeze in but just about
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
lock in the inequities that we have in
 
03:10:59.429 --> 03:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
this system and uh it seems to me that
 
03:11:02.510 --> 03:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
our the first job that we have that
 
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
we're all struggling with
 
03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
is is addressing those inequities in an
 
03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
affirmative way not through some
 
03:11:15.510 --> 03:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
arbitrary cap arbitrary system that's uh
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
hard to navigate and uh that uh takes
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
enormous effort when people are opposed
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
or for uh one a particular cap in a
 
03:11:28.229 --> 03:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
particular Town it just diverts all that
 
03:11:32.670 --> 03:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
energy and our energy and uh whatever uh
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
abilities we have should be funneled
 
03:11:39.910 --> 03:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
into making for a better uh funding
 
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
system for the entire Public School

mahagan thank you Mr chairman I I want
 
03:11:54.510 --> 03:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
to express my gratitude to um
 
03:11:56.510 --> 03:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative luno for articulating my
 
03:12:00.389 --> 03:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
own uh misgivings as as I expressed it
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
last Friday because you did better than
 
03:12:05.229 --> 03:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
I did um but I want to say why I've come
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
across at this I believe that we're at a
 
03:12:09.389 --> 03:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
time in this state of absolute crisis
 
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
where special ed increase goes up
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
uncontrolled every single year at in my
 
03:12:18.429 --> 03:12:18.439 align:start position:0%
town 28% each year some has to be done
 
03:12:21.030 --> 03:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
and I I don't see this as a stop Gap
 
03:12:24.269 --> 03:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
measure I I see this as a as a as an act
 
03:12:27.750 --> 03:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
of almost fiscal War saying it can't go
 
03:12:30.150 --> 03:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
on like this we have to do something on
 
03:12:32.590 --> 03:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
the state level where we've reached a
 
03:12:34.910 --> 03:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
point where this can't continue and I
 
03:12:36.269 --> 03:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
think that this is something that's
 
03:12:38.590 --> 03:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate and temporary I don't see
 
03:12:40.750 --> 03:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
this as an absolute answer I certainly
 
03:12:43.550 --> 03:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
is not a bandage but it is saying we've
 
03:12:46.429 --> 03:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
had enough the taxpayers in my town have
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
had enough another 12% increase it's
 
03:12:50.670 --> 03:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
going to it's going
 
03:12:53.830 --> 03:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
to it's going to be untenable with the
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
people of my town and so we actually
 
03:12:59.229 --> 03:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
have to say looking at what the problem
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
is we're going to have to make a motion
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
that stops IT this is an extreme measure
 
03:13:06.070 --> 03:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
but I see it as something temporary and
 
03:13:08.750 --> 03:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
important for it today further
 
03:13:11.389 --> 03:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
discussion resent
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you again Mr
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
chair with respect to the
 
03:13:19.710 --> 03:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative's most recent
 
03:13:22.229 --> 03:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
remarks absolutely concur that this is a
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
very extreme
 
03:13:27.830 --> 03:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
measure and I believe it is a profound
 
03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
mistake to take an extreme action when
 
03:13:34.190 --> 03:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
we can see the severe consequences right
 
03:13:37.429 --> 03:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
in front of us districts are mandated to
 
03:13:39.710 --> 03:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
provide the special education services
 
03:13:41.830 --> 03:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
that children
 
03:13:47.229 --> 03:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
require so if this cap is in place and
 
03:13:49.429 --> 03:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
Leed costs increase and we all agree
 
03:13:51.269 --> 03:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
that we need to work on better
 
03:13:52.269 --> 03:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that and I'm really
 
03:13:53.269 --> 03:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear we'll have a
 
03:13:55.510 --> 03:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee addressing
 
03:13:58.389 --> 03:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
that but when special ed costs go up in
 
03:14:00.590 --> 03:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
a district with a budget cap the
 
03:14:02.309 --> 03:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
students who are not receiving special
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
ed services are going to be the
 
03:14:06.750 --> 03:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
underfunded ones and if you are already
 
03:14:10.910 --> 03:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
in a district where the cost per student
 
03:14:14.670 --> 03:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
is on the lower end of things the 15 17
 
03:14:14.680 --> 03:14:17.830 align:start position:0%
is on the lower end of things the 15 17
$199,000

03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:20.950 --> 03:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
those students are going to be penalized
 
03:14:23.710 --> 03:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
by this in a very severe
 
03:14:26.790 --> 03:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
way that is simply not fair and
 
03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
Equitable all our students deserve
 
03:14:32.190 --> 03:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
quality education and this does not
 
03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:33.990 align:start position:0%
quality education and this does not
facilitate

03:14:33.990 --> 03:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
facilitate
 
03:14:36.469 --> 03:14:36.479 align:start position:0%

the Federal Register would be increased
 
03:42:29.110 --> 03:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
to 400% for FY
 
03:42:32.950 --> 03:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
26 after June 30
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
2026 there' be no income threshold need
 
03:42:38.830 --> 03:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
be met in subsequent years for K through
 
03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
12 so it basically is 400% for the first
 
03:42:47.349 --> 03:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
year FY 26 fy2 seven the the uh EFA
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
program becomes
 
03:42:52.469 --> 03:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
Universal uh any any student who's a
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
resident meets other other other
 
03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
qualifications in the statute uh May
 
03:43:00.990 --> 03:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
participate in the EFA program that's
 
03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
it okay further discussion on the
 
03:43:08.429 --> 03:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
amendment representative luno so thanks
 
03:43:13.510 --> 03:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
very much um for uh for both those
 
03:43:20.950 --> 03:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
um periods FY um 26 and FY 27 do you uh
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
have a um a fiscal note and an estimate
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the number of uh of U efas that would
 
03:43:32.269 --> 03:43:32.279 align:start position:0%
be um uh open or the number of students
 
03:43:39.189 --> 03:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
helpful I representative lad
 
03:44:03.469 --> 03:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
03:44:09.630 --> 03:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the first year of going
 
03:44:11.670 --> 03:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
up to
 
03:44:15.070 --> 03:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
400% I I don't see a steep climb in St
 
03:44:16.349 --> 03:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
students that are going to be doing that
 
03:44:18.149 --> 03:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
seeing that most of the students which
 
03:44:23.070 --> 03:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
are coming from households that uh we're
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
talking about 185 to you know 30
 
03:44:30.750 --> 03:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
130% uh down to that is free and reduced
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
and so we're talking about few kids
 
03:44:34.910 --> 03:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
coming additional see we're only upping
 
03:44:38.110 --> 03:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
by 50% in the second year uh we're
 
03:44:40.030 --> 03:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
opening up to all and that includes
 
03:44:41.550 --> 03:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
those that are in private schools right
 
03:44:43.030 --> 03:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
now and that's
 
03:44:49.149 --> 03:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
approximately um 1, 1400 students in our
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
state excuse me excuse me um de did
 
03:44:54.110 --> 03:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
number of students in New Hampshire
 
03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
non-public schools is
 
03:44:55.680 --> 03:44:57.389 align:start position:0%
non-public schools is
17,6

03:44:57.389 --> 03:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
17,6
 
03:44:59.590 --> 03:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
70 that's the number of students of
 
03:45:03.149 --> 03:45:03.159 align:start position:0%
which I see 9,000 of those not eligible
 
03:45:05.790 --> 03:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
for EFA seeing that they are
 
03:45:08.429 --> 03:45:08.439 align:start position:0%
non-residents of this state that are
 
03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
attending private schools to the
 
03:45:10.439 --> 03:45:12.429 align:start position:0%
attending private schools to the
24,990

03:45:12.429 --> 03:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
24,990
 
03:45:15.750 --> 03:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
students and
 
03:45:18.189 --> 03:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
wait hold on hold on I was recognized
 
03:45:19.750 --> 03:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
represent is
 
03:45:22.189 --> 03:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
speaking and we also have some students
 
03:45:24.510 --> 03:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
that are already in the uh in the
 
03:45:27.189 --> 03:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
program and the preschool population
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
which is not eligible is around 1500
 
03:45:32.189 --> 03:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
students so and in looking at that I can
 
03:45:34.429 --> 03:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
see that you I I would subtract out
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
those 9,000 students which are not
 
03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
eligible uh uh seeing that I've just
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned why uh we're we're talking
 
03:45:44.510 --> 03:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
much less I know that there's been some
 
03:45:47.309 --> 03:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
that say it's going to be $100 million
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to cost us um I I I think
 
03:45:52.950 --> 03:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's incorrect very incorrect as we're
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
talking about thousands of ineligible
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
preschool students out of state students
 
03:45:58.349 --> 03:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about students already
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
in the EA program and we're assuming
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
every eligible student would take an EFA
 
03:46:05.149 --> 03:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
and that's not the case and it's never
 
03:46:06.870 --> 03:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
been the case in any state that's had
 
03:46:10.429 --> 03:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
EFA programs so I think the figures are
 
03:46:12.269 --> 03:46:12.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely blown out of proportion here
 
03:46:14.670 --> 03:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of those the cost you say this
 
03:46:17.670 --> 03:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
PR is going to cost the average cost per
 
03:46:19.950 --> 03:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
pupil uh state federal and local
 
03:46:23.189 --> 03:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
spending is around $26,000 while EA
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
average costs around
 
03:46:29.070 --> 03:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
$5,200 I see a huge savings there um and
 
03:46:31.149 --> 03:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
and further average State adequacy
 
03:46:33.630 --> 03:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy education grant funding for FY
 
03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
24 was
 
03:46:40.950 --> 03:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:43.510 --> 03:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
$524 I don't see this as a program
 
03:46:46.990 --> 03:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to cost regor education uh
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
any kind of uh issue in terms of funding
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
streams Etc um at the very very maximum
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
the maximum it could cost would be about
 
03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
$1 million in the second year when we
 
03:47:02.110 --> 03:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
open up uh to um
 
03:47:02.120 --> 03:47:03.910 align:start position:0%
open up uh to um
Universal

03:47:03.910 --> 03:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
so few facts you have follow up on that
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative so thank you very
 
03:47:11.110 --> 03:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
much so uh so we've had the voucher
 
03:47:15.950 --> 03:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
program in place since um uh 20 uh
 
03:47:22.630 --> 03:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh 21 22 23 no 22 fy22 23 and 24 and and
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
we're in the fourth year uh of it right
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
now um it uh it I think in in
 
03:47:32.469 --> 03:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
fy2 it has a cost to the state of about
 
03:47:32.479 --> 03:47:35.510 align:start position:0%
fy2 it has a cost to the state of about
$27

03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.670 --> 03:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
million approximately is that is that
 
03:47:41.950 --> 03:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
right and um and so so given the fact
 
03:47:44.830 --> 03:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
that you're estimating far less but but
 
03:47:47.070 --> 03:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
significant savings I was wondering what
 
03:47:49.469 --> 03:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
what savings can you point to in terms
 
03:47:52.030 --> 03:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
of local taxpayers in terms of what the
 
03:47:54.229 --> 03:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
program currently costing the state $27
 
03:47:57.309 --> 03:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
million how has that resulted in savings
 
03:47:59.429 --> 03:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
at the local level to date we've got
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:06.510 --> 03:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
data is that a question for me yes a
 
03:48:10.750 --> 03:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
question representative lad you care to
 
03:48:13.070 --> 03:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
answer I think we're never going to get
 
03:48:15.550 --> 03:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
to where we're all on board on this I
 
03:48:17.550 --> 03:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
believe very strongly that there's a lot
 
03:48:19.990 --> 03:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
more to the EFA program than you're
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
trying to drive at these costs here I
 
03:48:23.830 --> 03:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
think you're looking at students that
 
03:48:26.670 --> 03:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
have not been successful in their
 
03:48:28.750 --> 03:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
current situation as far as learning in
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
the schools they may be resident of uh
 
03:48:35.389 --> 03:48:35.399 align:start position:0%
having this Choice allows them to the
 
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility to have programs where
 
03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're not being bullied they're having
 
03:48:43.349 --> 03:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh learn in a way
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's more uh uh appropriate for their
 
03:48:47.950 --> 03:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
learning style with a teaching style
 
03:48:50.110 --> 03:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for them there's all
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of reasons why this program has
 
03:48:55.030 --> 03:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
been successful and I think the success
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
is measured by the data that we're
 
03:48:58.590 --> 03:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
getting out of the children's
 
03:49:01.630 --> 03:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund in terms of the testing
 
03:49:03.790 --> 03:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
which they're doing the portfolios that
 
03:49:07.670 --> 03:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
they're H having and you I hear
 
03:49:10.189 --> 03:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
oftentimes why aren't you testing all
 
03:49:12.590 --> 03:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
these kids well we don't do that in the
 
03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
public school system K through k through
 
03:49:17.070 --> 03:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
two there is no Statewide achievement
 
03:49:20.070 --> 03:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
test at all the achievements that start
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
tests start in grades three and going
 
03:49:23.950 --> 03:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
upwards in up through 8th grade and then
 
03:49:26.469 --> 03:49:26.479 align:start position:0%
once in 11th grade there's more
 
03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
accountability I believe and what I see
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the EFA program that I've seen in
 
03:49:33.229 --> 03:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
some public
 
03:49:35.590 --> 03:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
schools in some Public Schools where we
 
03:49:37.710 --> 03:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
see the proficiency level in mathematics
 
03:49:40.870 --> 03:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
so very very low the proficiency scores
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
and language arts being so low why would
 
03:49:47.110 --> 03:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
anybody then want their 9-year-old child
 
03:49:49.510 --> 03:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to a fourth grade in a school
 
03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
where that proficiency is at that level
 
03:49:55.950 --> 03:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
they're looking for options and I think
 
03:49:57.389 --> 03:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
that's what we got to be looking at we
 
03:49:59.670 --> 03:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
got to look what is the best fit for the
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
child it goes back to all the things
 
03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
we've done with education tuition uh uh
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
programs to uh open enrollment programs
 
03:50:11.070 --> 03:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
to all the areas that we've gone as far
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
as alternative education there's
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
rationale reasoning for it I would hope
 
03:50:18.830 --> 03:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
that the education Choice programs are
 
03:50:22.710 --> 03:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
showing that this these programs are are
 
03:50:25.229 --> 03:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
making or creating more competition
 
03:50:27.750 --> 03:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
between the public schools say hey we're
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
going to have to elevate our product
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
that we're putting
 
03:50:34.469 --> 03:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
out and and uh so there there'll be it
 
03:50:35.830 --> 03:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to answer your question in
 
03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
terms of dollars and cents I'm I'm
 
03:50:39.670 --> 03:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
answering in terms of what is best for
 
03:50:43.189 --> 03:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
the child and the parent and Mr chair so
 
03:50:45.510 --> 03:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
I I I had a couple questions but I would
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
like to get a comment um in so so go
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
ahead U thank you thank you very much Mr
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
chair So currently at um at the when the
 
03:50:59.070 --> 03:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
when the program started at
 
03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
300% I think in the second year the
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
program Drew about $13 million in state
 
03:51:07.710 --> 03:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
funds um it went to
 
03:51:12.149 --> 03:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
350% and then and then Drew $27 million
 
03:51:15.910 --> 03:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
in in state funds so going to 400% I
 
03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
would expect at least that that level of
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
of increment in the um in the first year
 
03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
so now I want to swing it into um into
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
the second year that um that there are
 
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
according to the Department of Education
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh the number of New Hampshire students
 
03:51:34.590 --> 03:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
attending private schools non-public
 
03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:45.670 --> 03:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
16,640 N1 adding both those two numbers
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
together and multiplying by what um what
 
03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative lad said the average uh
 
03:51:53.590 --> 03:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
voucher of $5,200 comes out to
 
03:51:56.990 --> 03:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
approximately $102 million so I think
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually
 
03:52:02.070 --> 03:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
reasonably um arrived at uh cost
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
assessment for this now I want to talk
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
about the kids who are actually leaving
 
03:52:08.349 --> 03:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
the public schools that's some
 
03:52:11.309 --> 03:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
information believe it or not that that
 
03:52:13.229 --> 03:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
you can actually get from the Department
 
03:52:16.030 --> 03:52:16.040 align:start position:0%
of Education cuz thankfully we had these
 
03:52:18.990 --> 03:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
things called phase out grants that uh
 
03:52:21.670 --> 03:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
that provided State dollars back to
 
03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
public schools for every student that um
 
03:52:27.030 --> 03:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
that left and when you look at the phase
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
out grants it becomes pretty clear that
 
03:52:34.110 --> 03:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
fewer than 5% of the uh of the students
 
03:52:35.950 --> 03:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
um in the education Freedom account
 
03:52:39.070 --> 03:52:39.080 align:start position:0%
program actually left their their public
 
03:52:42.469 --> 03:52:42.479 align:start position:0%
school to take a voucher um and to seek
 
03:52:45.429 --> 03:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
some alternative to their their public
 
03:52:49.630 --> 03:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
school what frankly um has me puzzled
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
right now is why on the children's
 
03:52:55.710 --> 03:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund um um FY
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
24990 so this is the the the non-taxable
 
03:53:01.670 --> 03:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
entity filing that every
 
03:53:04.149 --> 03:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
501c3 has to file with the uh with the
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
federal government they show that they
 
03:53:09.030 --> 03:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
owe the state um back the state of New
 
03:53:11.149 --> 03:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a million almost a million
 
03:53:13.910 --> 03:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars in refunds and um I'm wondering
 
03:53:17.189 --> 03:53:17.199 align:start position:0%
if those are from closed um EFA accounts
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
after a student has left their public
 
03:53:21.710 --> 03:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
school and then realized oh this wasn't
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
a good decision and um and and go back
 
03:53:26.710 --> 03:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
into their public school because I think
 
03:53:29.349 --> 03:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
that's one of the one of the the reasons
 
03:53:29.359 --> 03:53:30.070 align:start position:0%
that's one of the one of the the reasons
why

03:53:30.070 --> 03:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
why
 
03:53:33.790 --> 03:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
efas uh can be closed so you know so I
 
03:53:36.550 --> 03:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
think a a really careful analysis on
 
03:53:39.030 --> 03:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
this shows and and very well-reasoned
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
analysis based on the Doe's own numbers
 
03:53:44.229 --> 03:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
is that is that the program in the first
 
03:53:48.309 --> 03:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
year year would would see at least um um
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
15 most likely 20 million so this is FY
 
03:53:56.510 --> 03:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
26 um uh$ 15 to20 million increase in um
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
in state costs uh based on students who
 
03:54:02.070 --> 03:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
are largely already attending um private
 
03:54:05.189 --> 03:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
schools that in the second year when the
 
03:54:08.070 --> 03:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
when the income limit is completely
 
03:54:14.349 --> 03:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
,000 Plus in homeschools would be
 
03:54:20.070 --> 03:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
eligible that that would go um up to 102
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
million and and frankly based on the
 
03:54:25.750 --> 03:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
program's history hardly anybody is
 
03:54:27.870 --> 03:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
leaving their Public Schools uh to take
 
03:54:31.950 --> 03:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
a voucher and um and and I I think even
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
a good percentage of those appear to be
 
03:54:36.990 --> 03:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
returning to their Public Schools given
 
03:54:38.830 --> 03:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
the liability that the children schol
 
03:54:40.710 --> 03:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
the nearly million dollar liability that
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship has to the state
 
03:54:46.110 --> 03:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
03:54:49.030 --> 03:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellas did you
 
03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
have your hand up yes u i just since
 
03:54:55.149 --> 03:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
representative lad didn't want to
 
03:54:58.269 --> 03:54:58.279 align:start position:0%
respond with the numbers I just thought
 
03:55:01.630 --> 03:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
I might share my thoughts on that I
 
03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
frequently hear the average expenditure
 
03:55:07.550 --> 03:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
per pupil which is about
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
$23,000 come up as a comparison to the
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
cost of a voucher and they have nothing
 
03:55:17.469 --> 03:55:17.479 align:start position:0%
to do with each other I think many many
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
people in the public think that somehow
 
03:55:24.110 --> 03:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
the state or school districts are saving
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
the difference between those two numbers
 
03:55:28.750 --> 03:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
and that's totally not
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
true the difference the comparison
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
that's happening that should be
 
03:55:37.269 --> 03:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
considered is that whatever is paid out
 
03:55:41.149 --> 03:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
in a voucher is an expenditure by the
 
03:55:45.309 --> 03:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
state and if that student came from a
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
school district then then some amount of
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
money which could be anything from 0 to
 
03:56:01.030 --> 03:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
$133,000 could be subtracted from the
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
state adequacy Grant going to the
 
03:56:06.750 --> 03:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
community that that student came from
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
and those are the two comparisons there
 
03:56:12.990 --> 03:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
is no savings going on it costs the
 
03:56:15.870 --> 03:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
state money if there if the students
 
03:56:20.910 --> 03:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
coming from a public school it's that um
 
03:56:24.630 --> 03:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
municipality is could be losing money so
 
03:56:27.710 --> 03:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
this is not a win-win for anybody except
 
03:56:30.910 --> 03:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
for the people many of whom have high
 
03:56:34.349 --> 03:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
incomes that would be receiving these
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
vouchers thank you um we have several
 
03:56:39.070 --> 03:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
comments here I'll take them in order
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
representative papich Muller and
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative dry and representative
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
 thank you I uh just wanted to make
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
sure that we
 
03:56:52.030 --> 03:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
um all understand what a voucher is
 
03:56:53.910 --> 03:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
especially for the members of the public
 
03:56:55.910 --> 03:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
that may be watching these proceedings a
 
03:56:57.870 --> 03:56:57.880 align:start position:0%
voucher is a payment directly from the
 
03:56:59.790 --> 03:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
state to wherever the money is being
 
03:57:02.950 --> 03:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
paid the efas are not vouchers now I
 
03:57:04.830 --> 03:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
cannot stop anybody from calling them
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
vouchers we have the right to call
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
anything we want anything we want but if
 
03:57:11.469 --> 03:57:11.479 align:start position:0%
we use the generally accepted definition
 
03:57:13.510 --> 03:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
of voucher this does not apply to the
 
03:57:17.149 --> 03:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
EFA are payments to the parent the
 
03:57:18.990 --> 03:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
parent then can use those funds they
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
receive from the state to pay for any
 
03:57:23.830 --> 03:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
qualified educational expenses the huge
 
03:57:25.590 --> 03:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
difference in this case is that the
 
03:57:28.670 --> 03:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
state does not pay for that you know
 
03:57:31.030 --> 03:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
whatever educational expense the state
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
pays the parent the parent then decides
 
03:57:36.070 --> 03:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
to pay somebody else this has a
 
03:57:39.149 --> 03:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
huge it has a huge impact in terms of
 
03:57:42.269 --> 03:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
legal understanding of what the term is
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
and again I would not use the word
 
03:57:47.309 --> 03:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
vouchers to go forward but I will not
 
03:57:49.309 --> 03:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
object to my colleagues continuing to
 
03:57:51.309 --> 03:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
use it thank
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
you representative JY thank you very
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
much I think you seriously underestimate
 
03:58:00.790 --> 03:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
the homeschooling Community when you
 
03:58:03.469 --> 03:58:03.479 align:start position:0%
assume that all 3,000 of them would jump
 
03:58:05.790 --> 03:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
at a chance to get an EFA they haven't
 
03:58:07.830 --> 03:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
jumped now and I don't think they will
 
03:58:10.830 --> 03:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
jump later it's not a monolith and I
 
03:58:12.550 --> 03:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
think we do disrespect to the
 
03:58:14.269 --> 03:58:14.279 align:start position:0%
independent thinking of homeschoolers to
 
03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
think that we would all Run and Jump
 
03:58:18.670 --> 03:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
after that immediately as a
 
03:58:22.510 --> 03:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
group representative Cen just
 
03:58:26.189 --> 03:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
exp thank you Mr chair I if I could I
 
03:58:28.110 --> 03:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
would just like to ask um representative
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
luno for some clarification if I
 
03:58:32.910 --> 03:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly you said the
 
03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
phase out grants um and how many
 
03:58:38.429 --> 03:58:38.439 align:start position:0%
students have left is fewer than 5% was
 
03:58:41.149 --> 03:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
that fewer than 5% of the state total of
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
of students no it's fewer than 5% % of
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
of students with um uh in the voucher
 
03:58:51.670 --> 03:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
program it's far fewer than 5% of the
 
03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
number of students in the state okay I
 
03:58:55.910 --> 03:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
mean there's 160,000 students in the
 
03:58:58.030 --> 03:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
state so five correct I wanted
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
clarification to understand what you
 
03:59:01.389 --> 03:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
were referring to thank
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
you U I would just suggest there's a lot
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
of facts a lot of uh statistics and data
 
03:59:12.070 --> 03:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
and it's very hard in a public forum
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
like this to anchor down what real um I
 
03:59:19.710 --> 03:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh I think we've heard there's
 
03:59:23.429 --> 03:59:23.439 align:start position:0%
potentially 177,000 students we've heard
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
X thousands of of them are out of state
 
03:59:29.309 --> 03:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
or not eligible Etc so I think everyone
 
03:59:31.910 --> 03:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
has done their homework coming to this
 
03:59:34.830 --> 03:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
session today and you've got your own
 
03:59:36.670 --> 03:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of what those tradeoffs
 
03:59:40.110 --> 03:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
are and I don't think uh um you know
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
dueling facts is going to help us
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
progress this afternoon so if you think
 
03:59:46.710 --> 03:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
you're bringing something new to the
 
03:59:48.990 --> 03:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
discussion uh please by all means raise
 
03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:51.479 align:start position:0%
your hand and if it's just the dueling
 
03:59:53.870 --> 03:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
facts I again I think we've all done our
 
03:59:57.149 --> 03:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
homework representative
 
03:59:59.990 --> 04:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:00:00.000 --> 04:00:00.870 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair and thank you
for

04:00:00.870 --> 04:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:00:04.750 --> 04:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:04.760 --> 04:00:08.309 align:start position:0%
 
tone

04:00:08.309 --> 04:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:10.590 --> 04:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
um the student
 
04:00:14.950 --> 04:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
outcomes that we don't track in EFA
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
students in New
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but have been tracked in a
 
04:00:22.030 --> 04:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
number of other states can
 
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
here that's unusual is that better
 
04:00:30.830 --> 04:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
sorry the student outcomes that we don't
 
04:00:34.070 --> 04:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
track EFA student outcomes in New
 
04:00:36.990 --> 04:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in other states with similar
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
programs the outcomes have been dismal
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
when they have been tracked they have
 
04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
not shown comparable results to public
 
04:00:46.750 --> 04:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
schools to the point that a number of
 
04:00:49.510 --> 04:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
states have stopped tracking outcomes
 
04:00:52.269 --> 04:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
because it looks so bad for those
 
04:00:54.469 --> 04:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
programs I don't know why we wouldn't
 
04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
want to know how our students are doing
 
04:01:00.149 --> 04:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
in whatever educational environment
 
04:01:03.790 --> 04:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
they're in So to that end at a minimum
 
04:01:05.710 --> 04:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
and I do not support the expansion of
 
04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
this program but as it exist or as it
 
04:01:09.040 --> 04:01:09.950 align:start position:0%
this program but as it exist or as it
gets

04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
gets
 
04:01:12.189 --> 04:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
expanded I believe this bill should be
 
04:01:14.670 --> 04:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
amended to require
 
04:01:16.469 --> 04:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
adequate measurement of
 
04:01:20.149 --> 04:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes to require an annual compliance
 
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
review of the accounts to ensure that
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
students being enrolled are the students
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
who are qualified for the program um we
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're not tracking it and we are now
 
04:01:33.710 --> 04:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
saying if this amendment goes
 
04:01:37.229 --> 04:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
forward that in year two and then
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
forward our taxpayer dollars that we
 
04:01:43.189 --> 04:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
can't find enough of for all the bills
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
we looked at today for public
 
04:01:47.790 --> 04:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
education but we're now saying that it
 
04:01:51.030 --> 04:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
is okay to give these
 
04:01:53.950 --> 04:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
stipend to wealthy families whose
 
04:01:55.229 --> 04:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
children will go to those schools
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they got the
 
04:01:59.550 --> 04:01:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
not representative
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
D are children of wealthy families
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
entitled to go to public
 
04:02:11.229 --> 04:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
schools all children are welcomed and
 
04:02:14.710 --> 04:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
all public schools required to take all
 
04:02:16.910 --> 04:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
children thank
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
Brown well representative Damon perhaps
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're reading perhaps we're reading
 
04:02:32.389 --> 04:02:32.399 align:start position:0%
different reports on success of efas but
 
04:02:35.590 --> 04:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
first of all it is the state is paying
 
04:02:38.030 --> 04:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
for efas but to Simply claim it's a
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
welfare program is absurd um article not
 
04:02:44.990 --> 04:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
say that I know I'm just I I will get to
 
04:02:48.149 --> 04:02:48.159 align:start position:0%
my point me so I want to clar I am G I
 
04:02:51.269 --> 04:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
will respond to your brown has the floor
 
04:02:54.349 --> 04:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
in a moment um but the comment that this
 
04:02:56.950 --> 04:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
is just a subsidy and it's a welfare
 
04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
program is absurd I just want to make
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
that point
 
04:03:02.469 --> 04:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
General I know you didn't say that but
 
04:03:04.110 --> 04:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned that this is just State
 
04:03:06.670 --> 04:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
paying money and it's it's not really
 
04:03:10.670 --> 04:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
you know suiting helping students out
 
04:03:14.189 --> 04:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
um because article 83 says we'll cherish
 
04:03:16.349 --> 04:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
public education we will not cherish
 
04:03:19.030 --> 04:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
Public School monopolies and parents
 
04:03:20.990 --> 04:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
have found that public schools have been
 
04:03:25.309 --> 04:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
revealed to push Dei CRT curriculum and
 
04:03:28.030 --> 04:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
and sexually inappropriate material in
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
their schools and efas Ure that every
 
04:03:32.990 --> 04:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
child achieves maximum success and
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
parents have a say in their the schools
 
04:03:38.670 --> 04:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
their kids go to the progressive policy
 
04:03:40.870 --> 04:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
Institute reports minority families in
 
04:03:43.229 --> 04:03:43.239 align:start position:0%
particular are flocking to school choice
 
04:03:45.309 --> 04:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
programs around the country and
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
lowincome children have seen quote their
 
04:03:50.910 --> 04:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
test scores go up with greater gains for
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
English Learners and students with
 
04:03:55.030 --> 04:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities because it makes it easier
 
04:03:57.469 --> 04:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
for families to choose among a range of
 
04:03:59.830 --> 04:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
schools second of all the claim that
 
04:04:02.630 --> 04:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
efas are unaudited is also false there
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
are three criteria used to track EFA
 
04:04:08.030 --> 04:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
success in our State national tests
 
04:04:10.349 --> 04:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessments and
 
04:04:13.229 --> 04:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
portfolios I've heard a number of people
 
04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
I've received received emails from
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
people saying it's un audited that's
 
04:04:19.870 --> 04:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
false in fact the Nea itself has been
 
04:04:23.309 --> 04:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
very harsh on drill and kill testing
 
04:04:25.349 --> 04:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
even labeling standardized testing
 
04:04:28.110 --> 04:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and racist and preferring
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
to go with portfolios and Capstone
 
04:04:33.229 --> 04:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
projects so I can't tell you how pleased
 
04:04:37.229 --> 04:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:40.670 --> 04:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:42.910 --> 04:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
comments I have one more comment
 
04:04:45.550 --> 04:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
representative rcky you you have one no
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative lad yeah
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
um the issue I I'm real concern that the
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
what bothers me is that when we have the
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
statement that this program is going to
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
cost $100 million I think that's totally
 
04:05:00.910 --> 04:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh off off
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
track if in fact we had Universal for FY
 
04:05:09.790 --> 04:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
26 and Universal for FY 27 the combined
 
04:05:15.469 --> 04:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
costs would be a little over $17 million
 
04:05:15.479 --> 04:05:17.389 align:start position:0%
costs would be a little over $17 million
17.5

04:05:17.389 --> 04:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
17.5
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
million um and and and when I hear this
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
our taxpayer dollars whose taxpayer
 
04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
dollars are these the taxpayers dollars
 
04:05:31.830 --> 04:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
they are my dollars your dollars
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's dollars come together to do
 
04:05:36.590 --> 04:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
this and I feel that everybody who's
 
04:05:40.149 --> 04:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
paying into our tax system should have
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to gain from that
 
04:05:44.670 --> 04:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
contribution regardless of whether they
 
04:05:47.830 --> 04:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
opt for a private school or some other
 
04:05:49.070 --> 04:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
form of
 
04:05:52.510 --> 04:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
Education uh so it it's I I have always
 
04:05:54.990 --> 04:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
been a very strong advocate for public
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
education and will continue to be that
 
04:06:00.030 --> 04:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm also an advocate for those
 
04:06:02.550 --> 04:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
students which have not been served well
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
by that particular system and that are
 
04:06:07.750 --> 04:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
served better in other
 
04:06:11.229 --> 04:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities so and and lastly for
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
those those students now that are going
 
04:06:16.269 --> 04:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
to be entering as you know up to
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
400% we we have many of those students
 
04:06:21.870 --> 04:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
right now 350 are lower but so now we're
 
04:06:23.269 --> 04:06:23.279 align:start position:0%
going to be getting more students which
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
are not participating or receiving
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
benefit from the f&amp;r
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
program and when you do that then the
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
amount of differentiated Aid they
 
04:06:33.429 --> 04:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
receive is less so their average cost is
 
04:06:35.429 --> 04:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
not going to be $5,200 it's going to be
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
close to
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
$4,400 so there there there are a lot of
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
issues here and and as represent
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
spillsbury has said
 
04:06:45.870 --> 04:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
we can get down into the weeds and start
 
04:06:47.229 --> 04:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
talking about all these dollars and
 
04:06:49.710 --> 04:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
gains and this and that I I think the
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
the wisest thing for us to keep in mind
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
is it what is the best fit for every
 
04:06:58.990 --> 04:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
child thank you very much so um I don't
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
want to close off uh debate um but I
 
04:07:04.149 --> 04:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
would just simply ask that any further
 
04:07:07.630 --> 04:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
discussion focuses on the specific
 
04:07:09.670 --> 04:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill and of the amendment
 
04:07:12.389 --> 04:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
which has to do with the threshold if
 
04:07:15.670 --> 04:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
any for means to testing and there will
 
04:07:17.590 --> 04:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
be a lot of fruitful discussion I think
 
04:07:20.030 --> 04:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
in the fall on retained bills uh and
 
04:07:21.229 --> 04:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
going into the second year of the
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
session on the ongoing questions of
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
accountability and Audits and Reporting
 
04:07:30.149 --> 04:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
and so on and I for one fully intend to
 
04:07:33.109 --> 04:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
engage in those discussions seriously so
 
04:07:35.229 --> 04:07:35.239 align:start position:0%
are there further comments on the
 
04:07:37.349 --> 04:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
question of the bill and the amendment
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
which is the the means testing percent
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative luno thanks thanks
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and I appreciate your
 
04:07:47.309 --> 04:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
comments with regards to the second year
 
04:07:50.109 --> 04:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
of this session because um we we you
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
know are expecting a um performance
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
audit from the state Auditors part of
 
04:07:59.389 --> 04:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
the legislative uh Bud budget office and
 
04:08:01.510 --> 04:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I think they'll probably
 
04:08:03.309 --> 04:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
have a number of recommendations that
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
that go along the lines of what you
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
talked about Mr chair but uh but I want
 
04:08:10.590 --> 04:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
to talk I um I I want to talk about the
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
um the $17 million
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
the um estimate cost estimate that
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative lad talked about and the
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
$102 million um that um that that I
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
think I've been very transparent on how
 
04:08:27.070 --> 04:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
I calculated that and while I agree that
 
04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
maybe not um clearly it's an exposure
 
04:08:35.950 --> 04:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
level I'm not saying that all 391 fy2
 
04:08:37.990 --> 04:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
home education students are going to
 
04:08:41.070 --> 04:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
Avail themselves of a of a voucher but
 
04:08:44.910 --> 04:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
that um but that uh adding together the
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
16614 New Hampshire kids that would qu
 
04:08:49.630 --> 04:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
be eligible for a voucher in a un in the
 
04:08:51.990 --> 04:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
Universal provision here that attend
 
04:08:55.309 --> 04:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
private schools plus the um 391 who
 
04:08:57.870 --> 04:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
attend home education programs uh would
 
04:08:59.830 --> 04:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
be eligible that you multiply that by
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
5200 and you get the 102 million but if
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
we just sort of you know said all right
 
04:09:08.830 --> 04:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
somehow this this Universal part is
 
04:09:10.990 --> 04:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
going to be between 17 and a half Mill
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
17 million what um what what um
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
represent Vlad said and 102 million that
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
that you could take a look at what that
 
04:09:20.710 --> 04:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
would mean for our public schools and
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
for our our our taxpayers and all we
 
04:09:26.269 --> 04:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
have to do is go back to the spreadsheet
 
04:09:29.389 --> 04:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
we got after lunch on House Bill 563 and
 
04:09:31.269 --> 04:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
I think at one point our our
 
04:09:34.109 --> 04:09:34.119 align:start position:0%
conversation looked to column n which is
 
04:09:36.750 --> 04:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity disparity Aid which
 
04:09:39.389 --> 04:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
is currently $13 million total Statewide
 
04:09:41.469 --> 04:09:41.479 align:start position:0%
even less than what representative lad
 
04:09:44.109 --> 04:09:44.119 align:start position:0%
is talking about in the low estimate
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
what I what I would say is the lowball
 
04:09:49.269 --> 04:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
estimate on um on the uh the the voucher
 
04:09:51.990 --> 04:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
expansion certainly um it's far less
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
than 102 million that I think is much
 
04:09:56.950 --> 04:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
more reasonably justif reasonably
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
calculated and uh and fully transparent
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
on how how how I calculate that that
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
number but if we um if we went with the
 
04:10:07.710 --> 04:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
uh with the 102 million seriously you
 
04:10:11.149 --> 04:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
could take all of the the towns all of
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers that are in these
 
04:10:16.990 --> 04:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
in these 40 towns that qualify for
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal um capacity to disparity Aid and
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
add another zero on to the end of that
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
number so so the folks in in Keen um
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
rather than Keen receiving three um
 
04:10:32.429 --> 04:10:32.439 align:start position:0%
324,000 it would be 3.2 million would be
 
04:10:34.750 --> 04:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
their their cont increased contribution
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
from the state and reduction in local
 
04:10:39.070 --> 04:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
property taxes um that support their
 
04:10:40.990 --> 04:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
school and you could go down each one of
 
04:10:43.830 --> 04:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
these um each one of these places
 
04:10:46.510 --> 04:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and see a significant increase
 
04:10:50.349 --> 04:10:50.359 align:start position:0%
and and it would going back to um to to
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
all of the things we talked about the
 
04:10:55.389 --> 04:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
burden on our local taxpayer well here's
 
04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
$102 million that I think we could we
 
04:11:00.750 --> 04:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
could use to provide some some property
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
tax relief and and ease the burden on
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
our on our property taxpayers and uh
 
04:11:08.469 --> 04:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
this program I I don't think is the is
 
04:11:10.750 --> 04:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
certainly not the uh the solution to
 
04:11:14.189 --> 04:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
that um to that thank you I I think if
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
there was a consensus that there was a
 
04:11:18.790 --> 04:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
$100 million exposure then the views of
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
the committee might be different but
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
there is no consensus any further
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
comments yeses thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
if I could just
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
address the the issue seems to be that
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about a voucher system
 
04:11:37.109 --> 04:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
we're actually talking about parental
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
choice and the options that are given so
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
I want to just testify to my own
 
04:11:45.109 --> 04:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
personal experience when they cut music
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
from my district because of the budget
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
constraints in
 
04:11:52.830 --> 04:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
1993 we had no choice with our children
 
04:11:55.189 --> 04:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
we had a single school that was offered
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
nothing else to do and my children who
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
needed music were a family of musicians
 
04:12:02.070 --> 04:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
were not given the option so we pulled
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
them out and we
 
04:12:06.990 --> 04:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooled if I had had this account I
 
04:12:09.389 --> 04:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
would have still have my wife the
 
04:12:12.429 --> 04:12:12.439 align:start position:0%
accountant and she would have used this
 
04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
to send my children to Opportunities and
 
04:12:16.389 --> 04:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
to places that they could not otherwise
 
04:12:18.189 --> 04:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
go we could have taken advantage of
 
04:12:19.710 --> 04:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
conquered School of Music and things
 
04:12:21.389 --> 04:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
like that without even spending what was
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
being offered to us because we had a
 
04:12:26.710 --> 04:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
very frugal we were a single salary a
 
04:12:28.990 --> 04:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
teacher who was inadequately paid as all
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
teachers are and my wife who had no
 
04:12:34.670 --> 04:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
salaries she was The Homeschool mother
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
so our choice was to do the best we
 
04:12:38.269 --> 04:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
could with what we could and this would
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
have increased our ability to do the
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
best for our kids and when we were done
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
my children came and joined me because
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
my colleagues are the best people I've
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
ever worked with and my children all
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
went through penber Academy and every
 
04:12:54.149 --> 04:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
one of them was in honors classes
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
throughout AP classes throughout and my
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
son was the drummer for The High School
 
04:13:01.070 --> 04:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
band when he was in fifth grade thank
 
04:13:02.070 --> 04:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:13:05.429 --> 04:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
chair representative papichi Miller
 
04:13:07.870 --> 04:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will be brief two
 
04:13:09.429 --> 04:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
things that I want to make sure are on
 
04:13:12.670 --> 04:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
the record we did increase education
 
04:13:16.269 --> 04:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
spending last term by $193 million on a
 
04:13:19.030 --> 04:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
declining overall enrollment so it's not
 
04:13:21.189 --> 04:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
like we are not funding public education
 
04:13:22.830 --> 04:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
if anything it was the biggest increase
 
04:13:25.269 --> 04:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
that I can think of and second I
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question of uh what could
 
04:13:30.070 --> 04:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
we how could we possibly reduce taxes
 
04:13:32.710 --> 04:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
with another $102 million I I believe
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
the number was I'd like to just State on
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
the record that a couple of terms ago we
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
did exactly that we reduced swept by
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
$100 million and the impact on property
 
04:13:46.030 --> 04:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
taxes had has been invisible so we
 
04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
already know
 
04:13:51.070 --> 04:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
that taking a hundred million dollar
 
04:13:53.910 --> 04:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
less from the towns does not lead to a
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
decrease in property taxes because those
 
04:13:59.070 --> 04:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
School budgets just inflated immediately
 
04:14:02.510 --> 04:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
to accommodate for all that and more so
 
04:14:05.149 --> 04:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
you know facts should be on the record
 
04:14:05.159 --> 04:14:06.189 align:start position:0%
you know facts should be on the record
thank

04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
you okay any new
 
04:14:12.670 --> 04:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
ground on just to respond to the swept
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead question thank you very much Mr
 
04:14:18.149 --> 04:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
chair so so very interesting the um the
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
the $100 million cut to swept was done
 
04:14:23.670 --> 04:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
on a uniform basis to reduce the um the
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
swept rate that that that would the
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
equalized rate for all um uh for all
 
04:14:32.510 --> 04:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
properties uh in New Hampshire except um
 
04:14:35.149 --> 04:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
except utilities right yeah yeah all
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
property except all except utilities and
 
04:14:41.590 --> 04:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
railroads and so so where it very
 
04:14:43.070 --> 04:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
interesting because in contrast to
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid which
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
04:14:50.070 --> 04:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
communities which addresses communities
 
04:14:52.469 --> 04:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
with the least resources where the
 
04:14:54.870 --> 04:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
biggest tax cuts were because of the100
 
04:14:57.429 --> 04:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
million swept were in places that are
 
04:15:00.109 --> 04:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
tremendously resourced because the swept
 
04:15:02.630 --> 04:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
is such a significant portion of their
 
04:15:06.030 --> 04:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
property tax so thinking about uh cities
 
04:15:08.550 --> 04:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
and towns that are fortunate to have a
 
04:15:10.990 --> 04:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
lake or an ocean in their communities
 
04:15:13.590 --> 04:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
they saw tremendous tax reduction
 
04:15:15.630 --> 04:15:15.640 align:start position:0%
when the uh when the swept was cut but
 
04:15:17.910 --> 04:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
for places that had very high property
 
04:15:20.229 --> 04:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
taxes like Newport which I think all in
 
04:15:23.070 --> 04:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
was playing at the time close to $50 per
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
thousand a um U and I don't remember
 
04:15:30.189 --> 04:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
what the number was a 75 cent reduction
 
04:15:32.349 --> 04:15:32.359 align:start position:0%
in their in their state property tax
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
didn't do much for them but it did a
 
04:15:36.710 --> 04:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount for places with uh
 
04:15:39.229 --> 04:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
with low uh lower property taxes so
 
04:15:41.630 --> 04:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
there's no way you can compare that hund
 
04:15:44.790 --> 04:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
million swept cut
 
04:15:44.800 --> 04:15:46.710 align:start position:0%
million swept cut
from

04:15:46.710 --> 04:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:15:50.590 --> 04:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
2021 2020 2021 something like that to
 
04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about with ph I
 
04:15:57.710 --> 04:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
believe okay thank you um so fair enough
 
04:15:59.109 --> 04:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
but off
 
04:16:03.189 --> 04:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.790 --> 04:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah
 
04:16:09.149 --> 04:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh there clearly division on this issue
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
and uh different perspectives on the the
 
04:16:18.429 --> 04:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
value or value of uh of the uh EFA
 
04:16:20.750 --> 04:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
program or the voucher program depending
 
04:16:25.109 --> 04:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
on your choice of wording um and the
 
04:16:30.830 --> 04:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
division is uh is uh hard to
 
04:16:33.149 --> 04:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
negotiate and there's a great deal of
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
unknown about uh the consequences of uh
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
lifting the current cap from 3 50% a lot
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
of our discussion has focused on
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
speculation around how that would play
 
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
out so I I'm sitting here scratching my
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
head wondering why the proponents of
 
04:16:58.990 --> 04:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
this bill are asking us to jump all the
 
04:17:02.429 --> 04:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
away to throw away the cap not in the
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
first year that's I guess a compromise
 
04:17:09.670 --> 04:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
going to 400 but then it's gone which
 
04:17:11.830 --> 04:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
means that the millionaire or the
 
04:17:15.149 --> 04:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
billionaire or the uh High salaried
 
04:17:18.229 --> 04:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
executive who's on his way up or her way
 
04:17:18.239 --> 04:17:19.910 align:start position:0%
executive who's on his way up or her way
up

04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
um will be able to Bill a part of what
 
04:17:27.870 --> 04:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
they're paying already for the private
 
04:17:31.790 --> 04:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
school education of their children um
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
will be able to build the state for that
 
04:17:37.630 --> 04:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
part um
 
04:17:41.030 --> 04:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
it it seems uh
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
imprudent fiscally irres responsible to
 
04:17:49.229 --> 04:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
jump like that into a cost
 
04:17:51.670 --> 04:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
escalation that uh will be out of
 
04:17:54.229 --> 04:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
control it will either go way up as some
 
04:17:56.990 --> 04:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
of us think it will I share the views
 
04:17:58.830 --> 04:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
that have been expressed on that side of
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
it um or maybe not uh but why not start
 
04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
at a lower level I'm not asking for that
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it's a the whole
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
thing is a good idea but that's that's
 
04:18:14.950 --> 04:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh the way I see this leap that you're
 
04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:24.910 --> 04:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
unknown um I'd like to offer a a counter
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
perspective and uh it's not one that I
 
04:18:29.349 --> 04:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
think is intended to
 
04:18:32.950 --> 04:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
persuade uh you or to change your view
 
04:18:36.349 --> 04:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
but the counterargument is that those
 
04:18:39.550 --> 04:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
who uh have been the primary proponents
 
04:18:39.560 --> 04:18:40.309 align:start position:0%
who uh have been the primary proponents
of

04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:18:44.109 --> 04:18:44.119 align:start position:0%
efas have reasons many of which are not
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
quantifiable and never intended for this
 
04:18:51.109 --> 04:18:51.119 align:start position:0%
particular um uh program to be means
 
04:18:53.590 --> 04:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
tested and it was means tested when it
 
04:18:56.429 --> 04:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
was enacted in 2021 as a compromise at
 
04:18:59.590 --> 04:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
the time to get enactment and uh the
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
goal is to not have it means tested just
 
04:19:05.309 --> 04:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
as we do not means test admission to the
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
public schools so if the state is making
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
a commitment whatever that figure is
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
let's say it's an average of 5200 per
 
04:19:11.880 --> 04:19:14.070 align:start position:0%
let's say it's an average of 5200 per
student

04:19:14.070 --> 04:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:19:18.109 --> 04:19:18.119 align:start position:0%
the the opposite Viewpoint uh again I
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
don't expect it to persuade but the
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
opposite Viewpoint is simply that that
 
04:19:26.229 --> 04:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
fund that amount is following the child
 
04:19:28.349 --> 04:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
and I think so we've come to a point
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
where we probably have expressed
 
04:19:32.269 --> 04:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
everything that needs to be expressed
 
04:19:34.229 --> 04:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
and there may be in fact two different
 
04:19:34.239 --> 04:19:36.149 align:start position:0%
and there may be in fact two different
philosophical

04:19:36.149 --> 04:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
philosophical
 
04:19:39.349 --> 04:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
viewpoints so does anybody else want to
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
weigh in before we have a vote Yes
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Burton thank you very much Mr
 
04:19:47.149 --> 04:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm just curious given what you
 
04:19:47.159 --> 04:19:47.870 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm just curious given what you
just

04:19:47.870 --> 04:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:19:50.990 --> 04:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
said uh being the former financial aid
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
officer at the
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
University um for public education and
 
04:19:56.000 --> 04:19:56.910 align:start position:0%
University um for public education and
private

04:19:56.910 --> 04:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:20:01.030 --> 04:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
education we means test people to get
 
04:20:01.040 --> 04:20:02.229 align:start position:0%
education we means test people to get
financial

04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
financial
 
04:20:06.750 --> 04:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
aid and so and I I did two or 3,000
 
04:20:10.109 --> 04:20:10.119 align:start position:0%
applications when I was in that business
 
04:20:11.950 --> 04:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
some people came in with high incomes
 
04:20:14.910 --> 04:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't get the aid because we
 
04:20:16.670 --> 04:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to save the aid for the students
 
04:20:17.910 --> 04:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
who needed
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
it why why wouldn't we means tests if
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's I'm not a big fan of this all of
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
my constituents hate it okay so let me
 
04:20:30.309 --> 04:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
start from there but I respect
 
04:20:32.189 --> 04:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
everyone's opinion but why don't we mean
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
test the families who are applying for
 
04:20:37.510 --> 04:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
efas I said like one of my kids to
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
private school I admit it because he
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak Russian I never thought
 
04:20:45.790 --> 04:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
to ask the state to pay for that that
 
04:20:48.070 --> 04:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
was my wife's decision my decision and
 
04:20:52.429 --> 04:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
my kids decision so that's the two why
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
don't we means test the parents who are
 
04:20:57.109 --> 04:20:57.119 align:start position:0%
sending their kids for
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
efas well I it's boot for thought but
 
04:21:01.790 --> 04:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
you are speaking about the university
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
level the higher
 
04:21:06.910 --> 04:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
education thank you representative Mahan
 
04:21:09.109 --> 04:21:09.119 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a stop thank you Mr
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I'd like to take a stop at
 
04:21:12.590 --> 04:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
answering your question if I could
 
04:21:13.830 --> 04:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
because there are a couple of
 
04:21:15.550 --> 04:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
indiscrepancies that we're not talking
 
04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
about like the elephant in the room if a
 
04:21:20.590 --> 04:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
child is mandated to go to a public
 
04:21:23.870 --> 04:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
school according to idea and he's sent
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
off to a school that cost
 
04:21:28.830 --> 04:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
$250,000 a year we don't need test that
 
04:21:31.510 --> 04:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
child the town pays for that child but
 
04:21:34.950 --> 04:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
if if we're looking at families and
 
04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
we're saying we need to need test them
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're not need testing them to put them
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
into the public school they need the
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
public school in this case we're
 
04:21:45.429 --> 04:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that sometimes the public
 
04:21:48.309 --> 04:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
school doesn't offer What that
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
particular child needs and therefore
 
04:21:53.070 --> 04:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
we're offering the parents a choice
 
04:21:55.790 --> 04:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's not the $250,000 private school
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
that is mandated by the state if it's
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
specially at IEP involved but we're
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
giving the family a choice that says do
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
something else and here's some of your
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money some of the money you
 
04:22:09.790 --> 04:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
paid into taxes that you can use for
 
04:22:13.469 --> 04:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
your own children thank you thank you Mr
 
04:22:17.070 --> 04:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
chair representative Damon thank you Mr
 
04:22:19.950 --> 04:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to
 
04:22:23.950 --> 04:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
acknowledge oh so weird I just want to
 
04:22:26.429 --> 04:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that in the online testimony
 
04:22:28.109 --> 04:22:28.119 align:start position:0%
on this bill there are
 
04:22:33.229 --> 04:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
3,44 people opposed and 791 people
 
04:22:35.229 --> 04:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
supporting thank you for that
 
04:22:38.550 --> 04:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
information okay representative
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
peoples I wasn't going to say anything I
 
04:22:41.790 --> 04:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
was going to hold back because there's a
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
lot of conversation going on but um it
 
04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
occurs to me that the one thing that we
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
keep talking about and we put them into
 
04:22:52.830 --> 04:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
like little cubicles or cylinders or
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
columns or whatever is public schools
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
charter schools and EFA students they
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
are all children in the state of New
 
04:23:02.109 --> 04:23:02.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they all should be treated
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
equally if I floated an email out there
 
04:23:08.109 --> 04:23:08.119 align:start position:0%
just for response over the weekend with
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
some of our my colleagues saying why
 
04:23:12.229 --> 04:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
don't we just throw the whole thing in
 
04:23:12.239 --> 04:23:12.990 align:start position:0%
don't we just throw the whole thing in
the

04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:16.590 --> 04:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
away and fund every child at
 
04:23:19.109 --> 04:23:19.119 align:start position:0%
$7,500 they all get $7,500 and they
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
could spend the money wherever they
 
04:23:22.710 --> 04:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
wanted for for their
 
04:23:24.590 --> 04:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
education we're trying to get our
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
students educated in the best way
 
04:23:29.469 --> 04:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
fashion that that's good for them uh
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
providing Choice like this seems to be a
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
no-brainer to me we we shouldn't be
 
04:23:36.309 --> 04:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
discriminating against the kids who want
 
04:23:38.950 --> 04:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
an EFA whether no matter what their
 
04:23:41.109 --> 04:23:41.119 align:start position:0%
financial situation is just like we
 
04:23:43.550 --> 04:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't on kids that want to go to public
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
schools I just think that we should
 
04:23:47.309 --> 04:23:47.319 align:start position:0%
treat all students fairly and not
 
04:23:51.269 --> 04:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
them can I just clarify one point yes
 
04:23:56.950 --> 04:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bon earlier I think our
 
04:24:00.189 --> 04:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
chair and I respect everyone's opinion
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned that students who weren't
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
functioning well in public
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
schools deserved a place to go when EFA
 
04:24:11.109 --> 04:24:11.119 align:start position:0%
was away yet I think I hear that 70% of
 
04:24:13.590 --> 04:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
the students who are got on efas were
 
04:24:15.429 --> 04:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
already in private schools they weren't
 
04:24:20.950 --> 04:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
in more than that so I'm not sure how
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
that unless all the students now going
 
04:24:27.550 --> 04:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
into efas are coming from PIV Public
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
Schools maybe they're coming from
 
04:24:31.710 --> 04:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
private schools that are out of state
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
maybe your parents are paying for it
 
04:24:37.870 --> 04:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
they're paying big money for it um I was
 
04:24:41.950 --> 04:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
just curious about where that came from
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
the other point I me I used to major in
 
04:24:46.710 --> 04:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
economics and I remember step functions
 
04:24:49.229 --> 04:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
you remember step functions from your
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
economics whereas if we take a so many
 
04:24:54.030 --> 04:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
children out of a classroom you still
 
04:24:56.670 --> 04:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
have to run the class so the cost per
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
credit Goes Up For Students every school
 
04:25:02.109 --> 04:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
when students are taken out of the
 
04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
school the cost per credit goes up
 
04:25:08.189 --> 04:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
unless you eliminate the course and that
 
04:25:09.830 --> 04:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
takes a course away from the other
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
students who are in in the public school
 
04:25:11.640 --> 04:25:13.070 align:start position:0%
students who are in in the public school
building

04:25:13.070 --> 04:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:25:17.269 --> 04:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you valid comment and uh what
 
04:25:19.070 --> 04:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that the cost of
 
04:25:21.550 --> 04:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
educating a student is not a purely
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
variable uh expense item uh it comes in
 
04:25:27.950 --> 04:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
plateaus with fixed costs and capital
 
04:25:31.030 --> 04:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
asset and teacher classroom size Etc so
 
04:25:32.750 --> 04:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
fair comment appreciate if you don't
 
04:25:36.429 --> 04:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:40.349 --> 04:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
sir okay um there are clearly divided
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
views I think the views have had an
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be
 
04:25:47.469 --> 04:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
aired and so if there are no further
 
04:25:48.670 --> 04:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
comments or
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
questions it's time to call the role on
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:56.800 --> 04:26:01.830 align:start position:0%

I I just am having a hard
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
time dealing with the fact
 
04:26:13.710 --> 04:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about not
 
04:26:13.720 --> 04:26:15.590 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about not
discriminating

04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
discriminating
 
04:26:18.389 --> 04:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
today yet last
 
04:26:21.870 --> 04:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
week when we were looking at feeding all
 
04:26:25.990 --> 04:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
children we talked about discrimin we we
 
04:26:27.870 --> 04:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
that whole thing about discrimination
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
never came up I am
 
04:26:35.590 --> 04:26:35.600 align:start position:0%

04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
some committees that have had that
 
04:32:04.389 --> 04:32:04.399 align:start position:0%

mean yeah I know it I know that the
 
04:32:10.790 --> 04:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
finance has already gone that route we
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
could do it on the
 
04:32:15.790 --> 04:32:15.800 align:start position:0%
11th but we're it's being frowned on
 
04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
doing that so because we have other
 
04:32:21.070 --> 04:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
people want to attend from other
 
04:32:23.429 --> 04:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
committees and from the house public
 
04:32:24.990 --> 04:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'll schedule finance division one on
 
04:32:28.830 --> 04:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
the 11th thank you no that's that's we
 
04:32:31.349 --> 04:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
know how Finance works so I mean I have
 
04:32:33.269 --> 04:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
town meeting on yeah we're not going to
 
04:32:35.870 --> 04:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
do it on the 11th so it's the 12th we
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
have it scheduled the other item I don't
 
04:32:39.790 --> 04:32:39.800 align:start position:0%
have my calendar in front of me we of
 
04:32:43.149 --> 04:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
course we always do it on the Friday
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
um following
 
04:32:49.109 --> 04:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
session let me
 
04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
look and I would prefer to hear what
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
representative Damon said let's do it on
 
04:32:53.279 --> 04:32:54.389 align:start position:0%
representative Damon said let's do it on
the

04:32:54.389 --> 04:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um if we did that we could try
 
04:33:01.149 --> 04:33:01.159 align:start position:0%
to coordinate with people in
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
I think we're wiser just staying with
 
04:33:31.709 --> 04:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
the 12 and call and yeah we we we're
 
04:33:33.070 --> 04:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
going to have it on the 12th and we'll
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
just call people down when we get to the
 
04:33:37.869 --> 04:33:37.879 align:start position:0%
point where we're voting or we could
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
even get where you're obligated to be in
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
another place too we could get subs if
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
you're on Dual committees and doing at
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
the same time so we'll work that
 
04:33:47.879 --> 04:33:52.349 align:start position:0%
the same time so we'll work that
out

04:33:52.349 --> 04:33:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:54.670 --> 04:33:54.680 align:start position:0%
so yeah we're setting it up we're not
 
04:33:59.910 --> 04:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah there there's a room
 
04:34:03.629 --> 04:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
available we would be going probably
 
04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
down the hallway here yeah there there's
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
a room available I already checked out
