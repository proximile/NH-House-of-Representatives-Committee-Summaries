I'm going to ask you if you're familiar
 
00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759 align:start position:0%
with the way the house amended it on the
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
floor the other day yeah all right thank
 
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
you sir thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee Senator David
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
Waters District 4 introducing Senate
 
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 239 and I do want to commend the
 
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
house Health Human Services committee
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
and particularly representative Nagel
 
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
who's a world you know leading National
 
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
expert on these matters for his four
 
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I think helped clarify
 
00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 align:start position:0%
greatly some definitions and uh and and
 
00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:28.730 align:start position:0%
greatly some definitions and uh and and
procedures

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
um so I'll very briefly say what the
 
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
bill covers as a member of the
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
governor's commission I saw in the first
 
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that we were
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
establishing harm reduction as one of
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
the Strategic areas of the governor's
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
commission so that's why the first
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
couple of pages of the bill are just
 
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
putting harm reduction in there because
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
if that's our strategic plan includes
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
that it ought to be in the statute as as
 
00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:54.670 align:start position:0%
that it ought to be in the statute as as
well

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
this first part relating to the
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
commission I think also crucially adds
 
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
the president of the New Hampshire
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police to the
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
commission so we'll have more law
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement advice on the work that we
 
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
are are doing
 
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 align:start position:0%
then if you will turn
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
onto page
 
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 align:start position:0%
3 of the bill is amended by the house
 
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
section 10 this deals with the
 
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 align:start position:0%
governor's doorways program I want to
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
commend governor sununu for establishing
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
a doorways program by executive order
 
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 align:start position:0%
there are 11 of them around the state
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
they are saving lives every day they are
 
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
the point of referral for all kinds of
 
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
treatment and services and it seemed to
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
me since they were established by
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
executive order because well not by
 
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
exactly because of grant funding that
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
given their success that we ought to
 
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
have the program and statute and HHS
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
agreed so this is the language they
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
provided it doesn't calm the doorways
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
but that's basically what it is and a
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
crucial amendment that Senator Bradley
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
put in the Senate was to clarify that
 
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
this is not calling for State
 
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the doorways program
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
that they will run on federal existing
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
Federal grant funding that was the
 
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
reason it had an afan over in the Senate
 
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
got that clarified and that's why the
 
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
fiscal report now is different about
 
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
about that the third part of the bill
 
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
has to do with our syringe service
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
programs and paraphernalia
 
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
and uh this is an issue that the house
 
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
has acted positively on and with a house
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
bill but this bill was somewhat uh
 
00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
different for a couple of um uh reasons
 
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:40.460 align:start position:0%
uh because of what we heard from
 
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester and other areas about wanting
 
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
some coordination and consultation with
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
the syringe exchange programs
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
um this is what the chiefs of police
 
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
wanted and throughout this section I
 
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
just want to note that crucially the
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police are okay with this
 
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
language which they have not been uh in
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
other treatments of this issue so what
 
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
this deals with some of the
 
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
preparaphernalia issues essentially by
 
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
focusing on the folks who are part of a
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
registered syringe service program that
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
they may have these certain items like
 
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips and uh
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
um you know water and wound treatment
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
and other things
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
for harm reduction without breaking the
 
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
law over
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
possession of paraphernalia so this bill
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
has that applied to the folks who are
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
part of a registered syringe service
 
00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
program and that's an important
 
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
distinction but one which um affords
 
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
Accords well with law uh enforcement the
 
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
next and there's several definitions
 
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
then about drug checking equipment on
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
page five and you know the house bills
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
similar definitions and so on but that's
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
important to have in there so that we
 
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.220 align:start position:0%
know what the eligible activities are
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
under harm reduction
 
00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
um then uh the next part of the bill is
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of page five and this has
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
to do with education
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
um representative Nagel being a
 
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
physician specialized in this area and
 
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
others thought that it was important to
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
add in the um re-licensing process that
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
you would have taken done your three
 
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
hours a lot of folks don't get this in
 
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060 align:start position:0%
medical school and harm reduction is a
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
growing field so it made a lot of sense
 
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
to say that folks would get a little bit
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
of online training in that then on page
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
six is primarily what representative
 
00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
Nagel added in the four Amendment
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
and as I said what is so helpful here is
 
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:37.220 align:start position:0%
it adds important definitions
 
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.769 align:start position:0%
it adds important definitions
transparency

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:38.779 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:09:38.779 --> 00:09:40.509 align:start position:0%
transparency
clarifications

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:40.519 align:start position:0%
clarifications
 
00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:45.019 align:start position:0%
as to how this approach will be now
 
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
utilized uh and um you'll see the kind
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
of list here's of definition of what
 
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
harm reduction actually entails this is
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
mostly from the samhsa federal website
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
of these definitions and it Accords
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much with the kind of definitions
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
of harm reduction that we have been
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
using in the governor's Governor's
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
commission and it also clarifies
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
um you know that these are the
 
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
approaches for which this funding could
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
be used
 
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
if if provided from Grants and other
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
things that commission funds and the
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
opioid task force as well so Mr chairman
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to raise through it but that's
 
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339 align:start position:0%
these are the main components of it and
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
you'll see the new physical note says
 
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
that because of the amendments to it
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
um new appropriation or expenditure in
 
00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you uh thank you Senator
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
are you willing to take questions you
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
bet yeah okay
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
um or I I have a few but are there any
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.509 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
okay

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to jump around just a
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
little bit through the legislation but I
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think I'm not going to miss my points
 
00:10:59.569 --> 00:10:59.579 align:start position:0%
um now just just to be clear and be
 
00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:02.540 align:start position:0%
clear for the the public on on page four
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
on lines 20 through 22 there's a very
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
specific strikeout here so that uh what
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
is apparently in current law is that the
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
use of state general funds shall be
 
00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:20.459 align:start position:0%
prohibited unless otherwise appropriated
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
by the general court or if deemed
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
necessary to control a disease outbreak
 
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:30.180 align:start position:0%
so so is so this change as I understand
 
00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:33.779 align:start position:0%
it would now authorize General funds to
 
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
be spent on needle exchange programs is
 
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
that is that thank you Mr chairman
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so just a little bit of background
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know I worked for many years with
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
Senator gray and representative Hannan
 
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
on originally setting up the syringe
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
service programs and uh in the process
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
of that it was important at that time to
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
have this Prohibition in there to get
 
00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
that that bill passed as this program
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
has matured
 
00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:02.339 align:start position:0%
um and proven its success one of the
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
issues has been well sustained
 
00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839 align:start position:0%
sustainability of funding that right now
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
it is primarily grant funding and also a
 
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
lot of contributions being made by the
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals to accept the syringes to put
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
through their disposal
 
00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:19.019 align:start position:0%
um stream which can be very expensive
 
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
um but there's always a worry that
 
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
especially as these expand that we may
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
need to come forward and ask for State
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
funds now there's no appropriation the
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
bill but it says that if if there is a
 
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:34.740 align:start position:0%
if there is a request would have to come
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and get separately
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
funded by the legislature but having
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
that out of here I think
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
um is an is an important recognition of
 
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
where the programs are now and the
 
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
possibilities that that funding might
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
now be sought so um it seemed to me that
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
that that that that prohibition there
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
was kind of out of date and um a
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
reflection of the you know earlier
 
00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
iteration of where we were in these and
 
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
now we're in a different place with them
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
so I hope that answers your question you
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
did you did I think I think the short
 
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:05.420 align:start position:0%
answer is yes this would change
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
and allow General funds to be spent on
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
needle exchange programs yes yes
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated if appropriate yes are
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
there I still have more questions is
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
there any other question uh I don't want
 
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
to dominate this uh representatively on
 
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:21.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
senator for taking the question
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
um this may just be because this is my
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
first time sitting in on finance but it
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
looks to me that the existing language
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
in that line says that the use so state
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
general funds shall be prohibited unless
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise appropriated by the general
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
court which appears to already have that
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility to me so I'm trying to
 
00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:41.459 align:start position:0%
understand that disconnect
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
could you help me understand that
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
Senator yeah thanks for your question
 
00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:47.030 align:start position:0%
Senator yeah thanks for your question
um

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
it seems to me you know yes you are
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
correct in a way but I think it creates
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
a I mean you are correct but it creates
 
00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
a higher hurdle here and I think also in
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
terms of the policy of the state to have
 
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
a blanket prohibition unless
 
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:02.449 align:start position:0%
a blanket prohibition unless
specifically

00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019 align:start position:0%
um put forward
 
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
um you know it does make it difficult in
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
terms of when we are going out to buy
 
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
for Grants uh and there may be a
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
possibility of matching funds from some
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
federal grants so I think that
 
00:14:17.569 --> 00:14:17.579 align:start position:0%
um this means as a kind of like a
 
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
flexibility to it um I think you know
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
technically you're correct but on the
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
other hand you know working with these
 
00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
programs and with the with the folks who
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
are out there trying to Cobble together
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
the funding having this heaviness out of
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
there and you know there there is we do
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
have some funding sources that are
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
coming in from the alcohol fund into the
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
harm reduction programs and is that an
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
appropriation of the state well some
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
would say it is
 
00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:45.779 align:start position:0%
um so there's that I think that this is
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
why it's a it's helpful to have the
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
sense the statute would not be silent on
 
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:50.810 align:start position:0%
sense the statute would not be silent on
this

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up I I just want to
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
point out the effect uh that you
 
00:14:57.769 --> 00:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
observed is that just simply being on
 
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
the finance committee raises your IQ 15
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
points so that that's why you saw that
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
this time but yeah go ahead if you have
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
a follow-up um thank you yes my question
 
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
would be if those funds for the alcohol
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
abuse are part of the general fund or if
 
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
that's a separately allocated fund
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't quite understand it
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
you spoke to the funds coming from The
 
00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission are those General
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
funds or is that already specifically
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
appropriated for the use of alcohol and
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
drug abuse prevention
 
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure how that I could
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
answer that works out maybe you could
 
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
the way we look at the budget once
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
General funds come into another agency
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
however they come into there they're
 
00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
called other funds and this is a
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund so it isn't like we could
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
use it anywhere else in general funds
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's a dedicated fund specifically the
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
way the law describes it come out of the
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol sales
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
so then it's a dedicated fund and it
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
goes into this prevention program so
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
they would list it as other rather than
 
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
General funds thanks okay
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
so to complete the thought it I I think
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
along with you that it probably takes on
 
00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
the nature of being more of a grant than
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
a an appropriation but but I'm not a
 
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.750 align:start position:0%
a an appropriation but but I'm not a
lawyer

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
um do you have a another follow-up
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay so so Senator Waters um I I had
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
somebody reach out to me and and say
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
that they were concerned that um this
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
would potentially fund safe injection
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
sites in New Hampshire
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
can you can you talk about safe and and
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
for definitions just to get it off the
 
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
sides a safe injection site as I
 
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
understand it is where you may register
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
as a as a an addicted person and in
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
order to help get you off much like we
 
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
do methadone but there there are safe
 
00:16:59.629 --> 00:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
places where you may continue to feed
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
your drug habit but in a more controlled
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
safe environment so so I don't think we
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
have those now the methadone clinics are
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
something different so so would this
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
would this open up the door to Safe
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
injection sites for the the drug that
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be illegal for
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
consumption absolutely not and I will
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
expand on that a little bit as you
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
recall from our work together on the
 
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
harm reduction study committee last
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
summer we put in our report explicitly
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
saying that we did not support safe
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
injection sites and if you look at the
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
definitions here around water certain
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
service program can do that in nowhere
 
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
is safe injection site allowed under
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
those programs so I think that the
 
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
answer is absolutely not in terms of
 
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
whether this would open the door to that
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
um whether if the state wants to go down
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
that road that's a whole nother issue
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and then
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
um on uh page five at the bottom where
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
on line 33 the phrase all licenses are
 
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
required to register is is that I I read
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
the word all as potentially being over
 
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
broad it's it's mandating uh three hours
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
of training for all licenses and I I uh
 
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:23.780 align:start position:0%
I wonder if that could be or should be
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
more tailored
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think it is
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
actually uh Mr chairman because
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
um it says all licenses and then well
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
what it what are those licenses those
 
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
that are required to to register with
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
the controlled drug prescription health
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
and safety program
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
now those folks you know if you have you
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
have your prescribing rights for
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
controlled drugs
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
that's what your license is and so the
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
license that allows that are the ones
 
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
who would have to complete this because
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
the folks who don't have that license
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't prescribing so this is you
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
know certain
 
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
um Physicians nurses
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants who have have that
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
that that prescribing right so that's
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
why I think it is limited thank you for
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
that and and do you do you know what the
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
rationale was for choosing three credit
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
hours as opposed to one or six or some
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
other number
 
00:19:21.409 --> 00:19:21.419 align:start position:0%
um from my understanding and you know I
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
could ask Dave uh representative Nagel
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
again but I've done some other work on
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
this and three hours seems to be the
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
kind of unit that is used often in these
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
kind of training programs
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
um for a lot of for a lot of things that
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the hours that that
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
people recognize is getting the training
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
that gives you what you need so that's
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
that's why all right thank you are there
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative co-falt
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question so uh
 
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
just returning to this question of safe
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
injection sites I think your your
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
initial question or the initial question
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
was would this legislation enable
 
00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
funding of that and your answer was
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
absolutely not and then towards the end
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
I I believe I heard you say well whether
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
the state wants to go down that
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
particular path that's a different
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
question so I'm I just want to get
 
00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.210 align:start position:0%
question so I'm I just want to get
clarity

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:15.059 align:start position:0%
does the legislation as it is as we have
 
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
it today
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
would it authorize the use of funds for
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
safe injection sites or not ABS
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely not and it would take the
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
reason I added at the end it would take
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
separate legislation and very complex
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
legislation if the state
 
00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:34.700 align:start position:0%
were to go want to go down that okay
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying as I said our
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
study committee last summer we said
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
no great okay thank you for clarifying
 
00:20:42.539 --> 00:20:43.190 align:start position:0%
no great okay thank you for clarifying
that

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
are are there other questions welcome
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%

do you want to hit your mic or
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chair for being late
 
00:20:57.409 --> 00:20:57.419 align:start position:0%
um they're they're repairing at least
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
half of Highway 89 so
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
I'll plan ahead thank you all right just
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
just so you know we skipped ahead to 239
 
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
to as a courtesy to the senator
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
um are there other questions
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator do you have any other
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
concluding remarks based on this
 
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
exchange uh just again to say I really
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
thanked the house for its good work to
 
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
improve the bill and uh representative
 
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
in particular and
 
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to save some lives
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you sir is there anyone
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
in the audience who had uh interest in
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.850 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.110 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
I I think we're going to continue the
 
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:49.940 align:start position:0%
discussion before we come back to
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
discussions on uh on what we might do
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
with these but so let's pick up Senate
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
is there anyone here to talk to us about
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative kofault would you would
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
you please sit at the table and
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
you've done this before all you got to
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
and and then of course take some really
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I think so you
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
you caught me a little bit off guard
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
um Senate Bill 172
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
um allows court appointed Guardians to
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
receive uh temporary assistance to needy
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
families benefits
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
um I think the um
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
yeah the the challenge here was if there
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
is a parent who is
 
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:09.299 align:start position:0%
um really unable to function in that
 
00:23:12.649 --> 00:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
capacity in a court-appointed guardian
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
um is is directing the the upbringing of
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
a child that uh that the state benefits
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
should be available to them in the same
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
way that uh that they would if if they
 
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
were applied for by a parent
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:30.299 align:start position:0%
um is there is there if if there are no
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
ques well there this is where we're
 
00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
going to have discussions you can take
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
your uh
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
but let's talk about this a little bit
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh representative Wallner I I sort of uh
 
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
reserved to you my perception that
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
amongst us you're probably as
 
00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable on TANF as any of us are
 
00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:51.419 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious what you're if you
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
have any particular thoughts on 172 that
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
you may care to share with us
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
no I think it's a really I think it's
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
really necessary especially when you see
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
the number of children
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
who are going in
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
to our foster care system and there
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
aren't always appropriate places for
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
them but there may be court appointed
 
00:24:14.159 --> 00:24:15.430 align:start position:0%
them but there may be court appointed
Guardians

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
Guardians
 
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:18.440 align:start position:0%
that are not directly related like
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
grandparent sister those types of
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
relationships but these are people who
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
have some connection to the child I
 
00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:30.539 align:start position:0%
think these are really important
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
placements and much
 
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.409 align:start position:0%
placements and much
um

00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:36.419 align:start position:0%
not always but in a lot of times these
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
are preferable to a foster family that
 
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
isn't does not have a close connection
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
to the to the child so I think these are
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
real this is a really important addition
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
and tana funds are allowed for this
 
00:24:52.669 --> 00:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you for that is there
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
any other discussion on SB 172 anyone in
 
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
the crowd care to testify on SB 172
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh not seeing any I'm go ahead uh
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh thank you Mr
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um just looking at the fiscal
 
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
note I see that most of this is going to
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
be covered by the federal government I'm
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
just curious if we know if the upgrade
 
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
to the Department's Heights eligibility
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
system at about a million dollars is
 
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
covered by federal funds or if that's
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
State funds
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
and sorry if I'm trying to take my no no
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
no no I I really appreciate you taking
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
this seriously I'm probably going to
 
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
kick this over to Mr Ripple or
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative Waller but but TANF is
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
all federal money uh it uh accumulates a
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
reserve uh currently the reserve is
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
fairly significant
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
um I think it's in the you know 30 40
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
some million dollars range we did a
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
couple of uh actions in this last budget
 
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:52.580 align:start position:0%
cycle to
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
obligate around I don't know this is all
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
memory about 14 million or so and some
 
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
some new programs using TANF so the
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
reserve is actually still quite
 
00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
significant and it is all federal money
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
did I say anything wrong there
 
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
representative walner sounded right to
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
me I think the reserve may be higher
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
than 40 million that might be up around
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
67 68 million I I I'm just going off a
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
memory I I would always guess low when
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
I'm spending other people's money but uh
 
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple do you want to add anything to
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
that yeah the only thing I would add is
 
00:26:30.289 --> 00:26:30.299 align:start position:0%
there is a there is a phrase in the
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that's incorrect as I read
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
this now it says the TANF program is
 
00:26:35.149 --> 00:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
fully federally funded there are General
 
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
funds used for TANF however I did
 
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
confirm with the Department that they
 
00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
expect this particular program to be
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
fully federally funded and I think that
 
00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
applies to the upgrade to the new
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
heights eligibility system as well and
 
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
um the current balance in the TANF
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
Reserve at least as of the end of
 
00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
December was about 67 million dollars
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you do you have a follow-up all
 
00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
right are there any other questions
 
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.250 align:start position:0%
right are there any other questions
about

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
um SB 172 if not I'm going to set it
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
aside for a moment and uh and move on to
 
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.690 align:start position:0%
aside for a moment and uh and move on to
SP

for the record Henry Littman State
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director Senator Bradley wasn't
 
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
able to be here today asked that I'd be
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
available to answer any questions that
 
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.460 align:start position:0%

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.169 align:start position:0%
that you might have
um

00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
as you said it's been discussed fairly
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
significantly but uh
 
00:28:54.649 --> 00:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
um if there's anything that any
 
00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.059 align:start position:0%
information that uh
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
you'd like to uh or any other thoughts
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
on it that I can help you work through
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I don't I don't want to put
 
00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:10.700 align:start position:0%
you on the spot it didn't sound like you
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
you've come to say anything specifically
 
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
to us and and to your point about
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley he did pay me the
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
courtesy of calling me in advance his
 
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
wife is uh he's taken her down to Boston
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
for some uh routine medical procedures
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
so uh he couldn't be with us today but
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
he did call and we did have a
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
conversation and and one of the things
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh he and I talked about
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
um is was the idea of the sunset
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
provision and and I told him I was
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
disappointed that we couldn't get a
 
00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
six-year sunset in
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and and he he shared he shared a
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
thought with me that made me think
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
differently you know you and I have
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
talked about why six years is a logical
 
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
rational number we've got a year to get
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
through the current budget then we've
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
got a five-year contract that wants to
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
be a five-year contract one plus five is
 
00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.529 align:start position:0%
be a five-year contract one plus five is
six

00:30:06.529 --> 00:30:06.539 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
he suggested that it would be smart to
 
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
be able to write that contract so that
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
it could also be extended for another
 
00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:18.419 align:start position:0%
year or two and I I'm not nuts about the
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
two but I I could see the argument for
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
seven so so what what are your thoughts
 
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
I mean from a from a contracts
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint I think um you know from
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
experience of our last procurement we
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
did end up needing to extend the
 
00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
contract to allow the executive Council
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
to ask more questions and do more public
 
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.549 align:start position:0%
to ask more questions and do more public
input

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
input
 
00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
input
um

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
I think the extension ended up being
 
00:30:45.889 --> 00:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
like three or four months
 
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:48.140 align:start position:0%
um over what was the original five-year
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
contract to allow the council to take
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
the public input they wanted to do and
 
00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
considering the proposals that came in
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
and and such so having that flexibility
 
00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299 align:start position:0%
if that if there is a an agreement among
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
the parties that to do something
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
different than what was passed then that
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me as well
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there other questions
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
representatively on thank you Mr
 
00:31:15.889 --> 00:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you let Mr lippman
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
for being here while I'm not an expert
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
on MCO contracts I did trade options for
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
a while which are basically Insurance
 
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.130 align:start position:0%
a while which are basically Insurance
products

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
um my curiosity would be that if we had
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
an option to extend that would only be
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
when it benefits the state so would that
 
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
actually increase the cost of the
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
contract if we have a free option to
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
extend this contract for additional
 
00:31:39.779 --> 00:31:40.909 align:start position:0%
extend this contract for additional
years

00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
I I would agree with you that the only
 
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
reason to extend it would be if it was
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
in benefit to because going out to bid
 
00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:51.299 align:start position:0%
is for State procurement is I think the
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
the strategy um to get better uh
 
00:31:57.049 --> 00:31:57.059 align:start position:0%
experience for the state so again I
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
think the instance where it got extended
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
here was because
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
the interest to have the time to to
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
Really study a contract it's you know
 
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
one of the largest if not the largest
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
but as a follow-up if we were to
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
specifically include a one to two year
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
free option for us to continue the
 
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
contract would that increase the the
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
cost that the mcos would need to provide
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
to us because we would only extend it
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
when it was in our interest as opposed
 
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
to when renegotiating would be
 
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
to when renegotiating would be
beneficial

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that would extend the
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
cost or increase the cost I think that
 
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.289 align:start position:0%
cost or increase the cost I think that
um

00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know the the big reason for having
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
an extended contract period or a
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
five-year period is it does take some
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
time to recover the Investments that are
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
required to sort of stand up the whole
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
program for for them to extend that it
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
was extended I think it would be
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
in our favor when we look to negotiate
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
we're looking at not just what they're
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
doing in New Hampshire but also in part
 
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
what they're doing nationally and or
 
00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.130 align:start position:0%
what they're doing nationally and or
regionally

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
regionally
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
um and you know the longer they can
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
spread the overhead the better we should
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
be able to do
 
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you sort of clarify I think I may
 
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
have heard you use the word a free
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
extension I I just to make sure it's
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
clear is is that if we exercise the
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
option to extend it for another one more
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
year we are also obligated to pay
 
00:33:28.009 --> 00:33:28.019 align:start position:0%
whatever the costs are at the contracted
 
00:33:30.009 --> 00:33:30.019 align:start position:0%
rate it's not like we get a free year
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
correct but I meant by a free option was
 
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
the option to extend it for that year
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
which has value when you have an option
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
to continue at a currently negotiated
 
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
contract as opposed to renegotiating the
 
00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
contract as opposed to renegotiating the
contract

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
um in the future yeah yes ma'am my okay
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
so thank you we're we're very close to
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
one another I I I I I would just uh say
 
00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:54.059 align:start position:0%
that in my experience with Contracting
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
if it's in the original RFP and the
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
statement of work that we have the right
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
to extend for another year then the
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
bidding process basically Works through
 
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
the valuation of that term
 
00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:12.419 align:start position:0%
so so I I I still think that we would
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
end up you know paying one way or the
 
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
other whether it was an indirect or
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
direct it would still be in there
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
in the valuation of the contract
 
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
is it possible um if we were to do that
 
00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
to have the to require a bid for just a
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
five years straight and then a five-year
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
with the option to extend because
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise that that cost of extension
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
would be baked into that price that they
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
it may be possible uh I I
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
I in a previous life I did work a lot
 
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
with Federal contracts and so since this
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
is a I assume this is uh driven by
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
federal Contracting rules to a very
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
large extent
 
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.710 align:start position:0%
large extent
um

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:01.089 --> 00:35:01.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
we the the the right to exercise the
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
extension gets put in as an additional
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
line item and the and as the vendors go
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
through and and put the pricing
 
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
proposals together they incorporate
 
00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
whatever implication there might be to
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
that I I it seems to me to be fairly
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
standard in Government Contracting to to
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
say the term of this contract is X with
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
the right to extend it for a year at the
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
at the government's pleasure or benefit
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
so so do you do you do you still want
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
somebody else to come in and testify and
 
00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
if so what specific question would you
 
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
like them to come in to talk about
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
um I guess specifically I'd like to know
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
if we could have them delineate that
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
price of that option to extend so we
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
understand what that cost of keep of
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
retaining that option is how many
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in order to have the
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
option to extend it at the end of The
 
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
Five-Year process so so I think I
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
understand you to be saying and I'm just
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
clarifying that that line item you would
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
want it to be priced and we wouldn't
 
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:10.740 align:start position:0%
know the price of that line item for
 
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
many months until they went through the
 
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
RFP process and the pricing proposals
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
came back so so I don't I don't so let's
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
say your answer your question is is a
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
viable good question I don't think it
 
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
would be practical for us to know the
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
answer for you know nine months or six
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
months until we started getting
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
proposals back do you do you see do you
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
have any comment on this Mr Lipman yeah
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
I think it will
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
it will take some time to see you know
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
what what how that's going to play out
 
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
in terms of how many you know if only
 
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
the incumbents bid versus if we have new
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
entrants that are interested in in the
 
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.050 align:start position:0%
entrants that are interested in in the
market

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.250 align:start position:0%
market
um

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
but I do think that's something at the
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
state's option which you know I think
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
the executive Council kind of has the
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
ability to if there's the if the term of
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
the reauthorization is there to be able
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:16.130 align:start position:0%
 
Weiler

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
Mr Lipman if if we go to a PR make this
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
program permanent
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
I think it's likely to encourage the
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
feds to pay less than 90 percent
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
and what happens should that occur
 
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
I think under the current chapter law
 
00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
that it goes below 90 percent the
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
program ends that's built into the
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
current statute regardless of what's put
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you yes so so uh representative
 
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
Weiler that that was a specific thing
 
00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
that uh Senator Bradley wanted me to
 
00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:55.820 align:start position:0%
understand that this chapter law
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
enforces the 90 but when I but there's
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
still there would still be a wind down
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be an automatic termination
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
it would still take time but the other
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
thing that things that could happen
 
00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:11.099 align:start position:0%
um that uh could also cause the
 
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
legislature some concern would be if
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
they were to change uh the eligibility
 
00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:18.720 align:start position:0%
level I think right now is set at like
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
135 percent of FPL if if the feds change
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
that policy what implications would it
 
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
have for us what if they started to
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
authorize uh the things under the guise
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
of medical care that we made have some
 
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
disagreements with you know so so I I
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
still think there's sort of uh a sound
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
argument for a sunset on the belief that
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
this could be a really great program six
 
00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
or seven years from now but we should
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
not assume
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
when we don't have to but that that's
 
00:38:55.569 --> 00:38:55.579 align:start position:0%
that's me talking that
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
are there are there any other uh
 
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Lipman because I want
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
to come to you representative kovald I
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
know that representative Hull has set up
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
a set of issues that he might want to
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
would it be better to go through the
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
that list with Mr lippman here or or or
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
is it something that's just more with
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
the legislators talking what what's your
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
perception I think we can cover it in
 
00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
the latter category okay all right so so
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Lipman and before we get
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
into the next phase of this is there
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the audience who have
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
come specifically to testify about HB
 
00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:42.550 align:start position:0%
come specifically to testify about HB
263

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
263
 
00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:47.099 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gonna thank you Mr Lipman uh Mr
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to recognize Mr Steve Anon did
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
I get it close that time and not Anon
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
on him I just got to get the infosis on
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
the right syllable
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah all right
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
um I go by a lot of things yeah uh
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you good morning Stephen
 
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
and president of the New Hampshire
 
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
Hospital Association appreciate the
 
00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh speak to all of you
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
um as you know we have said uh time and
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
again as we have all heard over the last
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
several months this is an incredibly
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
important program and a very big
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
priority for us to reauthorize the New
 
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Medicaid expansion program
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
it's in our view helping provide the
 
00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:28.619 align:start position:0%
Right Care at the right time in the
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
right place for many Granite seders who
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
were previously uninsured as a result of
 
00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:35.339 align:start position:0%
the Granite Advantage Healthcare program
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
we've seen a significant drop in the
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
amount of uncompensated care that
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals are providing to those without
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
insurance we went from 173 million in
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care attributed will those
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
without insurance in 2014 to 2021 to 69
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
million and that's a direct reflection
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
of the coverage gains but we're also
 
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:56.339 align:start position:0%
seeing a reduction in the number of
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
uninsured patients who are seeking care
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
in the emergency room room as inpatients
 
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
and as outpatients and that's a that's a
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
significant benefit because you know we
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
know that when a patient shows up in the
 
00:41:09.849 --> 00:41:09.859 align:start position:0%
emergency room in crisis
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
oftentimes many of those conditions can
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
be treated
 
00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
prior to that before it becomes a crisis
 
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
and can be managed much more effectively
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
on an outpatient basis in a clinic in a
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
primary care office or a specialty
 
00:41:26.089 --> 00:41:26.099 align:start position:0%
office and that certainly should be our
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
goal and you know now we have the
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
ability to get people connected to a
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
primary care a clinic or or office so
 
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
that they can manage those chronic
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
conditions we also know that it's
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
providing you know important coverage
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
for those suffering from mental illness
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
or misuse and those are incredibly
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
important benefits for patients so I'm
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
happy to talk further um but this is not
 
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
a hearing I'm not testifying but happy
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
to answer questions that you might have
 
00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:55.820 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr Annan
 
00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
when someone gets certified as a
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
hospital in New Hampshire
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
they're given lots of tax deductions
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
they don't pay property taxes they may
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
be the most expensive building in the
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
complex in the whole town they don't pay
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms taxes
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
they don't pay business profits taxes
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
that's because we know you give
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
charitable care
 
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
so to come and say oh we've given all
 
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
this charitable care to my mind it's
 
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
somewhat equal to the tax savings that
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
the state has given you so there's an
 
00:42:38.569 --> 00:42:38.579 align:start position:0%
expectation that that's the reason why
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
we give this but with these programs
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
lately you're giving less and less free
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
care because with Medicaid and all these
 
00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.650 align:start position:0%
care because with Medicaid and all these
extensions

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
you're giving you're getting him
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
somewhat reimbursed for things you
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
weren't reimbursed with before so
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
you know I don't I I wonder if we're
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
really getting our values worth by
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
giving you all these tax deductions
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chairman I would say
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
um hospitals are providing an incredible
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
value to their Community
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
um the tax-exempt uh Provisions
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
um are allowed for non-profit entities
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
like hospitals that provide a broad
 
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
Community uh benefit and some of that is
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
certainly uh folks who don't have
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
insurance so providing care to those
 
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
that don't have insurance it's also
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
providing services without reimbursement
 
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
in the Community Education screenings
 
00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
other kinds of things
 
00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.099 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know hospitals continue to
 
00:43:32.099 --> 00:43:33.490 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know hospitals continue to
provide

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:33.500 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of uncompensated
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
care but they're also doing a whole host
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
of things as we think about the hospital
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
outside of the Four Walls of the
 
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
hospital as they reach out into the
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
community to help their communities and
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
their patients live healthier lives as
 
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
we talk about health care we often think
 
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
about what happens inside the doctor's
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
office or what happens inside the
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
hospital but so much of what determines
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
one's health is actually outside of the
 
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
Health Care system so it's housing it's
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
food it's Transportation it's a whole
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
host of things that hospitals are
 
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
working very hard in their communities
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
with other partners to address so I I
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh you know certainly
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the tax exam Provisions
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
that allow hospitals to work in their
 
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:23.940 align:start position:0%
communities but absolutely believe it's
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
an incredible investment that the state
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
and the federal government are making
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate that and we believe
 
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a much more than a fair uh
 
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a much more than a fair uh
trade-off

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
follow up do you have one no uh
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Anand for being here my
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
question is actually on the calculation
 
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.140 align:start position:0%
of uncompensated care I was curious if
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
that's the build rate the Medicaid
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate or how that
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care is calculated so
 
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care is always build on
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
the charged rate
 
00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
um that um so that we're all talking the
 
00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
same language
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that answers your question
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
um it does and as a follow-up is it
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
possible to um I guess it'd probably be
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
proprietary to know the difference
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
between the charged rate for all of your
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
regular care and what you're actually
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
paid not just on Medicaid services but
 
00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
by by insurers unfortunately that's not
 
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
a number that I have access to those are
 
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
proprietary rates that are negotiated
 
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
between providers as and and carriers
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
obviously the Medicaid rate is known
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
um uh it's not negotiated nor is the
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
Medicare rate Medicare pays somewhere in
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood of about 80 cents on
 
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
the dollar and Medicaid substantially
 
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:46.970 align:start position:0%
the dollar and Medicaid substantially
less

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
um uh for for hospital care
 
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to find out what
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
that level of uncompensated care was
 
00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
using the Medicaid build rate as opposed
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
to that full charged rate
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
I'll have to go back and and see what we
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
can parse out thank you
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions uh representative
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
Stringham well I I just kind of make a
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
comment on that discussion hospitals are
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
required to submit uh Revenue Center
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
specific cost reports by hospital and
 
00:46:23.809 --> 00:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
you can calculate an overall ratio of
 
00:46:26.109 --> 00:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
cost to charges is public information
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
so based on standard build rates and um
 
00:46:30.599 --> 00:46:32.030 align:start position:0%
so based on standard build rates and um
uh

00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
you know be happy to look them up for
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
um any other questions for our guest uh
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
uh representative is are there is there
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
audience that came in today hoping to
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
speak to the committee
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh with that then representative
 
00:47:01.069 --> 00:47:01.079 align:start position:0%
co-fault would you
 
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
um what we're about to do here is a
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
representative hole and others have
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time taking a look at
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
this bill and at a courtesy and an
 
00:47:16.609 --> 00:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
interest in learning something uh he
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today so he's asked
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative co-fault to represent a
 
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
set of bullet items that have a
 
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:27.260 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the bill
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
my request is going to be that we focus
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
on the items that may have a more of a
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
financial than a policy of implication
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
but I I think I think we should hear
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
them so with that representative
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:47.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:51.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I so
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
representative Hull sent me a number of
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
of points and I think
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
um one or two of them probably I I will
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
omit because I think they really are
 
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
squarely in the in the realm of policy
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily with financial
 
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
implications but
 
00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:07.849 align:start position:0%
implications but
um

00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
I think a number of the issues that have
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
been a number of the concerns that have
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
been raised
 
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
um are you know they they range from the
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
the lack of a functional work
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
requirement as it is and then by
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
extension a desire to uh to add to
 
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
statute that DHHS will apply for a a
 
00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:29.630 align:start position:0%
statute that DHHS will apply for a a
waiver

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
um for the work requirement
 
00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
um there are other
 
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
um concerns that representative Hull
 
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
raised regarding the need for some kind
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
of a copay
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
and that that coverage should should
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
ramp and not sort of a step function to
 
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
to get off of of uh the coverage
 
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
um that there needs to be a cap on the
 
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
program length for someone who's on it
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
that this should be a step up or a hand
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
up not a handout that becomes uh
 
00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.130 align:start position:0%
up not a handout that becomes uh
permanent

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
to clarify that's just the individual
 
00:49:08.690 --> 00:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
client level not at the program level
 
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.309 align:start position:0%
client level not at the program level
correct

00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:49:10.319 --> 00:49:12.589 align:start position:0%
correct
um

00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be a severability
 
00:49:16.609 --> 00:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
clause uh that there are no Good
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
callback provisions and the federal
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
government requires that
 
00:49:21.359 --> 00:49:22.910 align:start position:0%
government requires that
um

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
there representative Hull also pointed
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
to the to issues about
 
00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:28.910 align:start position:0%
to the to issues about
um

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
no sterilization quote in quotes
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
sterilization procedures for those under
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
37 I think that may be more of a policy
 
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.309 align:start position:0%
37 I think that may be more of a policy
issue

00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
um some form of a drug testing I'm not
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
sure if I if I covered that one or not I
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
guess and then I will add my own uh my
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
own two cents that I think sort of
 
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.109 align:start position:0%
own two cents that I think sort of
um

00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
reflect some of these but it's sort of a
 
00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
bigger bigger concern about scope creep
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
and the need for a sunset Clause because
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
I can tell you in Health and Human
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
Services we routinely see bills come
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
through that that add one thing or
 
00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
another to
 
00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:14.099 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid benefits currently I think
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
we have a bill retained that would add a
 
00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:18.380 align:start position:0%
vision screening program for children
 
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
and without going into the the merits of
 
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
that program or lack thereof I'll simply
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
say it's one more thing that that
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
adds to the to the cost of what is
 
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
currently a very very expensive program
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
to begin with so
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
circling back to the need for a sunset
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
clause and
 
00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.030 align:start position:0%
clause and
um

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
really feeling that if we don't have
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
that kind of periodic review the size
 
00:50:49.809 --> 00:50:49.819 align:start position:0%
the scope the complexity of this program
 
00:50:52.849 --> 00:50:52.859 align:start position:0%
really merits that you know
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
close attention and periodic review and
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
reauthorization by the legislature so I
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
think that's that's probably the single
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
you know biggest uh biggest sticking
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
point here
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
so I want to go first on this on the
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
sterilization up the ban on
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
sterilization up to the age of 37. I
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that this is in the
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
proper box uh would would the the
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
definition of sterilization in uh
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
include uh gender reassignment surgeries
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
where a person lost their ability to
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
reproduce is that would that be in
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not clear on that I'll let
 
00:51:41.329 --> 00:51:41.339 align:start position:0%
representative Leon answer that
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you the clear thank you Mr
 
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
chairman the Clear and Present issue um
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
that was raised by that is that there
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
are women with uterine cancer cervical
 
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
cancer who are being denied coverage for
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
a hysterectomy because they have not
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
reached the age of 37 or had children so
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
rather than removing a cancerous body
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
part they're being told to hold on wait
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
till you're 37 and hopefully your
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
disease hasn't progressed and Nationwide
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
women have died from that waiting okay
 
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
so I I clearly misunderstood the bullet
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
point I thought it was a ban saying you
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
could not get a sterilization procedure
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
until the age of 37 what I hear you
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
saying is that we we want the the
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
medical policy to be
 
00:52:25.549 --> 00:52:25.559 align:start position:0%
that under the age of 37 this if a woman
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
needs a hysterectomy or whatever that
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's a viable procedure that should be
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
considered and and paid for if elected
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
yes the intention is so that when the
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
MCO contracts are negotiated they're
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited from rationing care for
 
00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:44.180 align:start position:0%
hysterectomies especially
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
we're particularly concerned around
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
those cancer needs but to make sure that
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
care isn't restricted for adult women
 
00:52:53.569 --> 00:52:53.579 align:start position:0%
simply because they haven't reached a
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
certain age or had a certain number of
 
00:52:55.079 --> 00:52:56.150 align:start position:0%
certain age or had a certain number of
children

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
it can be endometriosis it can be cancer
 
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
there can be things where that is the
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
clearing indicated need but currently
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
our State Medicaid Program has denied
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
women that care okay so and you have
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
like you know documented cases where
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
that care has been denied this is a real
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
thing and not as a story we've had
 
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
constituents reach out for that specific
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
on the granite Advantage program thank
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
you uh representative I'm questioning
 
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
how this it relates to the fiscal impact
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
I thought we weren't going to discuss
 
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.370 align:start position:0%
I thought we weren't going to discuss
policy

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
we that's a fair question uh I I would
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
say in this specific instance uh there's
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
a financial implication to authorizing
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
care but that's lower than a and a
 
00:53:49.609 --> 00:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
current cutoff date that if in theory if
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing procedures on a 36 year old
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
that you were going to postpone you're
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
spending that money now instead of in
 
00:53:59.089 --> 00:53:59.099 align:start position:0%
the future and then there's the ongoing
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
health care cost issue of in general the
 
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
earlier you intervene in a in a
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
patient's care the better the overall
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
outcome and the reduction of cost
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
usually goes along with that that that
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
that's sort of how I think it's covered
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
today in fiscal we're going to get into
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
that if we start discussing age for
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
mammograms age for colonoscopies age for
 
00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:26.339 align:start position:0%
a whole slew of things that does not
 
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
fall into the purview of this committee
 
00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:35.540 align:start position:0%
uh potentially but I don't see the real
 
00:54:38.569 --> 00:54:38.579 align:start position:0%
threat of that because we were at a
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
specific list of items that
 
00:54:43.250 --> 00:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative kovalt received from
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative hole as being sort of
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
more critical and that he's further
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
filtered it to those that he thinks has
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
a more direct Financial impact and and
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
so far what I've heard is that there
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
there can be a financial impact of each
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
of those bullet statements do you want
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
to just read the bullet statements again
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
can you just summarize the bullet
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
statements and and and if we could get a
 
00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:08.339 align:start position:0%
copy to uh representative Stringham I'd
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
like to make sure that the notes are up
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
to date sure happy to do that so
 
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
um there's no current
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
or functional work requirement or
 
00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:19.940 align:start position:0%
unemployment training requirement
 
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
coverage needs to be a ramp not a step
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
function to get off the program there
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be a cap on the program length
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
for somebody who's on it there needs to
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
be a severability clause there needs to
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
be a sunset Clause uh there are new no
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
good clawback provisions and those
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
representative Hull's understanding is
 
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
that the federal government requires
 
00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.569 align:start position:0%
that the federal government requires
that

00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:41.579 --> 00:55:42.530 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
I mentioned the the sterilization issue
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about some form of
 
00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.650 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about some form of
copay

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
copay
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
ought to be required some form of drug
 
00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:54.020 align:start position:0%
testing ought to be required and uh
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
there should be a provision that DHHS
 
00:55:59.450 --> 00:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
must apply for a waiver on the work
 
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.069 align:start position:0%
must apply for a waiver on the work
requirement

00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:02.270 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:03.710 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
[Music]

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
says I listened to the list
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
they sounded sort of familiar to me and
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think that many of these things came
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
forth last week as amendments
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
and the house voted to reject them
 
00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
so I don't see how bringing them up at
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
is really necessary and particularly
 
00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
that most of the things on the list were
 
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
not related to finances
 
00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:40.220 align:start position:0%
uh thank you any other comments
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
representative uh Leon
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
um that that may have been the case
 
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
however debate was limited and in the
 
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
Parliamentary inquiries on the drug
 
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
testing it was clear that the amendment
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
was not actually read through because
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
it's specifically Exempted people with
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder treatment and
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
those who have been prescribed the drugs
 
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
by their physician and so by the lack of
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
debate on the floor I think that these
 
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
do impact the fiscal impact fiscal and
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
they were not thoroughly considered by
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
the house as amendments because debate
 
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:17.339 align:start position:0%
representative norgren
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would just make a
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
comment that the list of things we're
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
talking about all the issues seem to be
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
90 percent women's issues
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
so I have a concern that we've really
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
gotten into the whole policy
 
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
discussion rather than financial
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
I I hear you I I don't I don't make the
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
distinction we're talking about money
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
and in general I'm very Pro making sure
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
women have
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
Superior health care so I don't I don't
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
I don't understand that concern but I do
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
hear you uh what what I'd like to do at
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
this point is recess
 
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.349 align:start position:0%
this point is recess
um

00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
I I think I think we could recess for
 
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
let's say 1105 and representative walner
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
I am trying to wrap this up so so let's
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
recess to uh 1105 and then come back and
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
and at that point I'd like to hear what
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
the committee wants to do with these
 
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
three bills
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.660 --> 01:07:25.069 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:07:25.069 --> 01:07:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.079 --> 01:08:51.769 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.779 --> 01:09:32.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:09:32.590 --> 01:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
all right it's uh it's 1108 I had asked
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
for us to go into recess to 1105 so
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
we're just coming back a little late
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative tolerski is there she
 
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
is I think we're now all present
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
um having heard and had an opportunity
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
to discuss these three bills
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
um I I would like us to determine what
 
01:09:59.810 --> 01:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
our recommendation is to the full
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
finance committee uh or is there a
 
01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:06.179 align:start position:0%
motion on SB 239
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair I'd like to make a motion
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 239
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
my motion is to retain
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's been uh motioned and seconded is
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
there discussion
 
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
represent Leon thank you Mr chairman
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
um and I I want to thank Senator waters
 
01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
for bringing something to my attention I
 
01:10:32.510 --> 01:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
had been very very convinced that we
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
needed to have house bill 287 on the
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
drug checking so that this program would
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
be enabled and I had missed the language
 
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any other law to the
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
contrary that is on page four line 26. I
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
appreciate that in terms of the drug
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
checking but I'm very curious what other
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
laws may not need to be followed in this
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that this requires a
 
01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:54.500 align:start position:0%
significant amount of follow-up
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
so in this in what you're imagining for
 
01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:58.970 align:start position:0%
so in this in what you're imagining for
follow-up

01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:11:02.450 --> 01:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
um do you do you if if Finance keeps it
 
01:11:05.689 --> 01:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
it still feels to me appropriate to do
 
01:11:08.410 --> 01:11:08.420 align:start position:0%
more of a joint effort between
 
01:11:12.169 --> 01:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
hhsea and division three what what are
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that I think that that
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense this is something
 
01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
where we could look at this and look
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
within the syringe service programs to
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
figure out what other laws they may need
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
to be shielded from and specifically
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
call out whether they're notwithstanding
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
any other laws regarding Controlled
 
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
Substances to the contrary or if there's
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
any others that are also necessary for
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
their implementation I don't know if
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
there's anything about capacity issues I
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's any building code
 
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
issues I don't know what else is
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
necessary and I think that before we
 
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
pass something with the language not
 
01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
with sending any other law to the
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
contrary that needs to be done and I
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
apologize for not catching this in HHS I
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
I truly believed that we needed House
 
01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
Bill 287 to change drug checking
 
01:11:58.910 --> 01:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
equipment in order to be able to to test
 
01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.890 align:start position:0%
equipment in order to be able to to test
drugs

01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
represent walner yes I just would like
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
to know if I could ask representative
 
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.709 align:start position:0%
to know if I could ask representative
Mooney

01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
Mooney
 
01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
if she had other pieces of information
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
she needed before she moved forward on
 
01:12:13.970 --> 01:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
this bill what would what would she be
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
looking for in a for retaining this bill
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question no no
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
further information needed just based on
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
discussions and information related to
 
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
harm reduction I think comments that
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
were made by representative Leon
 
01:12:37.130 --> 01:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
the best motion here would be to retain
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up no thank you
 
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.770 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up no thank you
representative

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:41.780 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so my concern
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
um has to do with the definition of harm
 
01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
reduction and
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
um the the implications in terms of sort
 
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
of overall scope and uh and cost
 
01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:58.310 align:start position:0%
of overall scope and uh and cost
the

01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh the the definition of harm reduction
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
we heard from a number of experts in HHS
 
01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
and and it was interesting that the the
 
01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction and whether
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
it overlaps with treatment or doesn't
 
01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:10.940 align:start position:0%
overlap with treatment and
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
whether specific things might be
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
included or not it was all over the map
 
01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
included or not it was all over the map
and

01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
um as the co-sponsor of the floor
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment with Dr Nagel
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
um you know we we have made an attempt
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
to further refine that definition so
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
that it was not
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
so broad that you could
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
potentially buy someone a house to
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
improve their social and mental
 
01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.430 align:start position:0%
improve their social and mental
well-being

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.689 align:start position:0%
well-being
um

01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
while I'm pleased that we made progress
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
on that I've subsequently been hearing I
 
01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
also have have had someone raise the the
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
concern about safe injection sites and
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
that being labeled specifically as harm
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
reduction in other states so my concern
 
01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
is that in order to
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
spend this money wisely
 
01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
we need to do some more work on defining
 
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
exactly what we mean by harm reduction
 
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
if I may I'll tell a little bit of a
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
personal story I used to work for
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
Phillips Medical Systems I would spend a
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
lot of time in the Netherlands I would
 
01:14:20.209 --> 01:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
spend weekends in Amsterdam and so I it
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
feels to me the harm reduction program
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
and concepts are almost 10 years behind
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
what was going on in the Netherlands
 
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:33.980 align:start position:0%
they they tried a bunch of
 
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.590 align:start position:0%
they they tried a bunch of
needle

01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
needle
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
needle replacement strategies and safe
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
injection sites and the like and they
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
struggled with it and their drug problem
 
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.209 align:start position:0%
struggled with it and their drug problem
actually

01:14:46.209 --> 01:14:46.219 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:50.420 align:start position:0%
exploded and they rescinded all of those
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
statutes and went back to more law
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism so so I I I I
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
think I can support retain because I I
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't know the extent to which we've
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
looked at this in terms of international
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
Lessons Learned for example the
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
Netherlands specifically would be
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
illustrative in my view
 
01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh are there do you representative
 
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
tolersky thank you I'm I will not
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
support the retained motion
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
um I feel that it was quite clear
 
01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:23.630 align:start position:0%
um I feel that it was quite clear
um

01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
from the senator that this bill would
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
not allow for um a safe syringe
 
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
um location whatever the terminology is
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
um and I feel that we need to move
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
um what the house passed in terms of the
 
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.930 align:start position:0%
um what the house passed in terms of the
definitions

01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
definitions
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
um you know this is a much needed step
 
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
forward to bring
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
um to assist in our Battle of
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
um drug abuse here in the state and I
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
think that this will save lives and I am
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
extremely disappointed that at this
 
01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.030 align:start position:0%
extremely disappointed that at this
point

01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
um there's you know lines that were
 
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
missed in in the first committee but
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
perhaps since it was amended in a
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee of conference we could come to
 
01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of agreement
 
01:16:14.209 --> 01:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
to be able to get to that final product
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
but at this point I won't be supporting
 
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.810 align:start position:0%
but at this point I won't be supporting
retained

01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:19.739 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other comments
 
01:16:19.739 --> 01:16:20.830 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other comments
questions

01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:16:23.630 --> 01:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
representative co-fault
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you just just to clarify my
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
previous comment I I am also Satisfied
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
by Senator Waters statement that you
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
know you know he has said that
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
harm reduction in this case does not
 
01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
include safe injection sites my bigger
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
concern at this point is are there other
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
things that we're not aware of that
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
might be objectionable that could be
 
01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:46.140 align:start position:0%
included in that definition so that's
 
01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
why I believe it needs it need that
 
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
definition needs further work and
 
01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.290 align:start position:0%
definition needs further work and
refinement

01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
refinement
 
01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
in in my my major Financial view on this
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
if I just had could pick one would be on
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
page four where we strike out lines 20
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
21 and 22. uh I I think the prohibition
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
of using state general funds uh to pay
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
for needle exchanges is still the right
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
financial and social policy so I would
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
like us to take a look at that we we
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
have a motion uh that's been heard and
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
seconded to retain are you ready for you
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
have a comment or are you ready for the
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
vote I have a question go ahead um what
 
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
what what is our time schedule meaning
 
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
when do we have when does this when does
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
it have to come out of second committee
 
01:17:42.649 --> 01:17:42.659 align:start position:0%
so uh that that's a good question but if
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
the whole committee takes adopts our
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation to retain the answer
 
01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
becomes different it becomes that we
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
should have our work done and our
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation done by January
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
and if it's not retained
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh then another motion would be
 
01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.169 align:start position:0%
uh then another motion would be
considered

01:18:00.169 --> 01:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:03.780 align:start position:0%
and and let's just hypothetically say
 
01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:05.390 align:start position:0%
and and let's just hypothetically say
that

01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.890 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
that the bill is not retained by full
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee when does it have to report to
 
01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
the house floor that that's a good
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
question my vice chair who is on top of
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
all of these things is sticking her
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
finger on June is that June 8.
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
June is the last day to act on Senate
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
bills so that means we have a little bit
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
of time to get it to finance but to
 
01:18:31.729 --> 01:18:31.739 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler would would have
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
to have this done by January 8th
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it have to come out of our
 
01:18:38.209 --> 01:18:38.219 align:start position:0%
committee June 8th pardon me Mr chairman
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it need to come out of our wait
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
wait wait wait wait too many
 
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
conversations did you let since I just
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
invoked your name as the chair do you
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
June 8th is a calendar it should be
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
ready for the calendar ah so two days
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
before that
 
01:18:59.450 --> 01:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
all right so representative I was just
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
going to say I misunderstood the dates I
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
believed that June 8th was the day for
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
it to come out of the house and so it
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
would need to be in the calendar the
 
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
week prior for our session so June 1st I
 
01:19:12.169 --> 01:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
believe would be the last day that our
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
committee could act to hit the calendar
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
that night
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
so so because I'm having trouble
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
processing verbal information right now
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
what's the bottom line when does the
 
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:27.300 align:start position:0%
finance committee have to make a vote I
 
01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
believe it's June 1st June 1st we have
 
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're ready to exec the bills that have
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
come before divisions all right thank
 
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:36.420 align:start position:0%

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:37.490 align:start position:0%

uh thank you Mr clerk
 
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
um moving on I would entertain a motion
 
01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:49.940 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
263. representative Mooney Mr chairman I
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion on Senate Bill 263
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
the motion is to retain
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
do I hear a second
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
it's been motioned and seconded Is there
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Mooney
 
01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would first like
 
01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:08.340 align:start position:0%
to just
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
bring up that we are not discussing
 
01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
renewal of Medicaid that is not in
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
question in fact there's no question at
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
all that Medicaid will be renewed
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
we have thousands in our state that rely
 
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
and depend on it
 
01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
the question at hand is the time frame
 
01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:34.100 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not it should be
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
renewed after a certain period of time
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
after an extension
 
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
or should it be approved right now
 
01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.669 align:start position:0%
or should it be approved right now
forever

01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
forever
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
to me a contract this big a program so
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
large no matter what the content should
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
be renewed after a period of time
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
the huge disagreement about that it
 
01:21:59.630 --> 01:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
seems many amendments many questions
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
so I would ask that this bill be
 
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
retained so that those things can be
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
squared away and I would also bring up
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we have in House Bill 2
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
an extension for two years a good
 
01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
starting point in terms of negotiations
 
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
with the Senate
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
so this is on the table already
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
but for this bill being as large as it
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
is going on Infinity and Beyond
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
First Time Finance has seen this being
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
extended so far
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
I think the right thing to do is to
 
01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
retain and I would ask my colleagues to
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
support that motion thank you Mr chair
 
01:22:43.570 --> 01:22:43.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham yeah I will
 
01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
vote against the motion to retain I
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
think you know all the issues uh that
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
were brought up uh could be handled
 
01:22:56.209 --> 01:22:56.219 align:start position:0%
um uh by separate bill and stepping away
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
from the sunset they're all definitely
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
settled policy uh at this point so you I
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
know you were mostly talking about in
 
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
Premiere perspective about uh whether uh
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
Medicaid would be a permanent extension
 
01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:15.770 align:start position:0%
Medicaid would be a permanent extension
uh

01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
you know one point concerns were
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
expressed to me about the federal
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
government changing
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh the financial numbers uh to pay less
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
than 90 percent we already know that's
 
01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
already built into the law so we have
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
that protection
 
01:23:33.729 --> 01:23:33.739 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll always have opportunity
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
to bring bring new new issues regarding
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program it's proven its
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
worth and it's passed unanimously in the
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
Senate uh and it it passed with an
 
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority in the house
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
already I don't see any reason to retain
 
01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:54.260 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Leon you
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
have another
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
um I think that the the policy of a
 
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
sunset is absolutely critical we've had
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
vigorous debate in this body about some
 
01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
programs increasing their participation
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
rate from 300 percent of the federal
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
poverty level to 350 percent without a
 
01:24:17.209 --> 01:24:17.219 align:start position:0%
sunset this body doesn't have any say in
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
what Washington DC sets as the coverage
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
limit and that has huge fiscal
 
01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:24.300 align:start position:0%
implications but beyond that I think
 
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
that there's a huge value to retaining
 
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
this bill right now Medicaid expansion
 
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
and the work requirements are in play in
 
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
Washington DC and their in their debt
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
ceiling debate if we have already gone
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
home for the summer and we haven't done
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
anything and there's more major changes
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
to the program we have no opportunity if
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
we have not retained this bill so by
 
01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
retaining this bill it would give this
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
committee an opportunity to address any
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
changing scenarios coming out of
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
Washington DC which I think is highly
 
01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:53.709 align:start position:0%
Washington DC which I think is highly
beneficial

01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:53.719 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
01:24:58.850 --> 01:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.860 --> 01:25:00.110 align:start position:0%
