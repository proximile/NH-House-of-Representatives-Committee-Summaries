00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
the context of this is just we got
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
everybody to report the beginning and
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
ending under the same Bal like the
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
actual beginning and ending in the same
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
manner and then we put the commitments
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
or the encumbrances sort of off to the
 
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
side as sort of just a barometer but
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's not in the math so are you do you
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
want to change the math
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
now not go into minut okay because we
 
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
didn't discuss it that way okay but one
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the things that should be understood
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
from this committee is that when if we
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
set a cap on the fund balance ah okay
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
okay that it should be that cap should
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
be calculated based on the amount in the
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
fund at the end of the
 
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated money you know so if there's a
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
if there a million two in a fund and
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're setting a cap at a million but
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
there's 200,000 that's obligated they're
 
00:12:49.189 --> 00:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
good they're good yes agreed
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
okay right that we're not going to say
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
they had a million to even though they
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
had the obligated stuff we're going to
 
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
cut them down to a million so that take
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
out the obligation right they're at
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
right the the challenge with the
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
obligations is it's all just a timing
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
Factor so that's why we sort of put it
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
off to the side because it's not
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
relevant to the balance it it's relevant
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
in that to the reader but it's a timing
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
so the way I'm going to do it is for for
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
the purpose of these minutes going to
 
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
cross off and the annual funding to
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
produce the next budget and change that
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
to and the balance be C at a million
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
dollar but for the for the final report
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
you could say the end the ending balance
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
is the name of the column that shows up
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
in the report that's the number you're
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
looking at that just that number so you
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
could use that terminology I don't want
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
okay no I'm with you you want to sort of
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
do the math
 
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:58.030 align:start position:0%
do the math
ahead

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:27.949 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm told we're being streamed so we
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
will use the microphone
 
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
so so again you know I want them to come
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
back to me if they want to do something
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
with that legislation that makes sense
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
because if they've got a half a million
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in there and the only problem
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
was that they couldn't buy a
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
$300,000 that's an internal problem
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's not a g you know our problem
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's the they
 
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.590 align:start position:0%
that's the they
problem

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
so all right other changes to the
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
minutes I want to go back to the
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
previous one and just instead of saying
 
00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:14.839 align:start position:0%
a workable quum
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
requirement because that's what oh back
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
to the Quorum thing on page two second
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
paragraph paragraph
 
00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:32.350 align:start position:0%
paragraph paragraph
after

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.110 align:start position:0%
after
failing

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
to why don't you say after failing to
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
quorum that's all you need to do and
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
then comment later the it was the Forum
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
was shut higher than
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
normal oh I see yeah well the reason was
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
because they have a 17 member commission
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
with a 15 member Quorum right so
 
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
with a 15 member Quorum right so
[Laughter]

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
and at their first attempt at a meeting
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
uh a person I will not name uh insisted
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
that they do it that way okay
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
um I mean do you want to say the law
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
requires a 15 no no why don't not just
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
say failing to make calls okay fine like
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
you were saying okay all
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
right any other
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
changes no all right the first paragraph
 
00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:34.750 align:start position:0%
changes no all right the first paragraph
Yes

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
um something
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
there second sentence accounts in a
 
00:18:43.149 --> 00:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
system not in funded by the general fund
 
00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
in uh which page we page one first
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
page second paragraph about State
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
committee requested that uh the
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
controller and I viewed the funds in the
 
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
list of RSA
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
612 that are prefer as trust but um
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
essentially that for financial report
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
and purposes they're not or or in
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
general they're not true trust so we
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
highlighted what we tried to highlight
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
are um some of I the ones that we we
 
00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
agreed uh control and I agreed that
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
they're not trust and also they're not
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
reported as such um so initially I had
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
some color for you but um my number in
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
didn't work so you have uh no color but
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
um I can start identifying the funds I
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
can go Page by Page identifying those
 
00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:15.230 align:start position:0%
can go Page by Page identifying those
funds

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
um if if you would like to proceed that
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
way uh the other piece I want to mention
 
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.549 align:start position:0%
way uh the other piece I want to mention
is

00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
um in addition to the the review that we
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
did of those those funds um controller
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
call also is proposing some um language
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
change to the reporting
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
requirements uh in and and and I believe
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
she's going to elaborate on that so
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
that's at the end of this this version
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
this draft but I can start reviewing uh
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
again the initial request by the
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
committee I'm guessing that all the
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
things that you're proposing changing
 
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
are are either crossed out or or
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
highlighted in bold
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
um that is correct or have a background
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
gray that is correct and and and we
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
didn't all all we did in this in this
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
um in this version for again the request
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
of the committee was highlight those
 
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
funds are called trust and in we didn't
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
change anything is they're just
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
highlighted for us to discuss for the
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
committee to to review and ask questions
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
so for example on page three correct you
 
00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:35.559 align:start position:0%
highlighted education trust fund so that
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
is actually in law right now and you're
 
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
not proposing to change it but you
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
highlighted it because it has the word
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
trust in it cor right correct based on
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
based on again the committee's request
 
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
to identify those in this list are not
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
true trust they're just by name trust
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
although the ucation trust fund has
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
other potential consequences if the name
 
00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
was changed perhaps I don't know but we
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to ident identify for you to
 
00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.710 align:start position:0%
just wanted to ident identify for you to
to

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
review okay represent voling yes use
 
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.310 align:start position:0%
review okay represent voling yes use
your

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
microphone on P
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
page oh these oh there's the page page
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
six is the first example I think of I
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
think it's the first example of maybe a
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
number of them uh 167 about 2third of
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
the way down um you've just
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
bolded permanent or endowment instead of
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
agency fund and since we don't have
 
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
colors I'm not sure we're going to if
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's anything new that we're going to
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
miss them so um again the only reason so
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
I have some I actually have five copies
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
in color I don't have six this is why we
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
didn't distribute them because I I
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
missed the number but I have some if you
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
want to go by color it's it's there you
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
could have both if you like
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
well am I correct in this particular
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
example the words permanent and
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
endowment are not currently in law and
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
by the time this Bill gets to the Senate
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to be changed
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
maybe so so back to my question so the
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
words permanent and endowment on line
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
167 on page six yeah and if you recall
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
are new yes so I maybe we need to recap
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
what we discussed last time so for
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
example what uh represent Al is
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
referring to um initially my what we
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
what we reviewed last time was the fact
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
that we were um just clarifying the
 
00:25:12.669 --> 00:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
language of RSA 612 c and d and one of
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
the comments that I made uh for example
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
to to remove the war agency the war
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
agency again a financial reporting
 
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
purposes that became a problematic and
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
confusing uh that's why the the the um
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
the pronouncement were changed to to
 
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
call it something different now it's
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
called custodial accounts so um the the
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
number 167 and 16 um think it's just 67
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's just it's just again just
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
following the same um format and
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
removing the word agency here and I
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
think the other piece that we discussed
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
last time is the fact that this RSA 612
 
00:25:54.919 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
last time is the fact that this RSA 612
also

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:55.730 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.110 align:start position:0%
also
[Music]

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
includes um
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
um those not what's listed under SI 612
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
C and D is also listed under RSA
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
612 and maybe if I recall correctly you
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
were um thinking about maybe moving the
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
these two numbers and others to the top
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
to try to clarify if I recall uh a brief
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
conversation about that
 
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
um okay uh but I did so I didn't change
 
00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.750 align:start position:0%
um okay uh but I did so I didn't change
that

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
and um again this this this this
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
particular version the only difference
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
is that we highlighted the the word
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
trust for your um for your consideration
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
as you were um you had questions about
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
some in
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
particular represent yeah now that we've
 
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:49.990 align:start position:0%
particular represent yeah now that we've
got

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
colors uh there there are ones that are
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
bolded on in green the trust you will
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
see in green that's correct yeah oh so
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's uh all places where the word
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
trust exists correct oh okay correct I'm
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
glad that's helpful whether or not it's
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate because it certainly is for
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
lchip which is so for example I wouldn't
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
include some of
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
them in the list of R 6612 C and D
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
because they're not first of all we
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
don't have them as separate off book
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
accounts they're just they live in the
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
accounting system system some of them
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
are Appropriations for example on page
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
five you will see um the El chip program
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
the lchip trust that's really an
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
appropriation by the state it lives in
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
the it lives in the operating budget um
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
but they've always had the name of lchip
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
trust um but it's not a true trust in a
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
way really
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
um it's certainly not maintained
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
separate but you're not trying to move
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
it to C C or D I'm not unless you have
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
um unless you're suggest that and and
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
um and and and probably the controller
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
could help me here because some of them
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
as they're just State business and and
 
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
they're just funds that handle the
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
activity of that particular
 
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
program so uh they're not real trust
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
they're not endowments this is why I
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
example would you like me to jump in
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
Dana call com troller for the record um
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
I think what we were we're trying to do
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of moving and shaking here
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
and and a followup to a conversation you
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
got you all had I wasn't here but I
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
think um one of the goals of
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
reorganizing this section is to make um
 
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
for the treasurer it clear in the C and
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
D sections what are two TR true trusts
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
permanent endowment and then indeed
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
custodial Arrangements that really
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
there's another control over those funds
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
there's an outside legal purpose
 
00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
document whatever it may be unlike all
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the items that are numbered 1 through
 
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
395 which are more uh dedicated for a
 
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
particular purpose and the purview of
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
this Committee in my view I I would
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
stand corrected if you've feel
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
differently but I I think what we're
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do is simplify the true trusts
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
permanent funds endowment funds that
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
have true legal structures around them
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
get reported currently in three
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
different Publications by the state um
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
the treasurer has to report them in her
 
00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
annual report I need to report them in
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
the state's audit and they go in the
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
dedicative funds report and and MO two
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
out of three of these are very manual
 
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
processes like I I think that one of the
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
goals is that I feel this report um in
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
my view is very valuable for dedicated
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
funds that are numbered 1 through 395
 
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
because there is no other report that in
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
the state that gives you the detail that
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
you're looking for whereas trust funds
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
endowment funds permanent funds the
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
treasurer is required to report those in
 
00:30:20.909 --> 00:30:20.919 align:start position:0%
her annual reports with the level of
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
detail that would be the bare minimum
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
that would be required so I think what
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is simplify which I
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
think is a goal of this committee still
 
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
provide for items that are numerically
 
00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
in the first portion of 612 still
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
provide a page in this report for you to
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
do your review but if it's reported
 
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in a different capacity and
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
there's a different set of rules and
 
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
structures we're trying to sort of carve
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
those out and for that reason I added a
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
proposal at the very end of the document
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
to remove those trust funds with that
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
are in C and D to to take them out of
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
the exempt them from the reporting
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
requirements similar to what we did two
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
years ago when we Exempted the entire
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
lior Commission because that's a
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
separate annual report already you know
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
for example or the education trust fund
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
the highway fund those funds are all
 
00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
separately reported under other
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
accounting or statutory requirements
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
whereas your regular dedicated funds 1
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
through 395 really don't have a separate
 
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement elsewhere so they
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
kind of go in the book so we're trying
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
to make those distinctions so we're not
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
duplicating efforts across Publications
 
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
but also provide you really the detail
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
that you want in doing your annual
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
reviews that's pres
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
wer could we just simply remove the word
 
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
trust from the areas that are
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
highlighted in
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
green some of those if yes I think if
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
you not the education trust fund I would
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
not suggest we we touch that one but for
 
00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
instance the opio de batement trust or
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
the drinking water groundwater trust if
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
they're not currently a true trust you
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
may want to make them that in the future
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
but if they're not currently they would
 
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
just be a fund and they would go in the
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund book at the level of
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
detail that you need to do your review
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
because right now for instance the
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater trust is in
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
my financial statements part of the
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
general fund it's it's it's in BL Ed in
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
that column so this book gives you an
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
extra level of detail on that particular
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
fund but you don't need to call it a
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
trust in order to get that reporting you
 
00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:42.039 align:start position:0%
just give it a dedicated fund number and
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
it goes you call it a trust then the
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
next question is who are the trustees
 
00:32:48.629 --> 00:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
correct like there's and and and the
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
answer is
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
huh in some of those cases there was
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
original legislation that established
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
who who manages the funds or the trust
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
but in the legal terms it's not
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily addressed thank you Senator
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
U Rosen thank you but specifically in
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
reference the opioid abatement trust
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
fund it um when that whole chapter was
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
established the name of the fund was
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
called the trust fund it's really a
 
00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:22.870 align:start position:0%
called the trust fund it's really a
settlement

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
fund we would have to change the
 
00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.909 align:start position:0%
fund we would have to change the
underlying

00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
statute to change the name of that and
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
there's reluctance to go and keep
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
reopening that statute for various
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
reasons I would agree I I I don't know
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
if that's something you'd want to do in
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
a future year I mean again this is this
 
00:33:48.509 --> 00:33:48.519 align:start position:0%
can be done in Steps step one was to
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
reorganize 612 so that it makes sense
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
with how we're reporting and what things
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
really are step two would be whether you
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
want to remove the word trust from
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere that it's not really a trust
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
and then you would be opening up the
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
original um statute the underlying
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
statute that not just in 612 but
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
whatever created it because keep in mind
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
everything that in 612 comes with a
 
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
partner statute El yes what one thing I
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
would like to add is that this this
 
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
section if you if you recall this has a
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
definition of a trust um so so um I
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
think perhaps going forward as
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
legislation is being um
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
um oppose uh folks should look at the
 
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
definition of trust to really understand
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be a trust or what kind
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
of fun is being created um in the future
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
uh going back to uh um Senator Rosen W
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
your your point about the opu bement
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
trust that one the language has that the
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
treasure is a trusty so um my office is
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
going to look at that a little more
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
closely and and and understand if we are
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
actually compliant with that piece
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
because when the law goes to the extent
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
to say that uh the treasur is a trustee
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
I I I need to take a look second a look
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
at that Senator gray and then
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
representative Aly well I think
 
00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:10.839 align:start position:0%
that if we can't come up with a good
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
name to substitute for the word trust
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
way to do it is to make a definition in
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
the front of 612 somewhere that says
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
although These funds bing bing bing bing
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
bing bing bing are not true trusts
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
because true trusts are in 612 whatever
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know they are and then Define them
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know and and I would agree with that
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
the other thing is sometimes but I've
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
had conversations with Department of
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
Justice about the war trust and some of
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
them when they read it when they read
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
some of some of the laws they really
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
think it should be considered trust even
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
though but but because of the way they
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
were written or the way the program
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
works sometimes he can't function as a
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
trust even though the language and the
 
00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
law um discusses that it should be a
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
trust and treated as such so there's
 
00:36:07.069 --> 00:36:07.079 align:start position:0%
some confusion as to but they will be
 
00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
able while this bill goes through the
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
legislature they will be able to bring
 
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.160 align:start position:0%
up all those things okay and if they
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
don't like our language then we can
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
argue about it for the whole
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
year representative oh I was just going
 
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
to say I wouldn't want to get it lost in
 
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
the you know again goal number one was
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
reorganized SU 12 so while the trust
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
language we've been living with that
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
reality for many years I I guess I
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want that to sort of sink our
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
ship the chair has offered so many
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
independent amendments this could just
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
be another one yeah okay representative
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
oming thank you um I don't see
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
why settlements can't be considered
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
trusts with a small t as they are
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
defined in the 167 168 that are going to
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
be moved to the front of this document
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
once they're in the front of the
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
document that should make it
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
easier because they are based on a or
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we needed more of a definition
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
than what we've got there in 167
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
168 but that
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
are that are maintained under legal
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
agreements that the state has to follow
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
I mean establishing us the law is Step
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
number one right so if if legislators
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
want to create a trust and and is um
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
enacting a law so that's step that's
 
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
step one perhaps step two is to have a
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
document to go with that sometimes I I I
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
am the trustee of some trust that have a
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
document but there are others that just
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
function as programs of the state so
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's the that's the
 
00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
complication well the ones that function
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
as programs of the state
 
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
aren't aren't they things we can change
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
without having to go to the AG's office
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
I believe so that you just would write a
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
different law yeah so they shouldn't be
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
trusts that that's and I agree that the
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
educ I remember that discussion about
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund quite well uh
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
it was put put in there to tell the
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
citizens that we were
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
purpose right and I think like the
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
opioid where the basis for that fund is
 
00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
settlement dollars but the legislature
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
decided what to do with those dollars it
 
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't an outside party it wasn't a
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
legal necessarily document that decided
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
that it was the legislative bill that
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
set forth how to spend those dollars
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
where to put
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
them Senator I mean based on
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
settlements with these companies we are
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
obligated to spend them to mitigate
 
00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
opioid harms right the purpose spend
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
them on any other purpose we could lose
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
them in the future so maybe trust isn't
 
00:39:20.589 --> 00:39:20.599 align:start position:0%
exactly the right word but right the
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
terms of the negotiated
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
settlements require that we spend them
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
in a certain way right for the I will
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
say the umbrella opioid abatement
 
00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079 align:start position:0%
purpose but then what you do what
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
decisions you make under that umbrella
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
is subject to legislation so it's it's I
 
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's one that's sort of
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
in between it's not a small tea it's not
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
a large tea I you know it's just the
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement is about halfway to
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
that same same level we we make
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
decisions on how to do certain things
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
and then they interfere if we're getting
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
too far away
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
from what will give us the money right
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
but I mean every
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
year Jim buetti at the Department of
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
Justice has to certify to all these drug
 
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and Distributors and
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and pharmacies that they
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
have been spent in accordance with the
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement so I
 
00:40:34.109 --> 00:40:34.119 align:start position:0%
mean um it's we're not really far away
 
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
from it like we are with tobacco it's
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
something he has to do every
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
year this gets done every year too does
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
it but it's also Complicated by being
 
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
across all well so is is opioid across
 
00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.750 align:start position:0%
across all well so is is opioid across
all

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
states any further questions uh for the
 
00:40:58.589 --> 00:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
treasur and controller on this matter
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
I would like to see an effort to put it
 
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
into some kind of a definition in the
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
front that says the purpose of what
 
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to accomplish by moving
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
some of these trusts you know because I
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
just looked up Websters you know and it
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
you know money or or something of value
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
that's held I mean so that definition
 
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
they all fit
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
into so
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
trying to say that you know if a trust
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
has you know a founding document and you
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
know trust these and and and and all of
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
those are in this other section then I
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
think that we can get there all right
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm coming to the conclusion that
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
what we have in front of us is not quite
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
ready to be put in word for word as a
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
bill it needs it needs a little bit more
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
tweaking in particular uh the definition
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
area also the movement of section 167
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
and 168 to the front I think would make
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
sense so can I suggest that perhaps this
 
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
would make a bill a good subject of a
 
00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
bill to be sponsored by Representatives
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
Aly and
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
Janan um and go to their committee and
 
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
that committee can work on the details
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the treasurer and
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
and uh comproller certainly fine with me
 
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
yes yes do we agre I'm sure the house
 
00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
will do a great job all right Senator
 
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
gray even even with bills coming out of
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the past
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
years um when you go to OS for drafting
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay they rarely come out the way you've
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
sent them in sure okay and that's a
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
reality and so that this recommends that
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
the bill say this is fine but you as a
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislature have the ability to modify
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
what you put your name on for sponsoring
 
00:43:14.829 --> 00:43:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
have yeah it's going to be a lot more
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
discussion obviously all right so
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
but the point is you have you have a
 
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
month or so before the deadline so you
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
can you can get together with them and
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
and right knock out some details that
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
way okay all right thank you now um so I
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
think we're done with that um I actually
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
had a question based on one of our other
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
funds for the treasurer as long as she's
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
here and that is um one of the last ones
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
that were sort of an open question was
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
in the Department of
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
Education and its fund
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
number let's see here uh School building
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
authority number 178 on the spreadsheet
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
item so the reason I'm bringing this up
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
is I I had a discussion I spoke for
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
maybe a half hour today to the chair of
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
the school building authority which is
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative Hill and and the
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
treasurer happens to be a member of the
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
school building
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
authority and
 
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.030 align:start position:0%
authority and
um

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:38.839 align:start position:0%
so this is a fund that we've been
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
putting $5,000 a year into for the last
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
three years and there's been no spending
 
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:46.839 align:start position:0%
and the reason is that representative
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
Hill didn't know that the fund
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
exists and he has no need for it so you
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
know we'll talk about getting rid of it
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
in a moment but but my question for you
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
uh madam treasure in particular is if
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
you look at the the law language that
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
creates the school building
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
authority one of the big items there is
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
they allow school projects to be
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
guaranteed by the state and there and
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
that in particular there's up to a $95
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
million total guarantee that the state
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
is allowed to to do and what
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
representative Hill told me is that all
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
that is obsolete because school projects
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
now go under some other area of Law and
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
they no longer need this state guarantee
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
correct all I know is that it hasn't
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
been used and I know most schools go
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
through for example the municipal bomb
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
bank for their projects um and so the um
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
the pce that really happens with school
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
Bill and eight is is really the grant
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
part of not not the bond fing part it
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't so it doesn't come to the State
 
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:01.559 align:start position:0%
anymore schools don't use the guarantee
 
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
it goes through the uh bom Bank the bom
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
Bank provides them a good deal
 
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
essentially um more better than them
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
going by themselves and the bond bank is
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
in law in some other chapter and I'm
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
also a member of the board okay fine
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you the question representative W
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
question arises when you go for a bond
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
rating and they look at our overall debt
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
is this in included in the overall debt
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
it is not it is not it it is not um no
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
the for our rating they only look at
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
what's outstand what the state has
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
outstanding um they understand some of
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
the moral obligations of the state but
 
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
but that's the extent it becomes really
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
critical if for example um like the
 
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:51.079 align:start position:0%
business Finance Authority for example
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
they they the state also guarantees some
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
of their bond or most of their bonds if
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
they were to uh default that will be the
 
00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.829 align:start position:0%
they were to uh default that will be the
problem

00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:47:04.589 --> 00:47:04.599 align:start position:0%
but for example a BFA has enough um
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
protections and and and and layers to
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that they're not they're
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
protecting themselves first to make sure
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
the state doesn't have to end up um
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
paying um that debt well like you I'm
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
very very cognizant of the fact that if
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
we get too deep in debt that our bond
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
rating goes down and the borrowing rates
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
go up so I'm delighted that it's not
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
included in the overall debt thank you
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
it is not we're constantly watching that
 
00:47:35.549 --> 00:47:35.559 align:start position:0%
as part of our debt affordability
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
study thank you thank you so
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative W
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
so what that means is we can just leave
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
it the way we've got
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
it as I understand it but well what I'm
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
going to propose is that since this
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
whole SE that whole
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
chapter um requires a more significant
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh bill that it won't be part of our
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
bill but we will I will together with
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Hill put in a bill to to
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
make a more significant change that
 
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
whole chapter including removing the
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund and the $8 a day that his
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
committee is supposed to be paid and you
 
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
know some other other stuff that's
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
obsolete there so
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:48:28.829 --> 00:48:28.839 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much any other
 
00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the treasurer or
 
00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
controller today thank you thank you
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
very much ladies okay all right so now

let's go on to our final report
 
00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
here and since we just got it presuma
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
since we just got it presumably we will
 
00:48:49.349 --> 00:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
like to read
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
it before we vote
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
on we have it we have it isn't it this
 
00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:01.109 align:start position:0%
on we have it we have it isn't it this

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
I counted up all the repeal counted up
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
all the repeals and it's actually only
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
281 dedicated funds now which I'm
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
delighted because when we talk about we
 
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
got more than 300 dedicated funds and
 
00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
we're not going to add another one are
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.269 align:start position:0%
 
about

01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:22.279 align:start position:0%

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
all right so let's go Page by page and
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
if we have any corrections on a given
 
01:03:56.269 --> 01:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
page we'll
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
go over them all right the first page
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
any I don't think there's anything no

oh okay and um I would add a sentence at
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
the end of that um the chair and SBA
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
chair will cooperate on
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
legislation or on this legislation
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
something like that Mr chair yes Senator
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
phrase uh the well the committee
 
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
recommends future
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
legislation to propose changes to
 
01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
modernize School building authority
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
statutes overall goes beyond the scope
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
committee um and we don't know what
 
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to be proposing so I I'm
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
hoping that we you don't want to commit
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
to it in advance right no I was hoping
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
we could just say recommends future
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
legislation to propose changes to the
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
provision for member compensation and
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
related fund and then anything else that
 
01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that's not related to
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds wouldn't be part of
 
01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.070 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds wouldn't be part of
this

01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
report all right so you're you just want
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
to remove the words to
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
modernize um
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
well School building authority statutes
 
01:08:28.799 --> 01:08:30.749 align:start position:0%
well School building authority statutes
overall

01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:08:30.759 --> 01:08:32.990 align:start position:0%
overall
including

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
the or I mean including so that would
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
say the committee
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
recommends future legislation to propose
 
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
changes to the provision for member
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
compensation gotcha and the related fund
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
because that's really what we've talked
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
about to modernize okay so we're going
 
01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
to cross out the words modernized School
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
building authority statutes overall
 
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
comma including yes thank you okay and
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
um are you okay with having me add the
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
sentence the chair and the SBA chair
 
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
legislation sure I mean you obviously
 
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
can do whatever you want sure but but I
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
mean that's our intention so don't point
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
it on just just to who's doing it kind
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
of right right and not what you're doing
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
but who
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean who were sort of assigning
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
this task to kind of thing okay all
 
01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
right other changes to this page I just
 
01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
like to say on that one the entire
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
education statutes needs this kind of
 
01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:48.829 align:start position:0%
education statutes needs this kind of
upgrade

01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
upgrade
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
so well remember one at a time remember
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
that the bill was in to to redo the
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
whole statute but we also have a statute
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
that says the people that are supposed
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
to be in charge that are LBA and that
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
didn't sit well with the education
 
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
people so they kind of nixed the the re
 
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
right is that the one we put 100,000 in
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
to hire a lawyer to go through yep and
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
then I put in another 100,000 for the
 
01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.310 align:start position:0%
then I put in another 100,000 for the
LBA

01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
LBA
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer and that didn't go well with the
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
education people than they want to be
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know the fox in charge of the the
 
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.790 align:start position:0%
you know the fox in charge of the the
hen

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
hen
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
house okay and I don't want them to be
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
that I swear they've got stuff about Ox
 
01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
carts in
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
there it's
 
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
just um and they have the same subject
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
interpretations on so exactly the chair
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
and S ba a chair will
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
collaborate yes I I had the word
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
cooperate but
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
four uh oh yeah
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
09 and then they they removed the
 
01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism in 17 and then they
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
put back another funding mechanism in
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
19 it's got a lot more history than that
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so on this one I how about last
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
modified in 19 yeah
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
okay okay last modified okay instead of
 
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.110 align:start position:0%
okay okay last modified okay instead of
establish

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
establish
 
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm not sure I reported on this
 
01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
but I I spoke extensively well I spoke
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
to with the chair of this um there's a
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee that that deals with this and
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's um representative Mark
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
Pearson uh is the chair of that
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee and I spoke with him and
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
um because I told him maybe we should
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
repeal this entire chapter which was
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
200m I think um because nothing's ever
 
01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
been done right and his committee hasn't
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
met and things like that and he wasn't
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
willing to go that far what he wanted to
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
do was put in a study committee to
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
decide what is appropriate for this
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
area and um so I backed off a little bit
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
and um I'm willing to do that with him
 
01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if we need to say all
 
01:13:04.149 --> 01:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
that stuff here so yeah I guess given
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
that oh okay the rest of that is all
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
right so I take it Senator Ros didn't
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
have any other changes correct okay
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you all right anything else on

of what are
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
to Define to Define and and right uh
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
created a
 
01:14:07.629 --> 01:14:07.639 align:start position:0%
section of the whole def definition
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
section that that explains this before
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
we get into one two three four right so
 
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
first of all it should be State
 
01:14:18.990 --> 01:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
Treasurer mespelli and comproller Dana
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%

call right yeah because they're together
on

01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh so that we reflect the AL book
 
01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
stuff um comma provide
 
01:14:35.719 --> 01:14:39.870 align:start position:0%
stuff um comma provide
guidance

um add
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
definitions oh and add definitions okay

definitions of trust
 
01:15:12.669 --> 01:15:12.679 align:start position:0%
funds okay
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
repealing the deleting the word trust
 
01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:20.230 align:start position:0%
from funds which are not TRS okay
 
01:15:20.230 --> 01:15:22.149 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:15:30.629 --> 01:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
funds that do not
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:48.590 align:start position:0%
 
definitions

01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay my concern those may be refer to
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
another places well yeah when you rename
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
something they do a global search and
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
rename it
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere yeah I mean that's just the
 
01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
normal part of the drafting process at
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
least it is
 
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
recently or it should be yeah it is okay
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to mention here that
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
you guys are going to do it I'm going to
 
01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:17.719 align:start position:0%
put that at the end okay
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
okay all right so what we have
 
01:16:20.679 --> 01:16:22.910 align:start position:0%
okay all right so what we have
is

01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
um so that it's the treasurer and the
 
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.510 align:start position:0%
um so that it's the treasurer and the
controller

01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
controller
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
um request requesting the transfer to
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
the accounting system Etc
 
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
and um add definitions of trust
 
01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.750 align:start position:0%
and um add definitions of trust
funds

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
um in including
 
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
definitions are you was okay with that
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
Jennifer yeah okay good anything else on
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
this page maybe renaming and
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
reclassifying in C or
 
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
D re renaming and clar and classifying
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
as C or
 
01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:16.790 align:start position:0%
as C or
D

01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay any go ahead just to follow up
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
on that what happens in cases where the
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
it's been in statute somewhere else and
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
given that name and now we're renaming
 
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
it how I mean I guess how is that
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
reconciled or is it reconciled by the
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
fact that we have a new statute that
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
says I guess that's what it is we're now
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
renaming your bill would you know if
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
it's in RSA
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
1234 uh fund such and such right that
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
your bill would have a line that says
 
01:17:58.110 --> 01:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
change change you know amend RSA
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
1234 you know fund such and such is now
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
fund thus and so right you know so it
 
01:18:08.430 --> 01:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
and it's now in section well if it so so
 
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
your bill will not just amend chapter 6
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
but it will also amend chapter 1 two 3 4
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
where it changes the but it would just
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
be a name change right we had that with
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
dogs and cats with the agriculture
 
01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
program you remember how complicated
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
that got yeah yeah renaming yeah a lot
 
01:18:32.229 --> 01:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
of name changes yeah an example would be
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
when they change the name of a
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
department or split or combine a
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
department is that you end up with a
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill that is multiple pages long because
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
every time that department is listed
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
they have to go in and put the statute
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah I I have a bill um that
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
changes the responsibility from the
 
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
attorney general to the state so all
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of places where it
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
crosses off attorney general and changes
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
it to State and then but it's but it's
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
really w a global change anyways so at
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
the bottom of that one I wanted to point
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
fund oh okay so again you want the
 
01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
accounting unit there is that it yes
 
01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:27.310 align:start position:0%
accounting unit there is that it yes
okay

01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.669 --> 01:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
discuss finance division one sorting out
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
the 16 off book funds in 168 all right
 
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
so this is left over from last year ah
 
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
so I asked
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
any kind of ongoing thing related to the
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
budget um that was in last year's report
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
I asked Jennifer to continue in this
 
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
report just so it would help me remember
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
it for Budget time right good is that
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
all right yep okay yeah that was a last
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
year thing okay and you also have
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
appendix D in this which is the
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
treasures proposal to clean up the off
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
