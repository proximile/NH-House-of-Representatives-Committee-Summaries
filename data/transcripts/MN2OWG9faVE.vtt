understanding that this is all about
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
transparency and Public Safety
 
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.769 align:start position:0%
transparency and Public Safety
um

00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
as I Look to page two
 
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
the first complete paragraph
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
where the second sentence says this
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
would include non-voluntary license or
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
privileged verifications or suspensions
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
in any malpractice suits found in favor
 
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:04.940 align:start position:0%
of the plaintiff over the past 10 years
 
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's all well and good that it doesn't
 
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
preclude the possibility that a provider
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
May voluntarily a provider who has
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
caused harm
 
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
May voluntarily
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
surrender the license for a period of
 
00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:18.170 align:start position:0%
surrender the license for a period of
time

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.670 align:start position:0%
time
without

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
you know invoking any kind of um inquiry
 
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
and so that to me not that I in any way
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
shape or form and and disparaging the
 
00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:31.019 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine or those who do it
 
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
but it is a liability within the
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
existing law and and so I already said
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
but then they had proposed um uh law and
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's something that the
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
committee should address
 
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
committee should address
yeah

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:46.339 align:start position:0%
representative Solway sorry
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
I think that a good Senator has made a
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
very insightful point that there is a
 
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
potential unintended consequence in the
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
word in the wording in that
 
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.410 align:start position:0%
word in the wording in that
um

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
those who would otherwise be subject
 
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
to disciplinary action may be encouraged
 
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:11.180 align:start position:0%
to voluntarily
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
relinquish their privileges
 
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
and that would not be reported to the
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine as Senator Guida has
 
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
and we need to be careful perhaps simply
 
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:29.420 align:start position:0%
to remove the word non-voluntary
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
from the wording so that that unintended
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
consequence does not occur in addition
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
if I may go on for just a moment Mr
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
chairman I think we need a motion to
 
00:10:42.839 --> 00:10:43.930 align:start position:0%
chairman I think we need a motion to
accept

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:43.940 align:start position:0%
accept
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
this report and I'd like to enter that
 
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
motion to accept the report second and
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
seconded by Senator guide and now we may
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
discuss and the report that we have
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
received we may choose to amend the
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
reports which will be then a document of
 
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
this oversight committee so page two
 
00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
full paragraph one second sentence you
 
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
are suggesting striking the word
 
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
non-voluntary yes
 
00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339 align:start position:0%
yeah any thoughts about that
 
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:22.500 align:start position:0%
having served on that subcommittee I
 
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
Senator Gaia just looking at wording
 
00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:33.019 align:start position:0%
he's saying
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
would you turn your mic on please thank
 
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about a revocation
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
or a suspension
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
so we might want to say a surrender a
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
voluntary surrender
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
adding that wording because I don't
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
think technically if a person's
 
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
voluntarily surrenders a license that
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's a revocation or suspension it's
 
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.410 align:start position:0%
it's a revocation or suspension it's
non-disciplinary

they're pretty darn similar
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
which doesn't necessarily mean great
 
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
minds think alike but for the purpose of
 
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:48.980 align:start position:0%
this meeting I'd like to think that so
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is to establish a standing
 
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:54.180 align:start position:0%

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
to make ahead of time this would be the
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
time to do it
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
those of you who are not returning feel
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
coming up with an LSR that would
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
specifically mandate changes we would
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
come up instead with an oversight board
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
who would work with the Bureau of
 
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.450 align:start position:0%
who would work with the Bureau of
medicine

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.350 align:start position:0%
medicine
um

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
to look at all of these things
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
collectively and the reason is we did
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
our work in a month
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of wonderful things
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
were done but something that's put
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
together that fast you come to regret we
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
should have added this we shouldn't have
 
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
put that in there so I pulled back and I
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
know you did two representative from
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
actually mandating some changes
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
in an LSR but instead come up with this
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
oversight committee that would work on
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
things collaboratively and then make
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
some suggestions to the legislature for
 
00:21:45.289 --> 00:21:45.299 align:start position:0%
the future that was that's how this
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
fully understanding the import of what
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is going to do
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
I am not a believer in commissions
 
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.750 align:start position:0%
I am not a believer in commissions
because

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
conflicting interests potentially
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
can side rail a proposal
 
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm a much stronger believer in
 
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
legislative committees
 
00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
to which all interested parties are
 
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:26.990 align:start position:0%
to which all interested parties are
invited

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
invited
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
okay and present their testimony as to
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
the efficacy or non-efficacy of a
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
particular proposal
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
and allow those elected by the people of
 
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
okay to be the stewards of their safety
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
to make the final decision remembering
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
that it has to go through the
 
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
all right so my suggestion would be
 
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
um a committee comprised of senators and
 
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.470 align:start position:0%
um a committee comprised of senators and
representatives

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
to here okay
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
proposals on legislation from the
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
various members of this
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm I just believe that there's
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
a possibility of conflict of conflict
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
when it comes to an interest group that
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
might not see things the same way for
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
its own self-interest
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
not saying it couldn't happen that it
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
does happen but saying it could happen
 
00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
and thereby in fact Stonewall or delay
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
or in fact prevent
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
putting forth the changes that might
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
this commission as this draft LSR
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
outlines it would not preclude the fact
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
that any legislators could file
 
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.810 align:start position:0%
that any legislators could file
legislation

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
whether they are
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislative members of the commission or
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
not they could they could still do that
 
00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:44.810 align:start position:0%
not they could they could still do that
um

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
I was
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
very pleased
 
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
as we did our business as a subcommittee
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
how much Unity I heard from all the
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including the plaintiff and
 
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
defense malpractice lawyers we were all
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
really kind of looking for the same
 
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
thing to protect good doctors and
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Facilities from frivolous
 
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.350 align:start position:0%
hospitals and Facilities from frivolous
charges

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
charges
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
but also to protect the public from the
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
rare bad actor we all wanted the same
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
thing and we were pretty darn close as
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
we were talking as to how we could go
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
about making that happen better so I
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't personally I don't fear this
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
commission doing that and should they
 
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:33.169 align:start position:0%
commission doing that and should they
um

00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
any legislator can always say a pox on
 
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to file a bill
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
response if that legislator has access
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
to the information regarding the
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
well I would think the commission
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
meetings would be open and Good Records
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
would be kept and work product would be
 
00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
seen and if somebody even from the
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
get-go thinks this commission may not
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
quite be the way to go
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
they could come to our meetings
 
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.110 align:start position:0%
they could come to our meetings
follow-up

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not certain what effect HIPAA
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
has on the presentation of information
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
about a specific case
 
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
so the meetings may not be able to be
 
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.770 align:start position:0%
so the meetings may not be able to be
open

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:18.780 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
uh for that if I understand HIPAA that
 
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
protects the patient it does not
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily protect a professional from
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
Bad action the name or names of people
 
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
who allegedly were harmed would not be
 
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:40.490 align:start position:0%
who allegedly were harmed would not be
mentioned

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
you wish follow-up no that's my point
 
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative Solway uh thank you
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
um I believe that Senator Guida makes a
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
very good point that commissions may
 
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
very well in fact get gridlocked in
 
00:25:59.090 --> 00:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
conflicting opinions and I agree with
 
00:26:01.909 --> 00:26:01.919 align:start position:0%
him also that it is a responsibility of
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
the legislature and it's duly elected
 
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.409 align:start position:0%
the legislature and it's duly elected
representatives

00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:06.419 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
to safeguard the well-being of the
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
people in addition to Physicians
 
00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
hospitals and so forth I think the
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
process by which we can refine uh this
 
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
LSR is the amendment process
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
uh once filed and submitted to committee
 
00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:28.460 align:start position:0%
this is subject to Amendment
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
and I think the guiding document is the
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
report which uh the senator and I agree
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh needed to be amended we have done so
 
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
and if we set that out as the initial
 
00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:45.539 align:start position:0%
document to guide a committee or
 
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
commission we can file this LSR and
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
leave it to a committee on Health Human
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
Services and aging and elderly Affairs
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
to exercise its wisdom as the
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
s that made us a bit comfortable even
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
though we had to get all our work done
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
on this and on the next one we're going
 
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
to deal with is that although we had a
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
month to do this uh there will be a
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
month and a half to two months
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
to bring forth amendments on this I was
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
counting on that
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
so anything else
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
anybody okay
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
anybody who's returning who wants in on
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsorship
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
who can say that now or
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
once the once this is filed please let
 
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
me know
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
yeah you're already in there
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah you served on the
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
next item is the task force on Precision
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
medicine and biomarker testing
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
submission of task force we've got a a

everything that we learned in the
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
process of putting this together the
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
draft report is before you originally
 
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
this was a motion submitted by uh
 
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Catherine Rogers of
 
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:05.900 align:start position:0%
blessed memory
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
who herself was suffering from
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
um a debilitating disease and who had
 
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
benefited in ways from
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
um Precision medicine and biomarker
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
testing it was her desire that the
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
committee on Health Human Services and
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
submit legislation that would establish
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
a commission to further Precision
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
medicine and biomarker testing within
 
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:40.940 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
as admirable and intent as that was
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
our professional members on the
 
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.029 align:start position:0%
our professional members on the
subcommittee

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
representatives woods and Merchant in
 
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.049 align:start position:0%
representatives woods and Merchant in
particular

00:29:53.049 --> 00:29:53.059 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
alerted the subcommittee to the fact
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
that biomarker testing was a um
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
was a medical technology procedure that
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
had great promise and was being tested
 
00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:10.980 align:start position:0%
but that the concept of precision
 
00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:12.289 align:start position:0%
but that the concept of precision
medicine

00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
and its outcome for people who were
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
disease had not been proven it had not
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
been clinically demonstrated and it was
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
their recommendation and dare I say
 
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
their wisdom that the subcommittee could
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
in fact encourage the establishment of a
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
commission on biomarkers but that the
 
00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:38.059 align:start position:0%
overall concept of precision medicine
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
needed to wait for further testing and
 
00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
approvals as a result of that the
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
committee has suggested a rather
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
different approach and that is the
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
establishment of a forgive me Senator
 
00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
Guida a commission on emerging medical
 
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.990 align:start position:0%
Guida a commission on emerging medical
Technologies

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
Technologies
 
00:31:02.169 --> 00:31:02.179 align:start position:0%
giving us a tool to assess new medical
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
Technologies on a continuing basis and
 
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:09.299 align:start position:0%
to determine what the effect of those
 
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:12.299 align:start position:0%
emerging medical Technologies
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
um might be on the cost for example to
 
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.029 align:start position:0%
um might be on the cost for example to
Medicaid

00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have Mr lippman here with us director
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid who may or may not wish to
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
speak to that issue but his
 
00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:30.539 align:start position:0%
representative on the committee was
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
quite informative on the fact that these
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
are very expensive procedures and we
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at that we needed to
 
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
take a look at who was innovating where
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
the Innovations were coming from whether
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
they were academic whether they were
 
00:31:45.419 --> 00:31:47.049 align:start position:0%
they were academic whether they were
entrepreneurial

00:31:47.049 --> 00:31:47.059 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
what the risks might be to our patient
 
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
population and so
 
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee suggested that we
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
establish establish
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
an ongoing Commission on emerging
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies and that is covered
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh to in my deathless prose uh on the
 
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.029 align:start position:0%
uh to in my deathless prose uh on the
report

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
which I'm now submitting to uh the
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and uh then we have
 
00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
a draft LSR that will accompany so
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I would like to move the
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
acceptance of the report to the
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
oversight committee with regard to
 
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
Senator Guida seconds
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Nelson
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Cameron where did the FED fed sit in
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
this has this already been done
 
00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:51.059 align:start position:0%
um this type of testing to show that the
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
results were were good and it's really
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
working on a federal level where there
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
would be a wider testing procedure uh uh
 
00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's an
 
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
um our representative who came to us
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
from the Medicaid office went over with
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
us what the Federal Regulations look
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
like in terms of what State Medicaid can
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
support or not support typically we rely
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
on the FDA the federal Food and Drug
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
Administration to determine what uh
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
technologies have been proven and what
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
have not and
 
00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
we assume representative
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
that they act in a good faith and with
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
due regard for the principles of science
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh with out any other interests imposing
 
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Guida thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
um I want to key on representative
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
soloway's remarks about commission
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
versus committee
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
and I I think he highlighted it this
 
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
commission okay none of the members of
 
00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:06.299 align:start position:0%
this commission would be subject
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
potentially to punitive action or
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
litigation because of their actions with
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
respect to the previous item on the
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
agenda that's not the case I'd just like
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
to make that point
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
any further comments on the report of
 
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee
 
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
on Precision medicine again thank you so
 
00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment or two on the first
 
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.470 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment or two on the first
page

00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
the report as given does not list all of
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
I believe sir that that was amended
 
00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.230 align:start position:0%
I believe sir that that was amended
appropriately

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
how so
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
who did I miss you mentioned
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative Jerry Cannon and
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Betty gay in your opening
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
oh yes and I did submit
 
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:20.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative Canon as well and
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative you must have a newer
 
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
version then
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
there were four as I recall
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
I have it on mine sir
 
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
oh good thank you is that your copy or
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
do you have another one well no I mean
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
I'll get another one and I can only
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
assure you sir that representative gay
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
made a phone call in which he pointed
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
out those omissions quite directly after
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
which the changes were made
 
00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.210 align:start position:0%
which the changes were made
also

00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:35:59.220 --> 00:35:59.870 align:start position:0%
also
um

00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
I would ask the correct spelling of
 
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
Representative Roger's first name that
 
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
has also been changed sir
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh not on the most recent Edition I just
 
00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:13.550 align:start position:0%
uh not on the most recent Edition I just
got

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
got
 
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.410 align:start position:0%
got
um

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
sir I was not a liberal arts major
 
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.210 align:start position:0%
sir I was not a liberal arts major
um

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:25.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
k-a-t-h-e-r-i-n-e I believe it I believe
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
so but that's not what I have here that
 
00:36:31.609 --> 00:36:31.619 align:start position:0%
was supposed to have been changed it may
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
appear elsewhere and have been changed
 
00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.450 align:start position:0%
appear elsewhere and have been changed
elsewhere

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
and I know I made at least one change
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
I think since we will be
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
archiving this as part of our committee
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
also on
 
00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
page two at least on my copy everywhere
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
k-a-t-h-e-r-i-natural okay good good
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
good and so Mr Clark in whatever Edition
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
you're archiving uh it needs to be up to
 
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:29.089 align:start position:0%
you're archiving uh it needs to be up to
that

00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further corrections
 
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
to the report we have a motion before us
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
made by representative Solway and
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
seconded by Senator Guida that we
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
receive the report of the sub committee
 
00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:48.200 align:start position:0%
on Precision medicine and biomarkers
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
I opposed that looks like
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
7-Zip okay good thank you now let's go
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
to the draft LSR which should be stapled
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
I'm learning to the report
 
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:09.410 align:start position:0%
I'm learning to the report
um

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.450 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:13.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
but you want to go to draft LSR where it
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
and again Catherine yes
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
spelled correctly
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.849 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
I was asked to be co-sponsor or prime
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
sponsor on this because representative
 
00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
soloway is breaking my heart he didn't
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
also um if you go down near to the
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
bottom where it's lowercase G the New
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Cancer Society will not be
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
sending a representative because there
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
is no New Hampshire Society it's the
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
that change has been made in a later
 
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:19.069 align:start position:0%
that change has been made in a later
Edition

00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:21.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
are there other changes that have been
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
made in later editions because I'm I've
 
00:39:28.609 --> 00:39:28.619 align:start position:0%
got to walk something down to
 
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
um OLS and I want to make sure I have
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
the most up-to-date addition that should
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
be it sir okay
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
so take a minute folks everybody and
 
00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
read it if you haven't already
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:54.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:54.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
suggestions that you would want to make
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
before this is filed as legislation and
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
if there's any other members of the
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee and that would include the
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
clerk and representative McMahon and
 
00:40:09.849 --> 00:40:09.859 align:start position:0%
Senator gray if any of you wish to be
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this let me know either
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
Senator gray in the Senate the fastest
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
way to get on that committee is to
 
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor yeah so if you don't have
 
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.710 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor yeah so if you don't have
time

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:40:35.089 --> 00:40:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
is that a statement of willingness
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
or unwillingness
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
I think it's a statement of fact
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you have you ever considered a
 
00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
career in politics
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%

Hospital
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
um was there since 1974 and we do have a
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
hundred acres of property there and this
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
picture does not necessarily do it
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
justice there is a lot of opportunity
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
for our patients to have space within
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
the facility as well as outside open air
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
space swing sets things of those nature
 
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
that actually make it a little bit more
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
conducive for them to be able to have an
 
00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
environment for treatment that's geared
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
more towards children and adolescents
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
and young adults
 
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
and so as Deputy Commissioner
 
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
said the hospital was acquired by the
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
state in June of this year
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
and since that time
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
we also have been collaborating with the
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
well path Recovery Solutions team the
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
hospital is owned and operated we have
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
our rest of our leadership team here
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
with us as well today and their names
 
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
are are on our in the presentation as
 
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.569 align:start position:0%
are are on our in the presentation as
well

00:44:52.569 --> 00:44:52.579 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
this these are all Department of Health
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
and Human Services employees that are
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
overseeing the contract for wellpath and
 
00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:04.940 align:start position:0%
so wellpath is providing the services
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
and maintenance of the facility
 
00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.339 align:start position:0%
in the clinical Realm
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
and the other members of our executive
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
leadership team we do have
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
um Representatives as well from the well
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
path side that join in us to collaborate
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide the best quality
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
care that we had been previously doing
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
and continue to do but with under this
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
new contract system the executive
 
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
director on the well path side was the
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
long-standing chief nursing operator
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
that I worked with for decades there so
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
the vision continues which is aligned
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
very much with the state's vision for
 
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:53.780 align:start position:0%
the services that we're able to provide
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
we are operating our units we have one
 
00:45:59.770 --> 00:45:59.780 align:start position:0%
young adult unit
 
00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
which takes care of patients that are
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
older adolescents 17 up through age 25
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
depending on their presentations
 
00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:17.420 align:start position:0%
um the other three units are A variation
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
and spend the majority of their days
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
focusing on ages four up through around
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
11 12 and then another unit houses
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
ages 13 14 up through 18 and then our
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
third children's unit
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh also handles taking care of patients
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
that have developmental disabilities as
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
well as
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
more significant behavioral health
 
00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.190 align:start position:0%
more significant behavioral health
challenges

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we actually
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
had done as an executive team is we
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
actually had broadened the scope and
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
looked at our new mission and vision and
 
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.450 align:start position:0%
looked at our new mission and vision and
values

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:07.460 align:start position:0%
values
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
since being acquired by the state and
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
really aligning those things and really
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
looking and taking into consideration
 
00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:17.819 align:start position:0%
the 10-year mental health plan as well
 
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
as collaborating within the system of
 
00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:21.309 align:start position:0%
as collaborating within the system of
care

00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and really aligning
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
our mission and vision to work with
 
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
those things as well so our new mission
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
statement you have is to provide
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed patient and family
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
centered mental health treatment in an
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
accepting and supporting environment
 
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
um and then our vision is to really be
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
that Center of Excellence for mental
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
health treatment for children youth and
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
young adults and adolescents
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
and that is really truly what we are all
 
00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.990 align:start position:0%
and that is really truly what we are all
about

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
um at Hampstead
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
um like I said we did bring our team
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
because we think it's important for you
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
all to see
 
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
um the rest of us that are that are all
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of the state taking care
 
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
so right now we're actually
 
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
um working with in collaboration with uh
 
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
wellpath to increase the bed capacity at
 
00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
Hampstead currently we're able to have
 
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:29.540 align:start position:0%
an average daily census of 37 patients
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
and with those efforts we're looking to
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
increase those that bed capacity so that
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
we would no longer hopefully have a wait
 
00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:41.420 align:start position:0%
list of patients in the Eds
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
our current average wait list is around
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
13 patients per day
 
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.490 align:start position:0%
13 patients per day
um

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
with the workforce challenges we
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
actually have
 
00:48:58.490 --> 00:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
um been able to secure different models
 
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
of programming
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
um we've been offering patients partial
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
hospitalization when we're not able to
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
have them full inpatient if that works
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
for them as well so there are different
 
00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.290 align:start position:0%
for them as well so there are different
um

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
challenges that we've been working with
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
the team and the rest of the system of
 
00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
care throughout New Hampshire
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
namely with dcyf and also with the
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
division of Behavioral Health
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
this is something that's been very
 
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
exciting for us be to be able to be part
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
of that system of care we work very
 
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.930 align:start position:0%
of that system of care we work very
closely

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
closely
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
um with them we have a long-standing
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
relationship with the state through our
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
previous contract but in addition to
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
that we've really been working closely
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
to assist to care for the patients
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
that are in need of different levels of
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
care so we meet regularly
 
00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
weekly actually more if needed to go
 
00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.430 align:start position:0%
weekly actually more if needed to go
over

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
different cases that are presenting that
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
may potentially go to a different
 
00:50:04.609 --> 00:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
facility or may need a different level
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
of care to really look at those
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
individuals and find the best place for
 
00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:11.579 align:start position:0%
them to be within the state and be able
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
to get them into an appropriate setting
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
for the level of care that they need
 
00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
for the level of care that they need
um

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
our parents and patient satisfaction
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
scores are at 90 percent
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
um satisfaction and we are very proud of
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
that and we strive to be able to have
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
that reach 100 someday
 
00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and as well the other
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
um interesting piece for us is that we
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
are very proud of our readmission rates
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
they are very low
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
they're currently at five percent for 30
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to hand it over to Steve
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you uh very much
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
for allowing us to be able to talk to
 
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
you today about the important and uh
 
00:51:08.089 --> 00:51:08.099 align:start position:0%
really great work that our teams uh at
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
Hempstead Hospital are doing uh what
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
you'll see on the next graph is really
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh a summation of our daily averages
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
that we're you know accepting and
 
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.010 align:start position:0%
that we're you know accepting and
discharging

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
discharging
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
um so what you can see here I think is
 
00:51:23.089 --> 00:51:23.099 align:start position:0%
is truly
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
um an understanding that we're
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
essentially getting the same amount of
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
patients in that we're discharging and
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
ultimately our goal as a team is to
 
00:51:34.329 --> 00:51:34.339 align:start position:0%
increase that our goal is to take
 
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
as many patients as we possibly can with
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
the ability that we have and currently
 
00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
as we'll talk about on the next slide
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
some of the barriers to those are are
 
00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
our staffing models right now and and
 
00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:50.540 align:start position:0%
the ability to get increased Staffing in
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
that in the complexity of patients that
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
we're taking
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
um there there's a level of complexity
 
00:51:58.370 --> 00:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
in the patients that we take that really
 
00:51:58.380 --> 00:51:59.290 align:start position:0%
in the patients that we take that really
require

00:51:59.290 --> 00:51:59.300 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of work and so those have been
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
some of our uh our our challenges in a
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
way of of taking in and discharging some
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
of those patients
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
um but again we continue to strive to
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
increase those numbers and I think as
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
you can see uh month over month where
 
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing uh we are doing that
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
um on the next side you'll see our
 
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
staffing positions
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm sure
 
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
um as we all
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
um look at Staffing positions across
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
many Industries uh Healthcare uh has has
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
really been hurt by uh by Staffing and
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
what you see here is is that our
 
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
executive team truly identified a couple
 
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
of the key positions that we needed here
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
at the hospital in order to really truly
 
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
take care of our patients and and those
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
would be nurses and counselors and so we
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
did work with our our well path partners
 
00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
and the contractor in order to truly
 
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
identify identify unique ways and out of
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
the box ways and thinking of of getting
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
those Staffing numbers up and as you'll
 
00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:07.069 align:start position:0%
those Staffing numbers up and as you'll
see

00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
um you know we're pretty proud of where
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
we're at particularly on the nursing
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
side we went from about a 61 percent
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
filled rate to right now or about 82
 
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
percent filled uh in our nursing
 
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
positions which is which is really great
 
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
that provides us the opportunity to
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
truly care for these patients we're
 
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.230 align:start position:0%
truly care for these patients we're
continuing

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
um to work on the counselor positions
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
those are a little bit more uh
 
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:35.099 align:start position:0%
challenging to to fill but we are
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
looking at all all ways of of trying to
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
attract those positions and and again
 
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.140 align:start position:0%
we feel very confident that we'll be
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
able to do that and that will allow us
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
to continue to to take more children and
 
00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:52.910 align:start position:0%
to continue to to take more children and
to

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
provide that high level of care one of
 
00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
the great things that I I think uh is
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
worth noting you know truly is our
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
ability since uh being a state entity at
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
this point is
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
um our ability to work collaboratively
 
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.710 align:start position:0%
um our ability to work collaboratively
across

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
across
 
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
um Health and Human Services and with
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
our partners to truly understand that
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
we're taking more complex patients but
 
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
but how we're taking those patients and
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
their their the care that they're having
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
both before they get to us and truly
 
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
strategizing and collaborating on that
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
care that those children and the
 
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
services those children will get after
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
they leave us
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
um that you know I think it's really
 
00:54:34.619 --> 00:54:36.049 align:start position:0%
um that you know I think it's really
important

00:54:36.049 --> 00:54:36.059 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:38.700 align:start position:0%
um as we continue to tell ourselves and
 
00:54:41.809 --> 00:54:41.819 align:start position:0%
our teams that you know these patients
 
00:54:43.970 --> 00:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
um their care doesn't stop just with us
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
right it's that collaboration and that
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
and that care that goes beyond well
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
beyond what happens after they leave our
 
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.670 align:start position:0%
beyond what happens after they leave our
doors

00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
doors
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
we do you often meet with our external
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
partners and it's something that I find
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
both very rewarding and I to me gives
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
our teams the ability to truly have a
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive strategic approach to
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
taking care of our kids
 
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:10.670 align:start position:0%
taking care of our kids
um

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
and you know I think another big piece
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
of what we are trying to do here at
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital is is not only look
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
at the the level of treatment and care
 
00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
that we're giving our children today but
 
00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:26.099 align:start position:0%
but also looking at 2023 and Beyond what
 
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
are we doing now and how can we continue
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
to provide this level of care and and I
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
think you know as Kathy alluded to you
 
00:55:35.569 --> 00:55:35.579 align:start position:0%
know the 10-year mental health plan that
 
00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:36.740 align:start position:0%
was developed
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
by a lot of you
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
really sets the tone and gives us sort
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
of a guiding path as to how we want to
 
00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
continue to move forward uh to care for
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
those children in New Hampshire
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're very proud
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
of is our psychiatric residential
 
00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:56.220 align:start position:0%
treatment facility which will be opening
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
up hopefully by the end of the first
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
quarter in 2023 this will be the first
 
00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:03.800 align:start position:0%
type of this facility in New England
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
typically right now we you know we these
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
these type of patients
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
we're not able to care for here in New
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so our ability to bring
 
00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
these kids back home so that they can
 
00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
develop and get that treatment here not
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
only with the support of our teams but
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
the support of their families and and
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
state resources I think uh is is really
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
really important
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that I think is
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
equally as important to both attracting
 
00:56:38.809 --> 00:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
uh attracting folks to come work for uh
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
Hempstead hospital but also retaining
 
00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
the folks we have is really developing
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
that culture and we are working with our
 
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:47.339 align:start position:0%
external Partners we have you know great
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
guidance from our leadership at HHS as
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
well as our collaborative partners with
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital to truly
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
understand what it is to be you know a
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
state run facility and how we as a
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
state-run facility want to
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
want to truly be delivering that level
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
of care and so um I I think it's
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
something that we are constantly
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
retooling but but also find as a a
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
critical component to our successes
 
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
really setting that culture and ensuring
 
00:57:23.329 --> 00:57:23.339 align:start position:0%
that that folks want want to be there
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
and like like the work that they're
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
doing and then lastly I I think we're
 
00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
always again as our future focused is
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
that we are starting and preparing to
 
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:36.300 align:start position:0%
launch the procurement process of our
 
00:57:38.809 --> 00:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
longer term longer term excuse me
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
clinical contract and so as we continue
 
00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:45.780 align:start position:0%
to develop our processes for today we
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
are looking at the long term and and
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
really trying to better understand and
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
prepare and strategize as to how uh and
 
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
what Hampstead Hospital and residential
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
treatment facility looks like uh in in
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator guided with a question
 
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:05.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair actually I have
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
several with your Indulgence let's try
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
two and we'll come back okay
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
um the wait list averages 13 a day
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
where are they kept and how for how long
 
00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
do you have an average time that they're
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:27.950 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
so typically our
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
the patients are at the emergency room
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
in the emergency department and if they
 
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
are at the emergency room the average
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
time they are triaged the patients and
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
they actually for a high level triage
 
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
they are typically it is roughly four to
 
00:58:54.349 --> 00:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
six days that they're waiting
 
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
second question
 
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.109 align:start position:0%
second question
so

00:59:00.109 --> 00:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
it's distressing to see the low the the
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
low level of counselors that you have
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're working very hard in it
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
can you attribute that to any factors
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
obviously every Healthcare facility is
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
struggling but that seems
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh yeah so I I think there are multiple
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
factors in that in that
 
00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we've identified
 
00:59:23.339 --> 00:59:24.829 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we've identified
through

00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
um the contract was that well path
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
originally was was uh recruiting under
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
the the well path name and what we found
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
was well well path although is a
 
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
national company wasn't necessarily
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
recognized in this area
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of folks didn't you know
 
00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140 align:start position:0%
had trouble sort of getting to that
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
website and really applying for
 
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
positions and so working with the well
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
path team we really kind of identified
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
that as you know one we have to really
 
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
look beyond the the way that they were
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
in the the job postings that they were
 
00:59:59.329 --> 00:59:59.339 align:start position:0%
putting out number two we really wanted
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
to put the Hampstead Hospital you know
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
logo out there right because it's
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
recognizable to the community
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
um and we looked and
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
um you know through some research we
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
found that you know LinkedIn jobs is is
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh where a lot of hospitals today are
 
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
hiring from so we really wanted to make
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
sure that wellpath was utilizing those
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
type of resources as best as possible
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know where we're
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
continuing to to try to find unique ways
 
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
of getting folks in right and making
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
sure that they're the right folks right
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
and making sure that their
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications sort of hit where we want
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
that will be the best providing for our
 
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
for our teams and so
 
01:00:45.289 --> 01:00:45.299 align:start position:0%
um I think this is continual will
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
continue to be an uphill battle but
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
um I I've seen much more success over
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
the last you know couple of months than
 
01:00:55.329 --> 01:00:55.339 align:start position:0%
um how he how he started thank you
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Nelson
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman just
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
curious as to the nurses and counselors
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
how many of the counselors are full-time
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
versus part-time and
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:17.339 align:start position:0%
so the uh counselors are on duty there's
 
01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:20.339 align:start position:0%
nursing and counseling staff on 24 hours
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
a day
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and it varies with the number of
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
counselors and if you look at the number
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
of counselors It's it's skewed a little
 
01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
bit by the fact that there are many more
 
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
counselors on a day-to-day basis than
 
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
there are nurses so the the occupancy is
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
of that rate is is a little deceiving
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
um the number of full-time counselors I
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number but I can
 
01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
tell you that most of them are full-time
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
we used to have a very lengthy per diem
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
pool which has subsequently gone by the
 
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
wayside and we are only down to about
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
five or six per diem staff right now so
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
most of those are full-time employees
 
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:07.859 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
yes Minecraft follow-up and that number
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
of people full-time would be
 
01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.450 align:start position:0%
of people full-time would be
approximately

01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
um about uh I think it is around
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
85. 85 yeah
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
and what number of people are there
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
seven counselors or full-time or three
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
or no no we're talking about 85 ftes and
 
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
one FTE would each equal 40 hours so
 
01:02:32.819 --> 01:02:35.829 align:start position:0%
one FTE would each equal 40 hours so
okay

01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you I'm just
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
curious as to the average length of stay
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
and when discharged where do the
 
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
patients go typically
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's a it's a fantastic
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
um our our typical average length of
 
01:02:54.109 --> 01:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
stay obviously a lot depends on
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
um the the Acuity of those patients and
 
01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to answer your second
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
question first and that um part of what
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
part of the resources that we've had
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
since being becoming a state-run
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
facility is that we have that
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
collaborative approach with
 
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
um external resources like dcyf
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
um and and the Behavioral Health
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
Services which really help
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
um help us understand where these kids
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
are going to go next right A lot of them
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
go to residential treatment facilities
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
and and others are discharged back home
 
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
um with with resources in the community
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
that will help those kids
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
um and so you know every every patient
 
01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different
 
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
um and you know each patient has sort of
 
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
a different care plan that that allows
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
for their the best outcome for them in
 
01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
the long term right our goal truly is to
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are once they leave
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
the hospital that they they don't
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to come back right and
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
so providing them those those type of
 
01:03:56.329 --> 01:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
skills from a length of State
 
01:03:56.339 --> 01:03:57.950 align:start position:0%
skills from a length of State
perspective

01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
um you know our our our patients
 
01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.870 align:start position:0%
um you know our our our patients
typically

01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.530 align:start position:0%
typically
um

01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
you know are are here right around seven
 
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
to ten days right and and it again a lot
 
01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:11.339 align:start position:0%
of it depends on what they're coming in
 
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
for that real acute level of care
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
um but but a lot of times
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
that can vary right with with based on
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
where they're going after right and and
 
01:04:25.370 --> 01:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
how you know getting into the
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
residential facilities
 
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
um there's often as we talk about uh
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
Staffing challenges Right There Staffing
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
challenges there as well and so that can
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
at times cause some challenges of
 
01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
getting those those kids to the place in
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
an appropriate amount of time
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
um but again this is really truly where
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
the collaboration comes in and making
 
01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
sure that we have uh a plan of
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we're doing for
 
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
those kids while they're still in our
 
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
our care and then what the true truly
 
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:55.740 align:start position:0%
what the timeline is for them to get
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
follow up in um is there any type of
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
patient diagnosis that you do not take
 
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
um mental health diagnoses that you
 
01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:12.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.809 --> 01:05:14.819 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there probably would be one out
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
there if I said there was absolutely
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
none but I cannot think of anything that
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
we currently cannot treat
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
um with the
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
exception of any type of forensic truly
 
01:05:32.809 --> 01:05:32.819 align:start position:0%
forensic child and we are only a drf up
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
through age 17 so anybody that's not
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
voluntary Beyond age 17 18 and up great
 
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
you use the term nurse and
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
is there a breakdown between
 
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
RNs and LPNs and some of the newer
 
01:06:00.049 --> 01:06:00.059 align:start position:0%
qualifications of Nursing
 
01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
so we recently that was part of the
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
strategies as well
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so we are joint commission accredited
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
and we require to have a nurse an RN on
 
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
each unit each shift that has to be
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
solely designated for that unit
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
we previously had had LPNs in the past
 
01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
so we decided to start looking at
 
01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
utilizing LPNs to provide support for
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
the RNs and that actually attributes we
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
now have three LPNs total out of all of
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
our RNs that our LPNs that work side by
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
side with the nurses but they typically
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
tend to count in under the counselor
 
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:49.980 align:start position:0%
ratio because of the limitations of
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
their licensure
 
01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
I know that some facilities in the state
 
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
the nursing home in Rockingham County
 
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
being one of them realizes there's such
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
a shortage that they're bringing in
 
01:07:04.549 --> 01:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
people to train them on the job while
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
they're there in other words where three
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
of my aunts went a Hospital School of
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
Nursing yes yes
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
is that something possibly in the future
 
01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:16.609 align:start position:0%
is that something possibly in the future
here

01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
you never know I mean we would love to
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
see and see something like that I mean
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
we do have several schools that we have
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
come through with the nursing students
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that that is a a very
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
big boon with getting them to come back
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
if you like children and you're
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
interested in in Psych then coming and
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
doing your rotation there oftentimes
 
01:07:40.609 --> 01:07:40.619 align:start position:0%
they will come back and work for us we
 
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
also do the same thing with social
 
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:46.700 align:start position:0%
workers and we have a Residency program
 
01:07:49.609 --> 01:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
that is going to be starting in January
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
of this year for psychiatrists as well
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
I've done this in my facility of which
 
01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'm a CEO in Kingston and I continue to
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
like this as a possibility learning on
 
01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
the job and they give us X number of
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
years or months working with us and
 
01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:08.339 align:start position:0%
along the way we we get to know them and
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
so on sir absolutely I I think in
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
addition to that one of the things that
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
we've identified is truly building the
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
culture right to allow for that that's
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
right and and absolutely having that
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
level of commitment from all of our
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
staff so that those who do come in that
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
may be learning on the job
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
um feel that sense of community and
 
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
unity there so that it really wants them
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
to stay and give back and so that's one
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
of our differentiators we hope in
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
keeping folks uh here at Hampstead and
 
01:08:44.829 --> 01:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
and I think that will play a a very
 
01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
significant role as we move forward
 
01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
I have a few more questions have has the
 
01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
security coverage
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
protocol issue
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
been worked out because I know there was
 
01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.249 align:start position:0%
been worked out because I know there was
one

01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
between Hampstead police and other folks
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
the uh mou between DHHS and safety has
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
been signed
 
01:09:16.849 --> 01:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
and myself and our general counsel has
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
met with Hampstead Police Department
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
we've had a very good working
 
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
relationship with them as well and
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
they're also working with us to support
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
us through the whole the whole process
 
01:09:32.570 --> 01:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
and they are coming back in a few weeks
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
for us to continue those discussions
 
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
um and just kind of collaboration
 
01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:42.650 align:start position:0%
um and just kind of collaboration
good

01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.309 align:start position:0%
good
um

01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
I understand that roughly half of the
 
01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:48.500 align:start position:0%
payment and lieu of taxes has been made
 
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
when can we as a Hampstead taxpayer
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
expect the second payment
 
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
that is not something I have anyone know
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
the answer coming right up
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
hi everyone Melissa sancer Chief lead
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
officer for DHHS how are you
 
01:10:08.689 --> 01:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
um the second payment will be made when
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
the when we receive the bill for the
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
second half which I believe is in
 
01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.189 align:start position:0%
second half which I believe is in
December

01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
December
 
01:10:15.729 --> 01:10:15.739 align:start position:0%
the same time I get mine yeah
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
um who owns the responsibility for
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
making sure that this will continue in
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
because they're about to be my next best
 
01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:37.250 align:start position:0%
because they're about to be my next best
friend

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
um so we are working currently with the
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
governor's office to have that payment
 
01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:45.659 align:start position:0%
put into our budget yeah thank you
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:10:49.689 --> 01:10:49.699 align:start position:0%
any other questions for that about that
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
legal no no
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh would it be possible for a
 
01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:57.179 align:start position:0%
state representative who lives within
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
one mile of the facility to swing by and
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
have a tour please absolutely we welcome
 
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
everybody to come in even greater than
 
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
one mile absolutely okay I love to show
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you have the requisite staff we're
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
looking at percentages here if those
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
numbers went up to a hundred what would
 
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
your capacity be
 
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
we have the capacity for 70 inpatients
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
and then there will be those 12 beds for
 
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's another guy you had some more
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
so looking at the
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
I call it the incomplete percentages of
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
your personnel are is the workforce
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
01:11:54.169 --> 01:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
they're not they're all employed by well
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
path right and so are they represented
 
01:11:59.350 --> 01:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
union union representative or not
 
01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:02.540 align:start position:0%
they are currently in Union negotiations
 
01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Outlook
 
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
previous owners we had a collective
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement with the SEIU and
 
01:12:12.649 --> 01:12:12.659 align:start position:0%
they're currently negotiating that yep
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
one question
 
01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.950 align:start position:0%
one question
um

01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
are your pay rates competitive is that
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that perhaps you
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
might not have as many people coming
 
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.830 align:start position:0%
might not have as many people coming
forth

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:27.380 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so at this moment
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
because we have since the beginning
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
um well path has been very receptive to
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
increasing the rates that they were very
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
diligent in their initial
 
01:12:39.719 --> 01:12:40.610 align:start position:0%
diligent in their initial
um

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
research to find the competitive rates
 
01:12:46.850 --> 01:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
we're not necessarily seeing that that
 
01:12:51.729 --> 01:12:51.739 align:start position:0%
is the issue and it along the lines of
 
01:12:56.169 --> 01:12:56.179 align:start position:0%
teaching and having people work for us
 
01:12:59.930 --> 01:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
most of our counselors that come and
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
work for us for a few years they're
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
going they go to school while they're
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
with us and finish up their degrees and
 
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
then move on to other positions and
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
that's currently what we're seeing it's
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
the you know that that transition time
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
so they're moving out into other
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
positions and social work or nursing and
 
01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:21.980 align:start position:0%
then we are
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
not getting The Replacements as quickly
 
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you it's very promising
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of weeks we've
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
really broadened the scope and looked at
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
changing up the types of positions and
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
really looking more towards the
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
positions like music therapy and art
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
therapy this as opposed to the counselor
 
01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.770 align:start position:0%
therapy this as opposed to the counselor
nurse

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:45.780 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:46.370 align:start position:0%
nurse
um

01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
previous compliment that we had had
 
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
when we were Hampstead Outlook
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
I would I would sorry I would also add
 
01:13:58.850 --> 01:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
that the success that you see in our
 
01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
nursing increase was a lot due to the
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
conversations that we had with wellpath
 
01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
on how do we make it more competitive
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
and offering bonuses and and aspects
 
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:12.620 align:start position:0%
like that we saw that be very successful
 
01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:15.659 align:start position:0%
and it really targeted we targeted what
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
we needed in particular overnight nurses
 
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
and so we're really starting to
 
01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
strategize on that and and look at the
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
financial component of bringing in more
 
01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.030 align:start position:0%
financial component of bringing in more
counselors

01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and really targeting how we can do
 
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
that financially to to attract to for
 
01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
the positions to be attractive
 
01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:35.209 align:start position:0%
the positions to be attractive
ready

01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:35.219 align:start position:0%
ready
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative Solway may I make a brief
 
01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:41.219 align:start position:0%
comment please you may make a brief
 
01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
comment please
 
01:14:44.209 --> 01:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
um thank you Ms Collins thank you Mr
 
01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
Finnegan um I just want to alert uh the
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and the public
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh to something that I suspect you may
 
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.790 align:start position:0%
uh to something that I suspect you may
know

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
um their
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
um was a member of one of our
 
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
departments I believe it was Parks and
 
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
Recreation who noted that we're New
 
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:07.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're not New York we're not
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
New Jersey we do things differently and
 
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
we take care of one another and the
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
development of Hampstead Hospital by the
 
01:15:17.149 --> 01:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
state is really a very good example of
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
how we try to take care of one another
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily with money on the table
 
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh so a
 
01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:27.659 align:start position:0%
senior level person in Parks and
 
01:15:27.659 --> 01:15:29.209 align:start position:0%
senior level person in Parks and
Recreation

01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
Recreation
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um call down to our urban forestry
 
01:15:34.490 --> 01:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
Center in Portsmouth and you may be
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
aware the state runs this wonderful
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
facility in Portsmouth uh it's run by
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
its director AJ dupare and the person
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
from Parks and Recreation mentioned that
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
they had had a child who had been at
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be nice if the state
 
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
just did something wonderful for these
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
kids so AJ Dupree at the urban forestry
 
01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:00.500 align:start position:0%
Center will be providing plantings
 
01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.110 align:start position:0%
Center will be providing plantings
prunings

01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
prunings
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
walking paths and hiking trails for
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital no cost no obligation
 
01:16:11.149 --> 01:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's New Hampshire it's how we take care
 
01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
of one another it's Thanksgiving we need
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
to be glad that we live here thank you
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
very very much that's amazing
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
I may have written this wrong I want to
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
get it right
 
01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
we were talking about average length of
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
stay of 7 to 10 days but it can be
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
longer and if
 
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
where they should go to next is full did
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
I hear that correctly could you describe
 
01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
what where they go to next is yeah so
 
01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:45.900 align:start position:0%
with the average length of stay I would
 
01:16:47.689 --> 01:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
like to eight
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
extrapolate a little bit on that so that
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
is to our typical average length of
 
01:16:54.169 --> 01:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
state to stabilize a patient is seven to
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
ten days
 
01:16:55.679 --> 01:16:56.770 align:start position:0%
ten days
um

01:16:56.770 --> 01:16:56.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:59.630 --> 01:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
recently we have actually noticed and we
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
tracked this
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
um continually and our average length of
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
stay has increased because of the
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
patients not being able to go to the
 
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facilities or
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
group homes
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
or prtfs which we will then have
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's the next steps
 
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
contributing factor is being able to
 
01:17:29.689 --> 01:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
have in-home supports for some of our
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
patients that don't necessarily meet
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
criteria for residential treatment but
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
they may need an in-home therapist
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
which is provided through external
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
agencies Community Mental Health Centers
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
and their Workforce is also struggling
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
and so we won't send a patient out to
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
the community until they actually have
 
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
those safe resources in place
 
01:17:57.770 --> 01:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
the facility of which I'm
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
a part-time CEO is a training site we
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
get a lot of students coming through and
 
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
often if they're on one of their very
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
early rotations I keep a special eye on
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
them having been a hospital chaplain at
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
one point and trained in counseling I
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
want to see how the students are
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
handling not one but several patients
 
01:18:21.649 --> 01:18:21.659 align:start position:0%
per day some of which may trigger
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
certain things my grandmother died of
 
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
that Etc or or or and how are they
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
coping are they swallowing it are they
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
going in the ladies room and crying
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
because if they don't know how to deal
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's a new day with 12 14 15 more
 
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
people and so on and so on so I'm green
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
on grass especially on our newer
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
students coming through what intentional
 
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
Provisions do you do with new hires
 
01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
especially if they're young in their
 
01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:56.090 align:start position:0%
especially if they're young in their
careers

01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh well path Recovery Solutions they
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
actually have are in the process right
 
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
now of
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
completing a training module and a
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
training program for them currently our
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
an orientation phase if you will and
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're formalizing that to include that
 
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
but historically we have always they
 
01:19:22.669 --> 01:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
have an immediate milieu supervisor then
 
01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:26.060 align:start position:0%
they also have a unit director manager
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
and we have very large Open Door
 
01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
policies at the hospital where they can
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
come and talk and walk through in
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
addition to that we have very
 
01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:41.780 align:start position:0%
formalized processes for any
 
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
incidents that occur anything that's
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
traumatic if you will in the day-to-day
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
because that happens in the day-to-day
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
all the time that there's something that
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
could be of concern so they meet
 
01:19:58.490 --> 01:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
together as a team to process the day in
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
report in the morning and then in the
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon on both ends of their shifts
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
and then there is a formalized process
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to review specifics
 
01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
and debrief on any incident that occurs
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the day that would be
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
I would also say and I I really
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question because I think
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
again this goes back to culture and I
 
01:20:29.570 --> 01:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that we're
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
trying to do and and really our
 
01:20:36.610 --> 01:20:36.620 align:start position:0%
executive team is is really behind is
 
01:20:40.689 --> 01:20:40.699 align:start position:0%
developing that sense of uh
 
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that this job is really
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
difficult in that we want to help grow
 
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
our staff and so we've started providing
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
leadership trainings we've started
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
providing ways in which we can talk to
 
01:20:55.689 --> 01:20:55.699 align:start position:0%
our staff
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
ways in which we can guide our staffs to
 
01:21:02.450 --> 01:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
develop that next level of leadership
 
01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:03.790 align:start position:0%
develop that next level of leadership
opportunities

01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
and again hope that they stay and grow
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
within the role we've provided a group
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
of our team through a presentation a
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
book on change management right how to
 
01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:18.260 align:start position:0%
understand and what work through change
 
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
because as we all know change happens
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
every day and it's something that we're
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
really focused on you know really
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
identifying the temperature of the
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
building at all times seeing where there
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
are some challenges with morale seeing
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
where there are some challenges with
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
um with things that we can help control
 
01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:40.820 align:start position:0%
and then providing that support
 
01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:44.460 align:start position:0%
from the very very top and making sure
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
that everybody knows that we as a group
 
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
we as Hampstead are really care about
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
them and care about not only what
 
01:21:55.729 --> 01:21:55.739 align:start position:0%
they're doing for our patients but but
 
01:21:59.630 --> 01:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
truly about them as individuals and I
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
think we've gotten some pretty good
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
response up to this point uh and I hope
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
that we can continue to see that success
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
I came back from spending quite some
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
time doing debriefing with the New York
 
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
fire department after 9 11. and I came
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
back getting ready to see how my staff
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
was doing and 10 minutes into a
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
conversation with one of my counselors I
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
realized he realized I was showing signs
 
01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
of secondary PTSD and he was debriefing
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
me so it can go up the line too yeah
 
01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:32.219 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%

welcome back thank you hello everyone
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman and members of
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Katrina Hansen
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
I am the chief of infectious disease
 
01:23:27.649 --> 01:23:27.659 align:start position:0%
surveillance within the Bureau of
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
Infectious Disease Control division of
 
01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services and I am here to
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
provide an update on the healthcare
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
associate infections program which is a
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislative creative created program and
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
several reports we have provided this
 
01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
and reported these data to the committee
 
01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
for over 10 years so I will only touch
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
on the data highlights have you given a
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
handout out I haven't what does it look
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
like it would be a letter to the
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
committee and then there are two reports
 
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
right behind it
 
01:23:59.090 --> 01:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
titled Hospital associate infections and
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
yes I I think what representative Solway
 
01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yep uh detailed data are
 
01:24:14.510 --> 01:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
also available online and I did also
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
provide two full copies of the reports
 
01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
as well but they're over 150 pages long
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
so I only brought one copy each I will
 
01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
also provide budget and other program
 
01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.790 align:start position:0%
also provide budget and other program
updates

01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
updates
 
01:24:28.010 --> 01:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of acronyms in
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
various terms I will introduce each one
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
at the first time for clarity but feel
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
free to ask questions after I can also
 
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
clarify and I am also pleased to share
 
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
that the reports in front of you we've
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
released the 13th report on Hospital
 
01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
associate infections and the 10th report
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
on Hospital Healthcare Associated
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
infections and Ambulatory Surgery
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
centers this week and we are planning to
 
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
issue a press release next week
 
01:24:55.370 --> 01:24:55.380 align:start position:0%
Hospital data hospitals are required to
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
report central line Associated
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%

abdominal hysterectomy surgeries
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals are also required to report
 
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Personnel vaccination rates
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
overall New Hampshire reported and
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
observed fewer hais or Healthcare
 
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:22.739 align:start position:0%
Associates infections than predicted
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
based on National Data 157 infections
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
were reported by hospitals in 2021 which
 
01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
is 39.4 fewer than predicted based on
 
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
National Data
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
there were fewer infections observed for

01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
compared to the predicted number of
 
01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
infections and these data are considered
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
lower to National Data abdominal
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy was statistically
 
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than predicted knee

though the numbers were low they were
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
not statistically significant and
 
01:26:06.129 --> 01:26:06.139 align:start position:0%
considered similar to National Data

of the healthy people 2020 goal of 90
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
and a decrease from prior years which
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
really averaged between 90 to 95 percent
 
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
in Ambulatory Surgery centers 10 centers
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%

procedures for 2021 and they also
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
reported zero infections in 2020 if that
 
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
provides some context in 2019 they
 
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.420 align:start position:0%

report that metric
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
some other program updates I'm pleased
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
to share that HEI program is almost

settings such as dialysis or end-stage
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
renal dialysis centers we also will
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
continue to respond effectively and
 
01:30:38.330 --> 01:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
efficiently to outbreaks or other events
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%

01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
assessments that our program conducts
 
01:30:56.570 --> 01:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
work to enhance infectious prevention
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
activities with correction settings that
 
01:31:00.350 --> 01:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
I mentioned previously and expanding
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
that training to include officers in
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%

training to emergency medical personnel
 
01:31:13.129 --> 01:31:13.139 align:start position:0%
including gaps and challenges with drug
 
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
diversion reporting as well as
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
enhancements to retune infection
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
prevention and response and then lastly
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
further engage with our HealthCare
 
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
Partners and hospitals and Ambulatory
 
01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
Surgery centers to increase and improve
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
reporting and the program staff already
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
have a plan and are providing training
 
01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:29.060 align:start position:0%
to provide training to those settings
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
including dialysis to facilitate
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
inclusion of that report or that data in
 
01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
a future report
 
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have for you today
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
pending any questions you mentioned that
 
01:31:42.890 --> 01:31:42.900 align:start position:0%
in terms of the hospitals our numbers
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
are much better than the national
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
average that's correct other than the
 
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
spectacular job that the hospital
 
01:31:53.890 --> 01:31:53.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
why would you think that is
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
I think there's many factors
 
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of quality efforts that
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
are being underway at various Healthcare
 
01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
facilities the measures we track we've
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
been tracking for over 10 years and we
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
have seen improvement over time and we
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
do see that overall as a whole New
 
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has had fewer infections
 
01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
reported than National Data however if
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
you look at it year by year our number
 
01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
there is variability in the number of
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
infections that are reported and so
 
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
there are still things that we can do
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
and work with facilities to improve
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
infections going forward my overall goal
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
is zero or as few infections as possible
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of mechanisms in place to
 
01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
prevent infections such as surgical
 
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
checklists antimicrobial prophylaxis
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
tracking various other practice measures
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
that have Healthcare facilities have put
 
01:32:50.810 --> 01:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
in place I also know that the infection
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
prevention-ness and other individuals at
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
Healthcare facilities work very hard and
 
01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
diligently every day to not only report
 
01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
these data but also to ensure that those
 
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
Healthcare facilities know those
 
01:33:03.910 --> 01:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
practices any other questions
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you um I was
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
um only because I've heard of a recent
 
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
hospital that showed an increase uh in C
 
01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:14.470 align:start position:0%
hospital that showed an increase uh in C
diff

01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
diff
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
do you monitor that or track it at all
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh and I patients can come into the
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
hospital with it but they certainly can
 
01:33:23.629 --> 01:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
acquire it when the hospital so I was
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
just wondering if in any way you take a
 
01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
look at those numbers thank you
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy that's a great
 
01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.390 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy that's a great
question

01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
um so C diff or clostridium difficile
 
01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
infection or CDI we also call it is not
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
a reportable condition under our statue
 
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
RSA 151 nor is it a loan under 141c
 
01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
which is the general public health
 
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
reporting for reportable conditions
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
however if there was a cluster outbreak
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
or unusual occurrence of disease we
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
would get alerted to that in 2021 I
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe there was any reported
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
cluster of C diff we also do track we do
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
track or provide resources around
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
clusterium difficile during these
 
01:34:03.050 --> 01:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
infection control assessments and we do
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
have a special component of that
 
01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
assessment that does discuss C diff
 
01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
particularly around the use of antimic
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
or alcohol-based hand sanitizer in
 
01:34:15.890 --> 01:34:15.900 align:start position:0%
ensuring that providers are also using
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate precautions and also washing
 
01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
their hands since C difficile is a
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
really resistant organism But to answer
 
01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
your question short no we do not track C
 
01:34:28.450 --> 01:34:28.460 align:start position:0%
difficile good thank you
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Guida thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:34:34.370 --> 01:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
excellent report some questions how many
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
fatalities do we have in the state in
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
the reporting period that is a really
 
01:34:40.850 --> 01:34:40.860 align:start position:0%
good question and unfortunately I cannot
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
provide you the answer because we do not
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
track mortality associated with these
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
infections and how they are reported
 
01:34:47.890 --> 01:34:47.900 align:start position:0%
into the system
 
01:34:50.209 --> 01:34:50.219 align:start position:0%
the system we use called National
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Safety Network only shows the
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
number of infections it doesn't show the
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
mortality associated with it though
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
certain infections do have higher
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
mortality associated with them
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
in particularly central line Associated
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
bloodstream infections and certain
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
surgical site infections may have higher
 
01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:09.659 align:start position:0%
mortality associated with them so those
 
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
um those those infections are ones that
 
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
we really do track closely to try to
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
reduce those infections to the best of
 
01:35:17.930 --> 01:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
our ability so to paraphrase you're not
 
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
tracking fatalities that is correct we
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
are not tracking fatalities you track
 
01:35:22.199 --> 01:35:24.110 align:start position:0%
are not tracking fatalities you track
re-hospitalizations

01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
re-hospitalizations
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
and no we do not track hospitalization
 
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
or re-hospitalizations to your knowledge
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
how many states do on both
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think I have that answer in
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
front of me I'll have to bring that back
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
and come back to you I for at least the
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
tool that we use many states use the
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
same tool it's a national based system
 
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
there isn't a mechanism in there that
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
can really get down to that nuanced
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
level of morbidity or re or
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
re-hospitalizations or mortality
 
01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:54.300 align:start position:0%
associated with those infections thank
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr I would significantly hope that
 
01:35:59.689 --> 01:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
someone proposes legislation because my
 
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:01.860 align:start position:0%
constituents are not interested in
 
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
percentages but there are when I push
 
01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
the legislation that was brought in by a
 
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
new representative 20 years ago 99 New
 
01:36:11.689 --> 01:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens died from hospital
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
acquired inspections that's data we need
 
01:36:16.129 --> 01:36:16.139 align:start position:0%
to keep it's not your fault that we're
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
not it's our fault that we haven't made
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
that metric a requirement and so I would
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
certainly ask that somebody on the
 
01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:23.219 align:start position:0%
stable would you shoot me an email over
 
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
the weekend please sure to that effect
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
and as much as you can and write the
 
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
lsr2 for me while you're up wait a
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
minute I'm retiring no you're not
 
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for any other questions
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
well representative Solway a comment Mr
 
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
chairman uh really for you and I would
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
invite Miss Henson to respond
 
01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:47.629 align:start position:0%
invite Miss Henson to respond
um

01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
we are a small state
 
01:36:53.990 --> 01:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we have one academic Medical Center
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:36:59.570 --> 01:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
we are adjacent to probably the world's
 
01:37:02.290 --> 01:37:02.300 align:start position:0%
greatest agglomeration of medical
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
expertise in the world in the city of
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
Boston and as a result of that
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
when we here in New Hampshire uh
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
encounter vulnerable patients when we
 
01:37:20.689 --> 01:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
get hit by a resistant infection it is
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
not unlikely that we ship them to Boston
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
so at the risk of uh tearing a rotator
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
cuff patting ourselves on the back
 
01:37:36.770 --> 01:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
we probably not become terribly
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable with our data compared to
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
other states some of that is an artifact
 
01:37:47.090 --> 01:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's a good
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
comment we do struggle with this um
 
01:37:50.649 --> 01:37:50.659 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:52.739 align:start position:0%
patients travel across border for
 
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
healthcare I think is what you're
 
01:37:55.850 --> 01:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
referencing alluding to and then also
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
antimicrobial resistant infections can
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
then also then spread or really be
 
01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.590 align:start position:0%
then also then spread or really be
undetected

01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
undetected
 
01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:02.219 align:start position:0%
I do want to mention that our program
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
works diligently when we do identify an
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
antimicrobial resistant infection that
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
is within our reportable condition law
 
01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
we work closely to try to identify the
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
path of that patient and then where the
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
various Healthcare touch points were to
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that if let's say that a patient
 
01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
was in Massachusetts or in a Vermont
 
01:38:23.530 --> 01:38:23.540 align:start position:0%
facility or main facility we will
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
contact the health department in that
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
location and try to ensure that if
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
patients were or Healthcare Providers
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
may have been exposed that those
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
individuals are appropriately notified
 
01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson did you have a
 
01:38:43.490 --> 01:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
question no okay just waving okay hi
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else thank you so much for your
 
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
next up tuition waiver for children and
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
State foster care or guardianship
 
01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
attorney Beth mudgeson and
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
knees so you have a rule in your
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
division for bets like DHHS does with
 
01:39:12.110 --> 01:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
Laurie's is that correct that's correct
 
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you yes so yes my name is legally
 
01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth me but you can refer to me as
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
Beth I'd work for that I didn't mean any
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
disrespect but that's what it is in the
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.169 --> 01:39:30.179 align:start position:0%
um before we begin I'd like to thank you
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
all for performing the roles that you do
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the citizens of New
 
01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I applaud the time and effort
 
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
you put into the governess of the
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
Granite State
 
01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
and have voted personally I have voted
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
in every election that I've been
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
entitled to do so so I'm in awe of what
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.649 --> 01:39:57.659 align:start position:0%
um going back to me personally I was the
 
01:39:57.659 --> 01:39:58.610 align:start position:0%
um going back to me personally I was the
first

01:39:58.610 --> 01:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
person in my family
 
01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
to be awarded a Bachelor of Science in
 
01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:05.390 align:start position:0%
to be awarded a Bachelor of Science in
education

01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:40:07.810 --> 01:40:07.820 align:start position:0%
many moons ago
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
back then
 
01:40:11.890 --> 01:40:11.900 align:start position:0%
College was
 
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
reasonably affordable to working class
 
01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:18.380 align:start position:0%
middle class Americans
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
now my entire tuition when I attended
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
Wheelock College is one year at
 
01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.530 align:start position:0%
Wheelock College is one year at
unh

01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to put that a little
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
bit on your radar
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
my position with DHHS dcyf is in
 
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the Adolescent program
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
as youth engagement specialist
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
I work with the tuition waiver program I
 
01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:53.830 align:start position:0%
I work with the tuition waiver program I
also

01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
facilitate the youth Advisory Board and
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
I track the United data which is
 
01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
National Youth and transition
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I enjoy it immensely
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
and one of my favorite things is
 
01:41:14.450 --> 01:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
engaging with these youth that have
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
applied for the tuition waiver
 
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's part of my job
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to engage with those
 
01:41:22.980 --> 01:41:24.290 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to engage with those
youth

01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
youth
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
it involves calls texts emails and
 
01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:31.139 align:start position:0%
fortunately my adult children have also
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
taught me how to FaceTime quite well so
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
I use whatever venue I can to reach out
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
to these youth
 
01:41:39.659 --> 01:41:40.490 align:start position:0%
to these youth
um

01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:46.010 --> 01:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
and I also try to empower them and
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
include them in any correspondence or
 
01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:51.229 align:start position:0%
include them in any correspondence or
conversation

01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:41:56.590 --> 01:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
in addition to their foster parent or
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
adoptive parents
 
01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.430 align:start position:0%
adoptive parents
um

01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.290 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:42:03.290 --> 01:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
there were 49 certified applicants for
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
the tuition waiver program this year
 
01:42:14.810 --> 01:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
by comparison there were 48 applicants
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
in 2021 and 46 in 2020. so we've seen a
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
rise in students that would like the
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
but there aren't enough to go around at
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
the time you know right now so we have
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
to wait list youth
 
01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:37.070 align:start position:0%
to wait list youth
uh

01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.129 --> 01:42:45.139 align:start position:0%
um we're looking to expand eligibility
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
to the ages of 23 to 26 because not all
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
kids are ready to go on to college at
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
18. so we'd like to widen that a little
 
01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:00.729 align:start position:0%
18. so we'd like to widen that a little
bit

01:43:00.729 --> 01:43:00.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
we are also looking to expand the
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
criteria for eligibility to include
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
youths at Exit dcyf care through a
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
permanency plan of legal guardianship to
 
01:43:16.970 --> 01:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
a relative or other adult
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
we're also looking to increase the
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
amount of waivers from both the
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
community college and university of New
 
01:43:28.490 --> 01:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire systems
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
and we're also looking to expand
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria to include youth
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
placed with grandparents or other
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:43.629 --> 01:43:43.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
re-read for you the data included in the
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:52.450 --> 01:43:52.460 align:start position:0%
um but I will
 
01:43:55.390 --> 01:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%

who is a first year student at nhti
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
and things like this make me feel like
 
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
this program is a worthy one and when
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
you have a young adult working on a
 
01:44:18.609 --> 01:44:18.619 align:start position:0%
viable career
 
01:44:18.619 --> 01:44:20.350 align:start position:0%

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.119 --> 01:44:43.550 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned foster
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
parents and somewhere I thought you said
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
adoptive parents is that adoptive
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
parents of a foster child or
 
01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.139 align:start position:0%
adoptive parents for a child who's been
 
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
in care it been in the system like
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
Michaela was adopted by
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
Stephanie stillings and they gave
 
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:21.780 align:start position:0%

thank you I have two adopted children
 
01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
that are grown now so under the system
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
theoretically they could have gotten
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
free tuition
 
01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
tuition assistance yes and under the
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
circumstances I think yep and and the um
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
criteria are on the application would
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%

regarding the use of restraints
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
and the use of different modes of
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%

the report you should have in front of
 
01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:11.219 align:start position:0%
you which contains summary statistics
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
from year three which we're calling
 
01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
which is October of 2021 through
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
September of 2022 and since we now have
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
three years of data under our belt we
 
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
have some trending statistics to share
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%

01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
see there are 1271 ieas in this 12-month
 
01:48:34.550 --> 01:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
period that's an average of 106

transports per month
 
01:48:41.090 --> 01:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
vast majority of these 99 were adults
 
01:48:44.689 --> 01:48:44.699 align:start position:0%
um 37 of transports happened by
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
ambulance 62 by law enforcement and the
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
rest were by other means
 
01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
when it came to the use of restraints it
 
01:48:55.609 --> 01:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
was pretty split there was 46 percent
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
occurred without restraints 53 with and
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
we did have a handful of unknowns
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
and for the transfers that use
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
restraints it was pretty split between
 
01:49:09.229 --> 01:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
the use of combination handcuffs only
 
01:49:13.490 --> 01:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
and um waist belt only
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
if you turn to the next page
 
01:49:20.209 --> 01:49:20.219 align:start position:0%
the table at the top takes that 1271
 
01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:23.219 align:start position:0%
number and it breaks it down by month as
 
01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
well as the DRM facility that received
 
01:49:27.649 --> 01:49:27.659 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
just to give you a sense of volumes New
 
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital did take a majority
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
63 percent and the rest were divided
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
among the other six
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
the next few sections have some more
 
01:49:43.310 --> 01:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
detail on these metrics and these are
 
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
for adult transports only
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
so first is the mode of transportation
 
01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:50.149 align:start position:0%
so first is the mode of transportation
summary

01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
summary
 
01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
for adults 62 percent uh through the
 
01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:56.219 align:start position:0%
year were transported by law enforcement
 
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
and as you can see from the bar chart
 
01:50:01.370 --> 01:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
this didn't fluctuate too much over the
 
01:50:06.890 --> 01:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
year I ranged between 57 and 66 so not
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
too much variation on the division of
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
the Moto transportation
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
on the following page there's a
 
01:50:18.290 --> 01:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the restraint application
 
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
and this is divided up by the mode of
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
transportation as well
 
01:50:26.209 --> 01:50:26.219 align:start position:0%
on the left you see the ambulance counts
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
there were only four ambulance
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
transports in through the whole year
 
01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
that used a restraint law enforcement
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
was much higher 84 percent total of law
 
01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement transports did use
 
01:50:42.010 --> 01:50:42.020 align:start position:0%
restraints for adults and other
 
01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
transports is in the third column
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
um of I believe all of the other
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
transports that used restraints do refer
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
to staff at the prison moving their
 
01:50:59.350 --> 01:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
inmates to a facility
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
been on page four
 
01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
you see the breakdown of adult restraint
 
01:51:07.729 --> 01:51:07.739 align:start position:0%
type used by law enforcement
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
you can see there is no one method that
 
01:51:14.090 --> 01:51:14.100 align:start position:0%
was highly preferred again pretty evenly
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
split between combination handcuffs and
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
waist belt with a few leg restraint only
 
01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
and at the bottom of page four we see
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
the summary for the child transport and
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
restraints there are only 15 child ieas
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
through the entire 12-month period seven
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
were taken by law enforcement eight by
 
01:51:37.850 --> 01:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
ambulance and that was basically how the
 
01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:38.750 align:start position:0%
ambulance and that was basically how the
um

01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:41.810 --> 01:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
the restraint was split as well all
 
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
seven law enforcement and one ambulance
 
01:51:47.689 --> 01:51:47.699 align:start position:0%
uh transports used a combination
 
01:51:50.689 --> 01:51:50.699 align:start position:0%
restraint all applied before the child
 
01:51:54.050 --> 01:51:54.060 align:start position:0%
left the sending facility
 
01:51:56.570 --> 01:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
so those are the summary of year three
 
01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
on the next page we see the trending
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
information and I do have a few
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
highlighted to bring to your attention
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
first is the average transports per
 
01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
month between year one and year three we
 
01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
see a drop from 138 to 106. and this is
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
complemented by the chart at the bottom
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
which is the drf transports five report
 
01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
year which shows you the volume
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
um by drf and how that has changed and
 
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
you can see in year three that across
 
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
the board accepting Hampstead Hospital
 
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
all the drfs did see a decrease in the
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
number of patients they've received we
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
do want to make a point and miss the
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
point we'll speak more to this but we
 
01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that this is mostly due
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
to the reduction in the capacity at the
 
01:52:52.729 --> 01:52:52.739 align:start position:0%
drfs this is not a reduction in the need
 
01:52:56.209 --> 01:52:56.219 align:start position:0%
or demand for services in this state
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
we also see a sharp drop in the number
 
01:53:02.090 --> 01:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
of children in year three going from 78
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
to 15. this is related to New Hampshire
 
01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
hospital no longer receiving children
 
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
ieas and again this Lapointe can speak
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
more to that point
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
we do see an increase in the use of
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
restraints so restraints overall Rose
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
about nine percent between year one and
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
year three up to from 44 to 53 and I did
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
highlight the law enforcement using
 
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
restraints which jumped about 11 between
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
year one and year two and then remained
 
01:53:39.649 --> 01:53:39.659 align:start position:0%
almost exactly the same in year three at
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
84 percent
 
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
and then the final page of the reports
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
has some trending line graphs the top
 
01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
chart showing the number of total ieas
 
01:53:52.609 --> 01:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
per month and you can see that downward
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
Trend as we spoke about and then the
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
bottom shows the percentage of
 
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
restraints used in transport
 
01:54:04.609 --> 01:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
um yes and no and you can see how that
 
01:54:07.250 --> 01:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
fluctuates over the three-year period
 
01:54:10.129 --> 01:54:10.139 align:start position:0%
and the pages beyond that are an
 
01:54:13.129 --> 01:54:13.139 align:start position:0%
appendix that provide more detail of the
 
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:15.780 align:start position:0%
numbers that went into these statistics
 
01:54:18.590 --> 01:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you and let me know if you have
 
01:54:20.209 --> 01:54:20.219 align:start position:0%
any questions on the data or questions
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
from what's the point
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
I have two questions number one in the
 
01:54:28.129 --> 01:54:28.139 align:start position:0%
chart on the bottom of page six it may
 
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
not be longitudinal enough to ask why
 
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
the red is going up and the blue is
 
01:54:37.550 --> 01:54:37.560 align:start position:0%
going down it may not be significant for
 
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.649 --> 01:54:45.659 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Pearson
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson I was actually
 
01:54:51.890 --> 01:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
um struck by by that as well and
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
I think an important point to make is
 
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
that obviously the the determination of
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
utilizing restraints for for
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
transportation is made by the sending
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
facility the sending Hospital obviously
 
01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
also in conjunction with the
 
01:55:08.209 --> 01:55:08.219 align:start position:0%
transportation that's being provided
 
01:55:09.649 --> 01:55:09.659 align:start position:0%
whether it be ambulance or law
 
01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I don't want to speculate
 
01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
on their rationale behind decision
 
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
making but one of the things that struck
 
01:55:20.390 --> 01:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
me is the timing of this change in the
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
midst of covid I think covid obviously
 
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
can sway some of these percentages and
 
01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
um I I was wondering if it had to do
 
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
with an increase in infection
 
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
preventions and safety precautions as it
 
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
related to working with these patients
 
01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
via Transportation but that was a
 
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
speculation on my part I think you're
 
01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
right I don't think that there's enough
 
01:55:45.649 --> 01:55:45.659 align:start position:0%
data yet to make a solid determination
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
my second question is where are you
 
01:55:48.830 --> 01:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
native to
 
01:55:52.729 --> 01:55:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Cleveland Ohio
 
01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
see if I was to talk about Leos it would
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
be law enforcement but you spoke so well
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
I said this one this excuse me you must
 
01:56:05.209 --> 01:56:05.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions Senator garden thank
 
01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:56:11.450 --> 01:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
so when we look at law enforcement and
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
chief you might be able to help us out
 
01:56:12.840 --> 01:56:13.609 align:start position:0%
chief you might be able to help us out
here

01:56:13.609 --> 01:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:56:17.870 --> 01:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
are those restraints a result of policy
 
01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
in the department or are these just
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
reflective of
 
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh restraints that needed to be applied
 
01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
because of Behavioral aberrations by the
 
01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:28.729 align:start position:0%
because of Behavioral aberrations by the
patients

01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:56:30.050 --> 01:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and I would
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
definitely welcome the chief to join us

when the decisions are made to utilize
 
01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:41.100 align:start position:0%
restraints it's due to the circumstance
 
01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
or the assessment of the patient at the
 
01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:45.540 align:start position:0%

01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation because either can't
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
afford it or they're in such a medical
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%

01:58:48.050 --> 01:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
exams to become a high school baseball
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
umpire because I love I love baseball
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.410 --> 01:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
out that the only time
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
an organist and you know I'm a classical
 
01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
day trained organist was ever thrown out
 
01:59:05.629 --> 01:59:05.639 align:start position:0%
of a baseball game was when the it was a
 
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
triple A there were three umpires and
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
they were not calling it right in the
 
01:59:13.729 --> 01:59:13.739 align:start position:0%
mind of the hometown organist so when
 
01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
the organists made yet the latest
 
01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
mistake he broke into a rendition of
 
01:59:22.129 --> 01:59:22.139 align:start position:0%
three blind mice at which point he was
 
01:59:24.169 --> 01:59:24.179 align:start position:0%
run the only time in the history of
 
01:59:26.450 --> 01:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
baseball an organist was ever run by an
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
Umpire just remember that
 
01:59:38.810 --> 01:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:45.669 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.679 --> 01:59:47.709 align:start position:0%
 
hi

01:59:47.709 --> 01:59:47.719 align:start position:0%
hi
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
well it's just
 
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be challenged but
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
maybe oh well let's fix this but it
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't say who's appointing it just
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have a physician appointed
 
01:59:58.199 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have a physician appointed
by
