committee Services um and they're going

to help us make sure that you can submit
 
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 align:start position:0%
testimony online on the online
 
00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
submission form right now you have to
 
00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
put in a bill number so the the form
 
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
isn't working working for on our
 
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
committee web page so we're going to
 
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
work on fixing that and um that being
 
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
said if you have documents that contain
 
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 align:start position:0%
sensitive information um you're expected
 
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
to self- redact any information that you
 
00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
might have court orders not to share or
 
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
um you know personal information that
 
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want to become part of the
 
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.430 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want to become part of the
public

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
record our topic of today is due process
 
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
where did it come from what is it when
 
00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
is it required are the different kinds
 
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh what are the essential essential
 
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
elements of it so I see we have a number
 
00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
of guests here who may inform us of
 
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
their understanding of due process and
 
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee also have their
 
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
expertise uh to share on that and
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
um perhaps there are some stories from
 
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
people in the audience about their
 
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
experiences with due process as it
 
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
DCF and uh then afterward the committee
 
00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
will have an opportunity for
 
00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
discussion our committee researcher was
 
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
kind of enough to provide us with um
 
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.550 align:start position:0%
kind of enough to provide us with um
some

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 align:start position:0%
documents and uh so there were a lot of
 
00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
them and that would have been a lot of
 
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
paper so if there's anything that you
 
00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
all want printed for us to have here for
 
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
our discussion after specifically um we
 
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
can let Christina know if you want to
 
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
um we can just ask her and then we can
 
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.670 align:start position:0%
 
printed

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
okay so think I will
 
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
start with calling the first
 
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
sorry so I think I'll go ahead and call
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
peruse Madam chair any point of order
 
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
yes um pursuant to RSA
 
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
1414 which states any Senator or
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative while acting as a member
 
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
of a committee of the
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
legislature May administer an oath to
 
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
any person who may be examined before
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
such committee I would like to require
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
an oath of the witness and all Witnesses
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
testifying before this committee the
 
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
testimony we are taking is concerning
 
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
very serious subject matter and we must
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
ensure truthfulness they have been
 
00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 align:start position:0%
various committees both ad hoc and
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
standing which Have Heard lots of
 
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
testimony relative to family law matters
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
and in many cases can go on and on and
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
take up lots of precious time and
 
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was later found out that
 
00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 align:start position:0%
testimony was INF factual what we want
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
want to do is establish that this
 
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
process is eliciting factual information
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
so we can make the most informed
 
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
receive um well I've looked up that that
 
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
RSA myself um and it is our I I'll allow
 
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
it the point taken it I think it's very
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
prudent representative Weber did you
 
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 align:start position:0%
have a point of order yes um it's it's
 
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
something that we normally do not do
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
and this is not a tribunal this is a
 
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
fact finding Mission and uh it's seems
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
to me that to require an oath um is way
 
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
outside of our normal um
 
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.469 align:start position:0%
outside of our normal um
procedure

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
and as one who assumes people standing
 
00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
in front of us are going to be truthful
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
um uh I think it's I think it's frankly
 
00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
kind of insulting to our Witnesses but I
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
also uh the point of this commission
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
committee is to discover issues with
 
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
DCF it is not to prepare the ground for
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
some kind of future
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
prosecution and so I think that the
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
um both unnecessary and insulting and I
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
would um
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
really prefer to get a ruling from the
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
speaker's office as to whether it's an
 
00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing for us to be doing
 
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
because I've literally in 18 years never
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
seen it okay um I appreciate your
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh I I'm going to go forward
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
and permit the oath to be performed upon
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
the witness uh I'm going to object until
 
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
we have a go from the speaker's office
 
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.629 align:start position:0%
we have a go from the speaker's office
you

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
take actually I can comment yep go ahead
 
00:07:00.869 --> 00:07:00.879 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh so a lot of people that testify in my
 
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.629 align:start position:0%
uh so a lot of people that testify in my
experience

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
um I run the perception that they were
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
wrong um there are often times when uh
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
their perception was
 
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
changed uh and they didn't go through
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
the right people uh the fact that people
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
are showing up here taking their time
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
out of their day to show up here I trust
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
um I do p onion to see where something
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
is may not be the reality but it's their
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
reality and I absolutely agree that it's
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
their reality uh so to put them under
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
oath I think would um you know would
 
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 align:start position:0%
harm that um okay because it you know if
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
we find out later that it wasn't the
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
fact but it's their perception and their
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
fact that may be problematic so um
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
before I hear your thoughts
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
representative I'm going to share my own
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
um I I think that it's good form to
 
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
expect truthfulness in our um
 
00:08:09.869 --> 00:08:09.879 align:start position:0%
testimonies that we receive here and we
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
can't make any decisions if we're
 
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:13.879 align:start position:0%
receiving any information that is um
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
frivolous unnecessary or untruthful of
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
course um the uh you can't you
 
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
can't you can't verify that the
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
information that you're receiving is
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
truthful without an oath so this is such
 
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
a serious matter and I I understand it
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done but we do have the The
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
Authority in the statute in chapter one
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
of our state statutes that's something
 
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:43.399 align:start position:0%
that we have the right to
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
exercise um you know in our duties to
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
serve the people um so we don't have any
 
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
house rules against it and um I I think
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's very important that it's applied I
 
00:08:59.230 --> 00:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
think it should be applied evenly and I
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
I would like to see it in all committee
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
hearings in the house um and I thank the
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative for for bringing that up
 
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I uh I'm I would like to to allow
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
these Witnesses or or i' would like to
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
ensure that all Witnesses in this
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
committee are under
 
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
oath go ahead I'd like to second that
 
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
motion uh because RSA 1414 States any
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
Senator or representative while acting
 
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
as a member of the committee of the
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
legisl May administer a note it's
 
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
already in the RSA I don't think we need
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
to go any further by checking with the
 
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
me so the clerk has ruled that we can
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
administer an oath you are not required
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
to take it um but we can we can ask that
 
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.710 align:start position:0%
to take it um but we can we can ask that
you

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
do go ahead thank you madam chairwoman
 
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know my the committee that um
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative long and I serve on has
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
the same in representative Panic we have
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
the same um you know level I think all
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
committees have the same level of of
 
00:10:13.389 --> 00:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
importance I think one of the hardest
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
things for getting people to testify and
 
00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:17.959 align:start position:0%
come testify is the great amount of
 
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
pressure that we have particularly even
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
abuse victims we're going to deal with
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
people here that have abuse and there's
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
gaslighting what their truth is we
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
really should just be open to hearing
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
it's up to us to discern what we take
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
from that particular testimony but I
 
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
actually think it will limit free the
 
00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:37.519 align:start position:0%
freedom to talk and testimony I think
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's an unnecessary and I do think that
 
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.990 align:start position:0%
it's an unnecessary and I do think that
it's

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
um insulting to do that so I I do not
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
think that we should go that
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
Weber I think the last thing that I
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
would say on the subject is that first
 
00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:00.279 align:start position:0%
off um we all hope and expect that the
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
truth will be stated here people who are
 
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
not truthful are not necessarily going
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
to be deterred by an oath except to the
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
extent that they might be prosecuted
 
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.949 align:start position:0%
extent that they might be prosecuted
afterwards

00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
and I just think that with the gravity
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the emotionalism that comes with
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
these most deeply personal
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings um as as others have said um
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
one's emotions are in Tangled and I
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
think it's very unwise but I can also
 
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
count votes so um thank you for letting
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
that representative long thank you madam
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
chair uh will representatives and
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
Senators be taking olds also if they're
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
testifying anyone who is testifying I I
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
should I should expect I think that it
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
should be applied evenly to anyone
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
before the committee and we have already
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
had one person testify without taking a
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
oath correct yeah so it's beginning now
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
every witness will uh will have an oath
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
sworn all right sir would you
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Panic would you um
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
perform the oath on the witness do you
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
have I can do it all right sir if you
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
would stand and raise your right
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
hand do you swear that the testimony
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
that you are about to provide is the
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
truth the whole truth and nothing but
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
the truth yes I do thank
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
you does it not have to be
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
either under God or but under the pains
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
and penalties of perjury if they're
 
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
swearing an oath from what I have read
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh there's no particular form as long as
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's understood that it's an oath and
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
that the one that I just gave is almost
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
word for word the one that's given in
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%

thank you for allowing me to share my
 
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.110 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to share my
testimony

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
today a little bit of background on
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
myself in 2014 I was divorced uh three
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
kids at the time and in in the process
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
of that divorce proceeding I was
 
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
homeless and so at the time I agreed to
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
a parenting plan that allowed me that
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
allowed her to have custody of the the
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
kids where I get uh parenting time as
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
agreed by both
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
parties and that worked well for a while
 
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
until it was untenable um the other
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
party would not work with me as well as
 
00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
I was hoping and so
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
in May of 2023 I filed a motion in court
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh to try and get that amended after
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
getting back on my feet um I worked
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
through getting a part and now I'm a
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%
homeowner and so I'm I'm in a much
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
better position now to be able to be a
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
parent for my
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
children um so
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
in I have to double check May 3rd of
 
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
2023 I filed a motion in court towards
 
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.110 align:start position:0%
2023 I filed a motion in court towards
that

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.749 align:start position:0%
that
end

00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
and on the 5th the other party was
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
served by the
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
sheriff and on the 8th a complaint was
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
filed with
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.470 align:start position:0%
filed with
DCF

00:14:59.470 --> 00:14:59.480 align:start position:0%

00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%

claimed a safety plan was issued at that
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
hands on and non-negotiable using any
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
form of physical discipline with the
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
child or any of the
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
children uh that was the first safety
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
plan regarding one child and without my
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge or permission that was uh the
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
other children were
 
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.790 align:start position:0%
other children were
added

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
um and I was I was working with an
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
attorney when we had filed the petition
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
in court so my attorney was working with
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
me and giving me some advice on this as
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
well it was reasonable to agree to it at
 
00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:34.509 align:start position:0%
well it was reasonable to agree to it at
the

00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:36.350 align:start position:0%
the
time

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
and um I was
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
informed when I was first called by the
 
00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:43.829 align:start position:0%
informed when I was first called by the
dcyf

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
cpsw it was apparent that she did not
 
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.470 align:start position:0%
cpsw it was apparent that she did not
like

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.309 align:start position:0%
like
me

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:52.230 align:start position:0%
me
um

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
it it came across very easily to
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
understand that she believed I was
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
guilty of
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
what they were
 
00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
claiming and that was from the from the
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
outset 10 days after the case was opened
 
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.470 align:start position:0%
outset 10 days after the case was opened
with

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
DCF and when I was first
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
notified and I was informed that at that
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
time on that phone call that I would
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
have a home visit soon as soon as I had
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
talked to the
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
detective regarding the case in a
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
criminal matter though same same claimed
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
incident I had to talk to the detective
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
claim and then it continued where I was
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get the home visit and it was
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
delayed and delayed and delayed um to
 
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
the point
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
where I was
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
told in uh let's see here as I mentioned
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
to you on the phone our visit
 
00:17:59.230 --> 00:17:59.240 align:start position:0%
appointments have been tentative on the
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
investigation process due to the
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
investigation still pending with the
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
detective will need to reschedule
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's visit until the detective is
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
complete which was different than what
 
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
I'd been told on the
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
phone so her claim was that the
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
detective's office had to complete their
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
investigation before they would even
 
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
me and then uh further
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh safety plans were enacted and it was
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
all verbal on my part uh where she would
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
call me and I would verbally agree to
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
the safety plan um and the second one
 
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
began with all the children were
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
included where they uh would not where
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
they would stay with their mother um but
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
there was no notification that I could
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
not have any contact with any of them uh
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
the mother
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
P the mother restricted my
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
contact to the point where I
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
had no contact at all for a month and a
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
children um and after this went on for a
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
while on June 13th I sent an email
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
stating that I revoked my agreement to
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
the safety plan that res restricts my
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
contact and parenting time with the
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
children I still had not yet had the
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
home visit on June
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.830 align:start position:0%
home visit on June
13th

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
and at that time I was H the response on
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
the same day was that they would have
 
00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.159 --> 00:19:44.590 align:start position:0%
 
mine

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:47.549 --> 00:19:47.559 align:start position:0%
and at that time we had informed them
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
that there were witnesses to the time
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
period where they claimed that an
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
incident happened and at that moment
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
still June nobody had talked to any of
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
those Witnesses the home visit had not
 
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.230 align:start position:0%
those Witnesses the home visit had not
been

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
completed um I had requested records
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
requests uh through DCF trying to get
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
records showing anything that I could so
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
that I could understand what even the
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
allegations were against
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
me uh the cpsw did not notate any of
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
that to
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
me and then
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
on June
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
22nd on my my behalf uh my attorney sent
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
an a
 
00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
letter stating that I had not seen spent
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
any time with or had any sort of contact
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
with my children in over a month and a
 
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.990 align:start position:0%
with my children in over a month and a
half

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
um despite my recent rejection of the
 
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.039 align:start position:0%
safety plan the children's mother has
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
taken the position that the safety plan
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
remains in effect and stands for the
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
proposition that I must have absolutely
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
no contact with the
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
children at that time he had spoken with
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and he stated that the
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
detective had told us from the uh police
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
office investigating that they did not
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
advise DCF of any position against
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
parent or child contact they further
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
stated that they communicated to DCF
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
that it does not need to wait for for
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
the police department to further its own
 
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
investigation DCF had full permission to
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
do the home
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
visit um and yet they were still not
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
sorry um then we received a response on
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
July 3 my attorney sent the the letter
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
on June 22nd we got a response on July
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
3D I still had not had any time with the
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
kids um that they
 
00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.029 align:start position:0%
kids um that they
understood

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:58.630 align:start position:0%
understood
that

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
I no longer agree to the safety plan
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary safety plan it's no
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
longer in effect they agreed to that at
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
that time they had asked the mother to
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
be protective of the
 
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.070 align:start position:0%
be protective of the
children

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:35.390 align:start position:0%
that and the timeline from there becomes
interesting

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%

I have this right it came across that
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
she believed I was guilty correct can so
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's a subjective um Absol judgment
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
being here today and sharing your story
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
which I can't imagine could be easy in
 
00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:07.720 align:start position:0%
any way uh I you alluded to this but I
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify and be sure I have
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
this correct um there
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
was the criminal prosecution was
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
discontinued is that correct yes ma'am
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
it is and then there was no judicial
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
proceeding uh with respect to the abuse
 
00:32:30.029 --> 00:32:30.039 align:start position:0%
and neglect complaint is that correct
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
that is correct so you never went to
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
court on that that is correct and then
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
your name was placed in a registry that
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
is correct and you didn't have any
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
chance to challenge that before it
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
happened before it happened no it is no
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
I did not have that opportunity okay was
 
00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
was there an opportunity after it
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
happened the opportunity um along with
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
the letter of finding they did tell me
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
that I could appeal it okay uh however
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
with the proceedings going on with
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
family court and trying to gain some
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%

allowing me the opportunity to speak
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
today I am Katrina
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
Heinrich today I'm going to speak to you
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
from a place of experience little bit of
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
research background and organizational
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
compliance and financial industry for
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
me and while the education and
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
professional experiences has allowed me
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
to better understand the function and
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
issues of Family Court due process the
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
associated agencies there's nothing as
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
insightful as being in the New Hampshire
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
family court system for over a
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
decade this is my experience and my
 
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
conclusions DCF was involved very
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
quickly in my case and very quickly fell
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
off while they came to visit they
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
decided that there was no help they
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
could possibly offer Us in the abuse
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
occurring I asked for resources none was
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
given you have to talk to the police you
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
have to do this no matter what Avenues I
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
took nothing was helping
 
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
me I felt as if dcyf was kind of putting
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
up a wall and they were so disinterested
 
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:39.079 align:start position:0%
kids with that
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
said in a post- divorce
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
scenario I found myself in family court
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
for no stated
 
00:40:51.069 --> 00:40:51.079 align:start position:0%
reasons but yet we were
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
there so over the decade that I
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
experienced this I can confident ly say
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
that my blind trust in the concept of
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
court and expectation that truth and
 
00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
evidence would put an end to the post
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
divorce rivality and abuses was actually
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the end the very qualities I felt
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
they were looking for to protract the
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
case and it fostered
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
conflict and it also revealed a lot of
 
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
perjury and in one of your handouts
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see it says perjury in Family
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
Court of New Hampshire this was written
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
by a Manchester attorney named Shauna El
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
Brown She subtitled it the truth the
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
whole truth or well something like the
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
truth and if you'll refer to the first
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
page of it in the second paragraph and
 
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
the second
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
sentence it talks about due to the
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
nature of family court system potential
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
for perjury is great and if that's the
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
case as she goes on to to absolutely
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
solidify due process is being subverted
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
at every
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
angle every
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
institution further down she says
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
professional conduct rule 3.3 requires
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
us all to correct the
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
record instead the attorneys quit and
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
they never correct the record and that
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
happened in my case a
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
lot and later you'll hear me speak that
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
that we had over 15 attorneys in the
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
decade on the second page you'll notice
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
that she talks about perjury occurring
 
00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:43.559 align:start position:0%
and the result and and and I'm bringing
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
this up because this is what I felt and
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
what I
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
experienced is that the offending party
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
being awarded for their conduct while
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
providing no relief at all
 
00:42:59.750 --> 00:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
for me and my children the innocent
 
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
party and yet we incurred all the legal
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
expenses and the emotional dpress and
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
lack of effort
 
00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
or as far as I could tell the court
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
interest in revealing the
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
process the reality that she writes is
 
00:43:20.829 --> 00:43:20.839 align:start position:0%
the same thing I
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
experience the party who is willing to
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
lie under oath is oftentimes rewarded
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
while those who attempt to tell the
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
truth are
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
not this is beyond the norm to me and a
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
big D process issue because I found out
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
that my case was basically based on
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
perjury there was no due process they
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
were artificially creating the
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
case and please understand this is a
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
post divorce case everything was said
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and done we were safe the other person
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
was free to do what they want wanted but
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
here we are pulled back in for no reason
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
that was evident no evidence evident it
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
was just repeated process that went on
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
years she does offer some some things on
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
the back page um about Solutions she
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
says that attorneys need to start
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
reporting issues and taking any and all
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
necessary steps to ensure that perjury
 
00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
is taken seriously
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's a due process
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
issue this includes requesting orders
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
from the Family Division to refer that
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
perjury issue for prosecution to the
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office these are
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
things I tried to get done myself and
 
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
was constantly met with one thing and
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
that was this is the way it's
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
done and if you do this you might not
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
see your
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
children and that was a constant threat
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
I would like to um just
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
ask I know you had some involvement with
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
DCF or you tried to reach out to them
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
for help um so I'm sorry to stop you in
 
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
the middle of your testimony um we want
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
to kind of keep the testimony focused um
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
can you just explain how what's going on
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
in the divorce court relates to
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
DCF because if DCF had actually done
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
what needed to be done at that point in
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
time there was and they were well aware
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
that there was the opportunity for my
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
children to be removed from the country
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
and the state they were well aware of
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
the assault that already
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
occurred and yet it was just not enough
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
for them to get involved to help us so
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
again we wind up back in family
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
court with this due process perjury
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
issue and as I've already heard somebody
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
talk about it seems like it's just
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
accusation and you know we either accept
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
it or we
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
don't so that's why family court in my
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
case is a major
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
question representative Weber or
 
00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so much for allowing
 
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
me this followup I'm just trying to
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
clarify where we are at this point yeah
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah um so your concern specifically
 
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.230 align:start position:0%
yeah um so your concern specifically
with

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
DCF was that they
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
did not follow up and react in ways that
 
00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
did not follow up and react in ways that
you

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
thought they ought to um and that they
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
were not as serious as they perhaps
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
should have been about the concerns that
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
you had about their kids is that a fair
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
statement or am I
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding because the I just want
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
to clarify that the thrust of this
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
particular um
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee is DCF and whether they are
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
fulfilling their duties and the family
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
courts is is a whole different thing and
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
I understand that it is part of your
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
story but for us the focus has to be on
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
the DCF portion so I just wanted to be
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
sure that was clear and thank you and
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for allowing that
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
so before you continue I'll go just a a
 
00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:25.559 align:start position:0%
step further to clarify so the the DCF
 
00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
um statutes are intertwined with the
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
family court statutes um but I think
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
that the way that certain cases are
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
dealt with in Family Court by those
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
statutes depending on the nature of them
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
um it it might be a different
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
experience so there there is overlap for
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
sure with the with the family court so
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's not totally out of the Wheelhouse
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
of this committee um but the point is
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
taken yes um let's relate it to and
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
that's where we're getting back to right
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
at the moment which is and to your point
 
00:47:59.230 --> 00:47:59.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the introduction on this
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
the reason that I mentioned the out of
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
state issues is that is exactly what
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
happened we had parental orders in place
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
and everything I kept telling it was
 
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
happening was going to happen I'd been
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
threatened with it I knew I was giving
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
them the
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
facts one of the attempts was literally
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
taking my two youngest kids to
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
France everything was in place they were
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
already enrolled in an American School
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
luckily another agency and and it was a
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
school system believe it or not um
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
intervened and that we were able to stop
 
00:48:38.829 --> 00:48:38.839 align:start position:0%
the removal of the kids at that point
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
and get them back in the United
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
States the second event why I tried to
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
approach dcyf again saying look it's
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
already happened once I know this is
 
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:51.559 align:start position:0%
going to happen again I just don't know
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
where it happened again with one child
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
so the the next child was removed and
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
sent out of state A th000 miles away to
 
00:48:59.839 --> 00:49:01.109 align:start position:0%
sent out of state A th000 miles away to
complete

00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
complete
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
strangers and again I could not get any
 
00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:06.799 align:start position:0%
help every time I went for help it was
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
well you're in family court they'll
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
solve it if my daughter went to the
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
police for help you got to go to Family
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
Court so so no matter what agency we
 
00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:15.190 align:start position:0%
Court so so no matter what agency we
went

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
went
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
to it was Family Court related and yet
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get help and it was just
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
being pushed back into that
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
system so does that help clarify okay
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and and I will add
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
that in the scenario when a child has
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
been removed it it does actually qualify
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
under the kidnapping law and while that
 
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
was brought up in
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
court they do not apply the law in court
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
so it was thrown out and considered
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
irrelevant the child did not willingly
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
go but the child definitely came back
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
and the minute she was back she was
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with severe your complex
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
PTSD she is now an adult and she still
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
is in taking care of her health and
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
putting that first to undo what was done
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
to her which could have been prevented
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
if we'd had the right resources in place
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
so the due process issues for me could
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
be in any
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
agency but a lot of it happened in
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
family courp because that's where we
 
00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:23.559 align:start position:0%
referred to over and over and over so
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
what I did for you guys is an appendix a
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
sheet I outline the the subjects of due
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
process that not only have I heard from
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
my case itself but heard from other
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
people and in those due process issues
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of lot of issue and that's
 
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
just 32 of them that somehow relates
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
back to due process and you'll see near
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
the bottom I really do specifically talk
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
about and I've heard this from other
 
00:50:57.309 --> 00:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
people the removal of children from a
 
00:50:58.990 --> 00:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
parent without evidence or trial and the
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
removal of Rights and Freedoms and
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
Liberties without trial then you have no
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism to get them back in the state
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
did anybody find it yes find that thank
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
you so there was no legal remedies no
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
matter what we did and we had to go
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
through this with no way out what I
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
didn't understand
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
was the makeup of the family court I did
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
not understand that that wasn't a judge
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
or that these orders were invalid or
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
that they were full of the liel they
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
were full of that I could do something
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
with that I had no ideas about that and
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
nobody in the organization was sharing
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
no matter how many questions I asked so
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
again my kids wound up being the
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
victims of something
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
horrific that had already been settled
 
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
with divorce and had already been
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
settled when I went into court the first
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
time in Family Court saying there's
 
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to be here but we went into
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
family court on I guess we would call it
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
a modification the other party decided
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to pay they weren't
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
going to work they weren't going to
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
whatever and over that period of time it
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
just snowballed into a decade of
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
horrible horrible things so the dcyf
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
piece for me is very valid and very real
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
but again I was pushed off on other
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
issues ending in the due process
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
problems is that
 
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
helpful any questions from the members
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
Comm representative L thank you madam
 
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
chairwoman uh thank you for your
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
testimony uh was was there a complaint
 
00:52:43.069 --> 00:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
filed with
 
00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
DCF yes I the very beginning I I filed a
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
complaint with DCF yes okay and was a
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
complaint on abuse or neglect or
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
potential I always presented things as
 
00:52:54.839 --> 00:52:55.910 align:start position:0%
potential I always presented things as
potential

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
okay but there was evidence so there was
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
a trial of his assault okay uh and also
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh your your decree uh was he was
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
your X allowed to remove children from
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
the state I love this question so thank
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
you for asking it um no not without
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
permission um but more
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
importantly in the decree uh he really
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want them but I thought for him
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
to at least have them twice a
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
month and I almost felt like what
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
transpired later though I'm not going to
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
say it's
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
fact was because I wanted him to be able
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
to parent his kids or at least have time
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
with them as he got older I mean maybe
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
he was going through something whatever
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
I really fought for that and I got it
 
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
put in the
 
00:53:49.319 --> 00:53:51.789 align:start position:0%
put in the
decree

00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:51.799 align:start position:0%
decree
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
so we both had the same rules set in
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
place if we were going to leave the
 
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
state you know we had to notify it um in
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
our particular case he was like you know
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
go anywhere you want this side of the
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
Mississippi go go away go you know it
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
was fine it was all in the decree
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
children and I were free to do as we
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
wanted so how do we end up back here in
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
family court with our rights being taken
 
00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
away and the kids being
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
kidnapped it it's an issue because dcyf
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
could have helped us out okay
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh just one last if I may uh where was
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
it currently where I'm sorry what are
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
you still threatened current currently
 
00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
where does this stand did this mine
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
ended in uh about about after 12 years
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
it ended so in
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
2019 we were out of Family Court
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
finally however we're stuck and I think
 
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
this is important for everybody to
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
understand because I know the victims
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
will understand it when I say it you're
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
stuck with orders of Lial
 
00:54:58.589 --> 00:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
you're stuck with them and you have no
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
way to get rid of them and that due
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
process thank you represent thank you
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
madam chairman and thank you for being
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
here and sharing your testimony so I I
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
just want want to understand so you you
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
said that you put it in the decree that
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
he had to you know have the kids two
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
times had to he agreed to it eventually
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay but that that was important to you
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
that was important to me AB absolutely
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
was it before that or after that that
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
you told DCF that you um thought that
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
there could be some kind of abuse that
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
they needed to look at it was before and
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
thanks I have a question you mentioned
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
that the orders were not
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
enforceable and I understand that the
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
orders for um you know parenting plans
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
that come from dcyf petitions also come
 
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
from the same court so can you speak to
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
that yeah enforceability um I will start
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
with the fact that
 
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
enforceability for me began when I found
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
out I couldn't use my divorce decree as
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
evidence then I started saying okay but
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
where do I go What mechanisms do I have
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
no you got to go through this it's the
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
way it's done fine now we're getting
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
these rulings and you know we're opening
 
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
up the child um situation we're going to
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
start separating them out eventually
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
they were all separated out and and I
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
had no way to get them back together so
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
I kept asking the court enforce the
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
divorce decree enforce what we just you
 
00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
know agreed upon last week and slowly
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
step by step by step they wound up
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
removing the kids
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
completely and here we are again stuck
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
Out representative Weber
 
00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
so could I follow up on that when you
 
00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
say they removed the kids are we talking
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
the court the court so did the kids go
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
to their father or did the kids go okay
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the two youngest one went went to
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
the father okay so basically what it was
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
was a complete reversal of the initial
 
00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:23.720 align:start position:0%

committee as my background is

biochemistry pharmaceutical development
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh nuclear engineering Navy
 
00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:21.559 align:start position:0%
submarines but I ran for office and in
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
doing that activity I knocked on Doors
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
and I always asked
 
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
people what is it that you're concerned
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
about with state government I may hear a
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff about the teds but every
 
00:59:38.029 --> 00:59:38.039 align:start position:0%
once in a while I'm I'm GNA get that
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
that answer uh that relates to
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
activities with the state and too often
 
00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:45.990 align:start position:0%
activities with the state and too often
it

00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
was the family court system
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
dcyf um we're dealing with Liars court
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
and people that aren't aren't uh
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
doing their job and they are hurting
 
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
people they're hurting individuals and
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
if you conf fix it it would be
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
great so uh no legislature can do that
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
on their own but I did sponsor last year
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
hr14 which turned into the special
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
commission looking at Family Court
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
basically a parallel to this
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:26.589 align:start position:0%
basically a parallel to this
organization

01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
what I want to commend this committee to
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
do and you've done it today is truly
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
listen to those people that are grieved
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
you have citizens that have been hurt
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
seriously hurt and they carry that pain
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
forward for extended periods of
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
time do not listen or put your faith in
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
presentations by agencies or judges that
 
01:00:58.589 --> 01:00:58.599 align:start position:0%
talk to you for an hour an hour and a
 
01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
half telling you how wonderful their
 
01:01:01.039 --> 01:01:02.150 align:start position:0%
half telling you how wonderful their
systems

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
are because that's what they think you
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
know they're
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
doing listen to the people that have the
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
problems it is only by doing that that
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
you are going to identify the patterns
 
01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:18.230 align:start position:0%
you are going to identify the patterns
of

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
activity or the problem areas with the
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
systems that you can then get your hands
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
around and potentially create solutions
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
to you're not going to hear the the
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
problems coming from the agencies you're
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
going to hear the problems coming from
 
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.039 align:start position:0%
the people it's that simple and that's
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%

of the of it was probably the most
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
common complaint that I had there's
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%

elements of due process and you uh
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%

understanding of the Essential Elements
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
of due
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%

01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative LOM former Chief Justice
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh he articulated in that speech the
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
minimum elements of due process for uh
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
an activity that was non-judicial so
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
here here's here's hearings or or or
 
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
proceedings in front of uh the uh uh
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
University tribunals or whatever about
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
various problems that they're they're uh
 
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.630 align:start position:0%
various problems that they're they're uh
nominally

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
nominally
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
investigating um and he articulated in
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
that speech the very minimum elements
 
01:04:20.589 --> 01:04:20.599 align:start position:0%
that one should be concerned about from
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
a due process standpoint if you're in
 
01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.710 align:start position:0%
a due process standpoint if you're in
court

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
those elements should be even greater
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
but these were the minimum so I commend
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
you to to uh review his speech and when
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
you think about what element should DC
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
DCF be using when it is reviewing cases
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's an agency it's not a court those
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
same criteria ought to be your minimum
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
criteria you look
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
at thank you
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you again for
 
01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:01.750 align:start position:0%

of it was strict
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
and it was very eye
 
01:06:59.950 --> 01:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
opening they didn't give me any
 
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
paperwork they didn't give me any
 
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
notices they didn't give me anything I

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
blur the adjudication was a
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
blur nobody defended me my lawyer didn't
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
defend me I was never asked I never even
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
spoke up until just
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
recently I've studied this for the past
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
360 days
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
now there is no due process in my case
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
there's not
 
01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
one sign of due process not even them
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
trying until recently uh when I stood up
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
at the last three minutes of my hearing
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
I said your honor I'd like to speak if I
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
could and the record off the needle they
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
could not believe I wanted to say
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
something I've had it
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
the only one paying for this is me and
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
my daughter I'm the only one she's got
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
they dragged family that is toxic to my
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
mental health in to this and no
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
relationship with my daughter who's
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%

01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
really and this family member is able to
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
take my daughter on sleepovers on the
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%

substantial compliance with all my
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%

exactly what is told I have not given
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
the one removed her she was off the case
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
immediately my second one I didn't hear
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
from her for months and now the new one
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
that I have thinks I am
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
threatening and that I
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
am GNA follow them to their new foster
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
home I don't have a car and she's very
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
aware of this um the reports that they
 
01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
give to the court are nothing but
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
defamation of my character um I'm known
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
to many as a big crybaby as you can tell
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
I'm choking them back for this I have
 
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
not done
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
anything that has been threatening what
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
I've done is tell the truth what I've
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
done is follow the court order they took
 
01:09:27.950 --> 01:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
Christmas from us it was ordered by the
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
judge that she would stay home she the
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
judge looked at my daughter and said I
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
Eve Saturday on the 23rd of December I
 
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:41.799 align:start position:0%
got a phone call from a number I don't
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
know from a woman I don't know from the
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
division telling me that my visit was
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
canceled no sleepover no explanation no
 
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
nothing the foster mom that I had before
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
the one now we had a a working
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
relationship we had a business
 
01:10:03.189 --> 01:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
relationship and it took a long time and
 
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate her very much still to
 
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.830 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate her very much still to
this

01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
day we said we'll just do it by the book
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
we'll follow we'll just do it like this
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
they made up they not no cpsw was there
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
there was like five Cruisers and we knew
 
01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
this was going to happen and I I just we
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
followed everything I brought all my
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
paperwork I showed in the court order I
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
did everything I was supposed to do I
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
never not one thing in the report that
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
DCF made to the court was true not a
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
lick of it and none of them were there
 
01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
the police report I tried to obtain it
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
and of course I'm not going to be able
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
to get it within 90 days so that's out
 
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
of the question I'm still waiting for it
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
because I will bring it
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
up the fact that the judge looked at my
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
daughter and said you want to stay home
 
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.390 align:start position:0%
daughter and said you want to stay home
for

01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
Christmas and then I told the DCF worker
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
the DCF worker you tell her so I put her
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
on speaker phone in the middle of
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
hanford's I said you tell her that you
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
took Christmas from her she didn't like
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm tired of letting my daughter
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
down they have took visits from us and
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
reason I'm exhausted and I'm not done
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
we're coming up on a
 
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
year I firmly believe and this isn't all
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
this isn't we're not cuzz you know I'm
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
not going to get any honesty from them
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
that she's with priod doters currently
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
when she was supposed to transition home
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's no Fosters left and
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
conquered I was I stayed with the Foster
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
system when they removed her instead of
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
going to family so she could stay at her
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
school because it would have been
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
normaly for her and I didn't know how
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
bad this was going to go they said it
 
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:48.709 align:start position:0%
bad this was going to go they said it
was

01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
temporary and a year later she's been
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
moved it's been I've had
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
three lawyers three cpsws three judges
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
the only thing she two foster homes and
 
01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
the new one now they think I'm a monster
 
01:12:04.990 --> 01:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
because they believe dcyf and all the
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
reports that they make that I'm a
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
monster they don't let me talk to her
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
and one year I have never missed a phone
 
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
call at 6 PM that phone would ring on
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
and she'd pick it up because the fostor
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
mom knew I was going to call at 6 o' I
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%

beat and now I'm a monster and I'm go
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I already am very well aware the
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
court has not been Fair there has been
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
no from the point of removal I have
 
01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
court on the
 
01:12:42.199 --> 01:12:44.629 align:start position:0%
court on the
14th

01:12:44.629 --> 01:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
14th
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I I pray to God every
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
day that this is going to go in my favor
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
I have a new lawyer I haven't talked
 
01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
him it's all based off one thing drug
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
testing they drug test in a clinical
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
level there needs to be forensic testing
 
01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
in court so if the the do is doing it
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
and drug court and probation then Family
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
Court needs to do it also DCF came to my
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
house on several occasions took urine
 
01:13:21.669 --> 01:13:21.679 align:start position:0%
samples from me and off they went and
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
those were the ones that were positive
 
01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
I have them all no med list no this no
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm not on drugs finally for once
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
in my life I'm sober for five years from
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol I'm an
 
01:13:38.189 --> 01:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
alcoholic I was at the sober home
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
because no other facility would take me
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
because I'm not on drugs and I'm not
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
drunk they don't see that and I took
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
their recommendations and I did the very
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
I found the very hardest home I could go
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
to so structured it was faith-based it
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
was a Christian home and I still to this
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
day I have that Bible right behind me it
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
comes to every court date because the
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
only thing I got in this is God right
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
now I can't do any more than what I'm
 
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
doing I've done it all I've finished
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
parenting class I've done I've finished
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
my program which was amazing it's like
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
the first certificate I ever have from a
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
program that I was proud of and they
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
just they they never even they never
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
even mentioned it you never even
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned it I had a amazing letter
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
written by my
 
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
lak the lak at their office doesn't want
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
to he doesn't even want to meet with me
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
no more he's like I just don't want
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
anything to do with this case all of a
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
sudden he can't read drug test results
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
people are avoiding this case like the
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
plague and I and all I'm doing is
 
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
Trucking along doing what I'm told now
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
they can call my lawyer I'm scared of
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
them I just filled out my Ada request I
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
can't do this anymore with them the
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
division they violate court orders and
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's okay I would go to jail I would go
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
to jail they can lie to the court I
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
would go to jail and they get away with
 
01:15:00.030 --> 01:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
they were told by the judge you are not
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
to go above a judge's order it was the
 
01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
first thing said within five minutes of
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
the last hearing the very next day
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what they did the
 
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
opposite I'm tired of them and what they
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
get away with the due process
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
is it's been completely violated in many
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
cases but this there hasn't been any I
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
had to look at up after a year there's
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
been 14 I think uh statutes violated in
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
my case and I haven't even made it
 
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
through the rest of it because I can't I
 
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
can't even stomach it and I start
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
crying I I listen to people and I'm like
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
wow something needs to happen this isn't
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
just here this is all over the place but
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
I feel like here in in New Hampshire
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
specifically conquered where I'm in only
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself it's like taboo you
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
can't talk you can't talk about it you
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
can't do anything this is the first time
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
I'm saying anything about my case nobody
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
wants to hear it nobody wants
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
to I'll blast it across the media at
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
this point my daughter was to transition
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
home and she's been taken further away
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
she's been taken from me less visits
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
less parent parenting time no phone
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%

YouTube and
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere and somebody hears something
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
pain in your voice and I understand this
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
has been a very difficult ordeal for you
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
um would you be able to give us the list
 
01:16:59.629 --> 01:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
of those rsas that you have found um
 
01:16:59.639 --> 01:17:00.590 align:start position:0%
of those rsas that you have found um
were

01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
violated and if you have you don't mind
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
the if you don't mind the uh highlighter
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's fine and um yeah th
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
those are particularly helpful to have
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
those concrete examples of exactly where
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
they went off and I just have a question
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%

01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
let you know what your rights were no
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
ma'am um it actually it's funny because
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
I get laughed at about this all the time
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
by many cps's cpsws so there's a trifold
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
brochure a pamphlet if you will um that
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%

meeting well I had to print them I found
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
them actually my boyfriend found them
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
months later and uh we printed them out
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
and I wish they would have given me that
 
01:17:48.149 --> 01:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
it explains everything explains the
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%

vague I mean that's in that's in one of
 
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:06.280 align:start position:0%

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
great relationship with unbelievable so
 
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
when we did the home visit um she sent
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
somebody else I didn't know and who was
 
01:19:09.629 --> 01:19:09.639 align:start position:0%
a very nice woman and we walked around
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
the we had a good time and I did the
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
drug test because we while she was there
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
and then I
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
realized that was kind of weird no like
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
I've never I've been in I have I've been
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
in court before I've been in trouble
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
before and I've done some drug testing
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
I've never seen anything like this my
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
sister works at a prison and we've been
 
01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
kind of there is no I signed
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
nothing I signed nothing I actually
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
currently have three contracts that are
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
null and void with um the lab the rois
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
and just the foundation's counseling
 
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
which is the way act within the division
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
um so I'm really not bound to them right
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
now so I did um take five separate tests
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
with Quest Diagnostics and um the cpsw
 
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
never picked them up and because of
 
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
HIPPA law it states I in a court
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding cannot obtain my own results
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
so they went down the drain yeah
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
I and I I tried to get in touch with her
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
she knew I was going this was months ago
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
after I took the first test with um The
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
Division I realized that this was not I
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
was like that just seems weird to me
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
they just throw it in a bag and off it
 
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
goes like it's no ice no nothing
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
whatever so I said let me try Quest and
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
she never picked them up so I did it
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
again and I tried to do it smart so I
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
took a test with the division one day
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
and then I took a test with my doctor
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
and then I took a test I tried to get
 
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
into quests but I couldn't get in before
 
01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:44.550 align:start position:0%
into quests but I couldn't get in before
they

01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
closed they all do clinical testing so
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
if you're on any kind of medication that
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
needs further testing which it'll tell
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
tell you right when you get your
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
prescription that the painting in the
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
neck papers that they give you read them
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
last page Black Box warnings I knew none
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
of this until now they need to do
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
further testing after the confirmatory
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
i' I'm working with samama actually um
 
01:21:12.189 --> 01:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
to implement um Federal testing forensic
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
testing in child welfare cases because
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is absolutely the only reason I
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
don't have my
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
daughter I mean so they tested it at
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
like an NG which is little tiny bits
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
and I was like registering at
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
80.1 80.6 which is like a drop in an
 
01:21:31.629 --> 01:21:31.639 align:start position:0%
ocean and now all of a sudden I'm back
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
on my meds because I'm out of the sober
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
home and I didn't even know they would
 
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
register at what they would what they
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
are but they do and it's in the
 
01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:41.800 align:start position:0%
thousands now all of a sudden they're
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
positive and I'm like but I'm okay I
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
gave them all the documentation they
 
01:21:50.110 --> 01:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
asked for the pharmacist my prescriber
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
everything blackbox warning I gave him
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
the prescription they don't Quest would
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
have done the testing the way I but it
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
was like
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
$250 could I help you follow up with me
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
because I think that might be something
 
01:22:05.229 --> 01:22:05.239 align:start position:0%
that's in something that can be sort of
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
pulled out of this whole process but
 
01:22:09.149 --> 01:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
sounds like a really significant issue
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
that we need to deal with but that might
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
be served better outside of this fullo
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
process thing but this is a significant
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
problem that has violated you do process
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
AB but it may be able to be discreet so
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
I'll give you my information yes ma'am
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you on the 14 they actually uh
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
well DCF was told that they need to
 
01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
bring in an expert if they're going to
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
speak on drug testing results because
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
they are not ladex so I'm going to
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
LC any questions from the committee
 
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative W uh thank you madam
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
chair I'm a person of longtime recovery
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
I let the tears out all the time but if
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
I don't I use the Fest I'd rather let
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
the tears out um so you're doing all
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
right you're doing better than all right
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
all now you you mentioned the two
 
01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
um two urine test positive all of them
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
have been positive except for one in
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
August and I actually had covid right
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
before so which is weird because I
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
thought definitely that was going to
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
come up positive for meds or something
 
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
okay and you're saying that it it wasn't
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
a deep enough dive into the P I know I
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
tested positive with uh eating OPI Opie
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh eating poppy seeds yeah and they have
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
to do I mean I got let go from work and
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
they had to pay me um to find out that I
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
was eating poppy seeds you know um so I
 
01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:29.719 align:start position:0%
I understand where a lot of times it's a
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
deeper dive and that's the positive ones
 
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying that's what that was yes
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
all of them have been so with the due
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
process with this involved with like due
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
process in court when I
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
presented I gave them what they asked
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
for but they're not going to present it
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
let me I will so I did and I told the
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
judge I said I've asked I've asked for
 
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
further testing on samples and they
 
01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
refused use and then I won't hear from
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
them at all like like they avoid it
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
until they want another test every I'm
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
I'm loading the ammo into the firing
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
squad that's pointing at me every time I
 
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
take a test with them and then they're
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
saying I refuse but here I am you know
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
at the division for Open Access like
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
trying to comply I picked up a contact
 
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
log the very first page said I'm a rock
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
star I'm killing this program the last
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
page says that I'm
 
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
threatening I'm frustrated because for
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
once I'm actually doing the right thing
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
in my life because it's my daughter like
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
my my child my only child and why
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I do everything you ask me to
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
do why and why would I become
 
01:24:34.510 --> 01:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
threatening I become frustrated you know
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not being heard I'm not getting Fair
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
trial I'm not I'm not getting I like I
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
said I just spoke it's been a year for
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
the first time and and it's about drug
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
testing so I hope that on the 14th this
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
is mentioned like you know let's play
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
fair you know if this is going to be the
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
issue the drug testing and their own
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
handbook policy and procedure they're
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
not following they'll test me back to
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
back they'll test me on a Tuesday and
 
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
then they'll call me on Wednesday and
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
I'm like busy and they give me an hour
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
to get down there you know I mean it's
 
01:25:09.510 --> 01:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
just frustration not threatening and yet

as you know I mean I've completed a
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
program I was in a sober home but they
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
didn't see it as that and then they did
 
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
in the next report
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's very hard to remain sober when
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
they keep telling me that I'm on
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
drugs he good luck on the 14th thank you

01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
every three
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
months uh and I'm on medication and I
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't do illegal drugs and I also have
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
been tested positive for poppy seeds so
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't do drugs so I empathize with
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
your journey and I think that part is
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
very crucial on getting to the bottom of
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
you hearing that just look you made me
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
cry hearing that just it it confirms a
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
lot like crazy sometimes we need to be
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
validated yes
 
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
ma'am I have a couple of questions for
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
you um you had stated that DCF lied to
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
the court could you elaborate on that
 
01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:40.790 align:start position:0%
the court could you elaborate on that
um

01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
there's I have everything I I didn't
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
know how this goes so I just
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
brought uh like their reviews their
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
reports and I brought out the orders um
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
you are more than welcome to to them um
 
01:26:57.310 --> 01:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
the the lies the
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
contradictions and then the lies are are
 
01:27:00.159 --> 01:27:01.030 align:start position:0%
contradictions and then the lies are are
kind

01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
kind
 
01:27:05.109 --> 01:27:05.119 align:start position:0%
of I mean there's so many okay person so
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
many so are you able to maybe summarize
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
where they violated rsay summarize where
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
they I wrote them at all the top of
 
01:27:15.629 --> 01:27:15.639 align:start position:0%
everything okay um just at The X parte
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
169 C uh 6B 169 C30 yeah we we'll take a
 
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.830 align:start position:0%
169 C uh 6B 169 C30 yeah we we'll take a
list

01:27:22.830 --> 01:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
and that would be super helpful just for
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
us to it down this whole thing and um I
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
will take your question in one second
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
and then I just wanted to know um also
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
if you could give us a list of where
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
they um in what instances they violated
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
yes you have I'm sorry and you have been
 
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
very circumspect and very careful in
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
what you say to us and I realize that
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
that's an incredibly hard um tight RPP
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
to walk and we appreciate you're doing
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
it um I was just asked to remind
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
everybody that this is an open case and
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Dyer maybe you can help us if if
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
if we take any of the stuff that you
 
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
have it has to be redacted is that
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
correct so you would have to make sure
 
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
that all the names
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
were magic Market out or something like
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
that is would that be the best way for
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.679 --> 01:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
right yes and I I think for again as as
 
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon said earlier uh this
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
may be something where uh um we need to
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
find out exactly what we can have
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
because everything that we take in is
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
public knowledge and we don't want to
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
let toothpaste out of the tube about
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
your private life or in particularly
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
your child's private life uh in any way
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
that could either reveal information
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be revealed or get you
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
into some kind of trouble where what
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do is walk the line and
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
express your concerns which is you're
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
right uh so I'm I'm hoping that did you
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
give us contact information when you
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
filled in your minimal because I wasn't
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
sure okay um you might want to provide
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
that to us later on so that we could get
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
in touch with you uh rather than
 
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
taking information in that we shouldn't
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
have taken and that we don't want to
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
contribute to making anybody's situation
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
worse oh please yeah no
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
understandable um that's why I didn't
 
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
make copies I wasn't sure like I said I
 
01:29:57.950 --> 01:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
didn't know how this goes and with it
 
01:30:00.430 --> 01:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
being an open case I wasn't sure that's
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
why I had like you know the statutes
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
which is obviously um and the other
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
things I have like things that um I've
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
that have been written about me um that
 
01:30:13.149 --> 01:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
never got submitted into court that you
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
know it's just how it's on due
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
process um the other thing I'd like to
 
01:30:22.510 --> 01:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
bring up is that I have the the court
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
sum the summary the case summary and
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
they had eight return to send her pieces
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
of mail that I never changed my address
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
I had another case that was open that
 
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
kind of was the whole reason I got into
 
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
this case and I never got one piece of
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
mail from them I went to the courthouse
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
where she said you have some returned
 
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
mail and she gave me a stack it was all
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
my rights to appeal it was all my
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
hearing notices and then all my
 
01:30:57.109 --> 01:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
orders everything up until
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
November and I knew I obtained all this
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
stuff like as time has gone on they have
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
never given me anything so I have never
 
01:31:07.709 --> 01:31:07.719 align:start position:0%
signed anything except for my
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of tpr if I don't comply
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
and uh the action safety plan in the
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
very beginning that's the only things
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
I've ever signed and the one other thing
 
01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
that I is now null and
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
void represent Cal
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I just wanted
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
to ask for clarification about the male
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
situation that you just described so am
 
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
I to understand that the court mailed
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
documents to
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
you those were returned as undeliverable
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
or rejected return refused Return to
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
Sender what on What basis were they
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
delivered are they they would typically
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
be marked on the I know and my
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
boyfriend's a letter carrier so we have
 
01:31:52.030 --> 01:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
a like good relationship with with my
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
mealman not him but we know how the I
 
01:31:57.870 --> 01:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
worked for UPS so I mean he works for
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
USPS so there's no reason because I
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
never changed my address what I did was
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
have a hold at the post office for my
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
mail the only thing I did change was DHS
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
because I was at the sober home and it
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
allowed my food stamps and stuff because
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
I paid for that sober home to go there
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
so there was no RTS on anything it was
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
just I never have I have don't have any
 
01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
of the envelopes that would have said
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
any of that what I have is the stuff
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
that was inside of
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
it a follow up okay followup so when
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
that when those items were given to you
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
court with the statement that these were
 
01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:38.280 align:start position:0%
returned to us as undeliverable or
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
refused or something they were not
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
contained in an outer envelope no sir
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
they had um they had a binder that was
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
clipped at the top and it was just like
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
a two ring binder that she even had to
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
go get another clerk because she said
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
she's never seen anything like this so
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
and she had to sign everything out so
 
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yes sir thank you
 
01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.109 align:start position:0%

even gone to court with me yet we've met
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
once we've talked three times on the
 
01:33:34.830 --> 01:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
phone um the the first attorney I had he
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
gave nothing I gave him stuff he gave
 
01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
nothing to the court
 
01:33:43.149 --> 01:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
he I'll just say I don't I don't have
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
anything nice to say so I just have
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
nothing to say about that um the second
 
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
attorney she was amazing she did two he
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
hearings Court was in my favor things
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
got turned around substantial compliance
 
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
balling my eyes out of the courtroom and
 
01:34:02.109 --> 01:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
hugging my kid and now that she left um
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
she she with through after the last
 
01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
hearing and they got a new attorney
 
01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
which was the attorney I was trying to
 
01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
go for the minute I left the sober home
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
they have her now so I'm get like I was
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
like Wow plot twist and she's vicious
 
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how he's going to do it
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
but he seems very confident and he has a
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
expert witness and I just pray the 14th
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
is going to go well I haven't I've given
 
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
him some stuff but I guess he has a box
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
full of stuff I've asked for the
 
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
discovery from the division part the way
 
01:34:36.629 --> 01:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to they won't give it to
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
me um the email was actually intercepted
 
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
um because I got a response back and
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
then it was um one of the the head field
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
reps emailed me back ironically so it's
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
telling me you know or get it from your
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
lawyer which they know they knew that I
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
didn't really have a lawyer so could I
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
clarify further absolutely thank you so
 
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
um I got a little confused there so the
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
attorney that you have now is that the
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
attorney that has the whole box full of
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
information and have you made sure that
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
your current attorney has all of those
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
reports that you had yes and is aware of
 
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
those and so can get those to the court
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes so the first time we met we had a
 
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
very long meeting and uh it was we got a
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
lot done and I gave him everything I had
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
and he was pretty confident that you
 
01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
know a couple of things that I gave him
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
he was like well I so when I it was
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
funny because when I walked into his
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
office I he said oh the drug test
 
01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
results are back and I was like they've
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
been back they've been back twice now so
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
this is to be the third time different
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
copy same drug test three different
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
results so so is what you can see that
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get at
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
is are you
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
now whatever happened in the past are
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
you now receiving what you feel is
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
effective assistance of counsel as
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
opposed to a councel who isn't paying
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
attention I hope so okay I hope so I
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't know until we get in front of the
 
01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
judge at this point because I I had a
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of trust and faith in the system
 
01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
um because I've had you know I've been
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
through the system before and this I
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
don't have any faith in and you never
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
know this case changes on a daily basis
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
represent thank you thank you I just
 
01:36:36.510 --> 01:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to delve into that aspect because
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
it's an aspect we haven't talked about
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
yet and it's very helpful to hear your
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
perspective and thank you my first
 
01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
attorney I did ask him to withdraw um
 
01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
several times uh we did not have a good
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
relationship at all and he refused he
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually told me he was doing me a favor
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
by not withdrawing
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%

congratulations on your sobriety thank

you I it's more not so much a question
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
really it might be helpful for you to
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
tell us like specifically where DCF um
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
where you felt like they didn't do what
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to however before you
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
do any of that back to this is an open
 
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
case and you do have an attorney now I'm
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
not sure that I would give us much in
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
writing before you consult with your
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
attorney because we certainly don't want
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
to jeopardize your case or your daughter
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
on something small so I would just uh
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
highly suggest that you speak with your
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
attorney before giving us anything in
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
writing but we do hear you
 
01:38:23.310 --> 01:38:23.320 align:start position:0%

01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
um find interesting that the discussion
 
01:39:29.149 --> 01:39:29.159 align:start position:0%
here started about Oaths concerning
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
Oaths um we're hearing a lot of issues
 
01:39:37.229 --> 01:39:37.239 align:start position:0%
here about uh lack of uh
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
truthfulness lack of oversight a lack of
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
accountability and uh everything I'm
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
about to present here concerning due
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
process um all
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
really kind of goes back to that and I
 
01:39:56.950 --> 01:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
think that uh it's really important that
 
01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
we remember
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
that DCF and the legislators that are
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
involved with the oversight of
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
DCF all swear oath to the state
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
process the Bill of Rights in article 14
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
and Article 15
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh Reserve back to the people the right
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
to remedy Swift remedy without
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
denial supposed to be prompt and without
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
delay uh again that's something that
 
01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
we're not really Hearing in testimony
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%

what they have seen what they see in the
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
lack of due process here um in Article
 
01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:05.560 align:start position:0%

01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
shall be arrested imprisoned despoiled
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
or deprived of his property immunities
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
or privileges put out of the protection
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the law exiled or deprived of his
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
life liberty or estate but by the
 
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
Judgment of his peers or the law of the
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
land uh it's a maximum of law that no
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
free man shall be deprived of life
 
01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
liberty or property but by the lawful
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
Judgment of his peers or by the law of
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
the land that is the common
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
law uh blacks law fourth definition of
 
01:41:39.870 --> 01:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
the law of the land is due process of
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
law and so it's really interesting here
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
as you start to look into the founding
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
generation's understanding of what due
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
process is and how that is going to
 
01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
correlate to this term law of the land
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the Constitutional view which
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
everybody understands here is your main
 
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
prerogative and everything else is going
 
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
to follow out of and flow out of your
 
01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.830 align:start position:0%
to follow out of and flow out of your
constitutional

01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
obligations that these two terms really
 
01:42:11.589 --> 01:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
go hand
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
inand um so due process of law by law of
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
the land is most clearly intended that
 
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
again this is from uh Black's Law
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
intended the general law with hears
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
before it condemns which proceeds upon
 
01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:27.639 align:start position:0%
inquiry and renders judgment only after
 
01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
trial only after
 
01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
trial a blacks law fifth definition of
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
common law action is an action governed
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
by common law rather than statutory
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
Equitable or civil law so I want to
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
pause there for a second uh there's a
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion around the statutes
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
which may have been
 
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
violated um concerning a parent's right
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
process the parents rights as are
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
secured in the Constitution are common
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
law rights rights which have been
 
01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:03.639 align:start position:0%
understood in Antiquity and were very
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
well understood amongst the founding
 
01:43:09.709 --> 01:43:09.719 align:start position:0%
generation uh to exist regardless of
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
statutory law and in fact are secured
 
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
against uh any infringement by Statute
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's very very important here as we're
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
looking into the process uh into due
 
01:43:26.189 --> 01:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
process and something that uh it's
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
imperative that you really stress that
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
and look
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
into whether any statute which may be
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
enacted or has been enacted already can
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
deprive a parent of their
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
rights um and and interestingly in part
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
two uh discussing form of form of rits
 
01:43:50.189 --> 01:43:50.199 align:start position:0%
article 87 where it says all rits
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
issuing out out of the clerk's office
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
and any of the Courts of law uh Black's
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
Law defines court of law as in a narrow
 
01:43:59.589 --> 01:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
narrower sense a court proceeding
 
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
according to the course of common law
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
governed by its rules and principles as
 
01:44:06.229 --> 01:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
contrasted with a court of equity so
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
just really wanting to to nail down
 
01:44:14.669 --> 01:44:14.679 align:start position:0%
here due process as it pertains to
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
parents their rights to their children
 
01:44:19.910 --> 01:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
to be heard before they're deprived of
 
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
those rights
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
um is is a common law right that the
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
constitution secures now why am I going
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
back to these definitions and why am I
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
stressing uh
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
that the constitution understands the DU
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
the uh due process the concept of due
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
process in a certain way why did the
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
founders understand this in a certain
 
01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:44.870 align:start position:0%
founders understand this in a certain
way

01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:44:49.589 --> 01:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
well uh often we'll hear that the uh the
 
01:44:51.629 --> 01:44:51.639 align:start position:0%
standards have changed and that there's
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
different considerations and maybe DC
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
dcyf needs to be involved and certain
 
01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
statutes need to be enacted because the
 
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
world has changed because we have a
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
different understanding of uh of the
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
rights of the parents and how that
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
pertains to the
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
children um and not using a historical
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
analysis method and uh to that I would
 
01:45:18.030 --> 01:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
say that you you really need to pay
 
01:45:20.830 --> 01:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
attention to what's going on in the
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of the United States as
 
01:45:25.709 --> 01:45:25.719 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a RoR a return to the
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
historical analysis method
 
01:45:30.910 --> 01:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
so in a recent case out of
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
California uh justice Benitez in Fels
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
versus bont says quote the Supreme Court
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
focuses on the original understanding
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
and this was in a case uh pertaining to
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment specifically
 
01:45:47.709 --> 01:45:47.719 align:start position:0%
actually billy clubs in this case
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
but the original understanding of the
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment and thus requires
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
courts to give the greatest weight to
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
evidence from the time period of its
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
adoption that is because not all history
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
carries the same value he goes on to say
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
of the 39 Representatives who signed the
 
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution in
 
01:46:08.709 --> 01:46:08.719 align:start position:0%
1787 none were alive 50 years later
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
James Madison known as the father of the
 
01:46:13.149 --> 01:46:13.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution lived the longest passing
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
away in
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
1836 this is the most persuasive
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
evidence that the original understanding
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the second amendment protects a
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
person's right to keep and carry a billy
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
so in this case obviously they're
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
talking about a billy club but I I would
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
really stress to you the importance to
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
see that even the Supreme Court is
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
recognizing that for too long we have
 
01:46:38.109 --> 01:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
used that that government agents and and
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
officials have used precedent as an
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
excuse to violate the people's
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
rights uh in error when the true
 
01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
standard and again returning to to Due
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
Process the true standard must be the
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
historical understanding and when the
 
01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:57.790 align:start position:0%
historical understanding and when the
founders

01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
founders
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
wrote in our constitution the New
 
01:47:04.109 --> 01:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitution in the Bill of
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
Rights that the people should not be
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
deprived of their shall not be deprived
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
of their property of their life liberty
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
or state and I think we can all agree
 
01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:15.719 align:start position:0%
that children are liberty interest but
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
by the Judgment of their peers that that
 
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
is very specific specifically meant to
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
be understood as these people need to go
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
before a jury of their peers have the
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
right to trial by jury and for any
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
accuser and anybody who's going to make
 
01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
an accusation to have to swear an oath
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
attesting to the truthfulness of what
 
01:47:41.709 --> 01:47:41.719 align:start position:0%
they say before they can be deprived of
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
their children and of their right to be
 
01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:46.149 align:start position:0%
their children and of their right to be
a

01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
parent um you'll you'll see again in
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
Black's Law
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
that really you can summarize due
 
01:47:57.510 --> 01:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
process in this statement that if any
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
question of fact or liability be
 
01:48:03.149 --> 01:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
conclusively presumed against him this
 
01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
law um representative kushman you're
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
you're uh aware of uh wer V Plymouth and
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
that it's ripe with references to the uh
 
01:48:19.709 --> 01:48:19.719 align:start position:0%
the right of the people to a trial by
 
01:48:19.719 --> 01:48:21.310 align:start position:0%
the right of the people to a trial by
jury

01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
jury
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the things that are that
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
are stressed there in that decision is
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
that there is a very important
 
01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
distinction between part one and part
 
01:48:30.750 --> 01:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
two of our state
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
constitution uh part two Article 5 gives
 
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
authority to the general court uh to
 
01:48:40.990 --> 01:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
make laws and uh gives it gives it power
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
to enact certain statutes and
 
01:48:48.589 --> 01:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
such so long as quote the same be not
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
repugnant or contrary to this
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
constitution um it says that twice and
 
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
that's pretty important uh I think that
 
01:49:00.350 --> 01:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
they put that there twice because the
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
founders really wanted us to understand
 
01:49:04.470 --> 01:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
that any
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
discussion of Ru making um or statutory
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
Authority has to come underneath and
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
follow after the rights of the people as
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
is reserved to them in part
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
one as far as I'm aware there is no
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
Authority existing
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
anywhere to abridge the rights of the
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
people in part one if you can find that
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
granted to the general court
 
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere and especially the ability for
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
them to Grant something which wasn't
 
01:49:39.709 --> 01:49:39.719 align:start position:0%
granted for a body like DCF to abridge
 
01:49:42.669 --> 01:49:42.679 align:start position:0%
those rights I'd love to see it
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't think you're going to find it
 
01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
though these are constitutional rights
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and
 
01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:53.560 align:start position:0%
again Black's Law will inform us as to
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
what should be understood as a
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional right and that is one
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
that is so guaranteed as to prevent
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
therewi I don't think you need to go
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
much further than this if you can't
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
prove that there is any Authority
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
existing within the legislature any
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
bodies that it creates to take the
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
rights of the
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
people without a trial by jury
 
01:50:26.189 --> 01:50:26.199 align:start position:0%
of their peers who are sworn to the to
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
the truthfulness of the statements that
 
01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
that they're going to make um then then
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
you cannot take those rights and only
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
then can doe process
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
occur thank you thank you for your
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%

nothing's falling on the
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
be

02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%

repeat um issues that have been
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
raised I think we can boil it down to
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:17.310 align:start position:0%

02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
are some
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
handouts uh five in total uh for one
 
02:11:59.790 --> 02:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
pagers and then uh a stapled
 
02:12:03.229 --> 02:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
02:12:03.239 --> 02:12:07.189 align:start position:0%
one uh
in

02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
yes sorry proceed okay
 
02:12:15.669 --> 02:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh in my case there uh have been two
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
different uh agencies involved uh New
 
02:12:20.910 --> 02:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh
 
02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
DCF and also uh Los Angeles County
 
02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:27.030 align:start position:0%
DCF and also uh Los Angeles County
California

02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
California
 
02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
DCFS which is the analogous agency in
 
02:12:35.350 --> 02:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
California so I may refer to both uh
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:42.510 --> 02:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
DCFS uh I think uh first of all thank
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
you so much for taking the time to
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
really hear everyone here and really let
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
people people tell their stories and
 
02:12:53.709 --> 02:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for emphasizing the
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
need for truthfulness in these
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
procedings I think that's extremely
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
valuable um what I'd like to bring to
 
02:13:06.310 --> 02:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
your attention are what I consider to be
 
02:13:08.430 --> 02:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
due process
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
violations uh in my case uh relating to
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
the review of reports from both new DCF
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
DCFS uh to that
 
02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:27.229 align:start position:0%
DCFS uh to that
end

02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
end
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh the background of this is a uh family
 
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
law case in uh with myself and the other
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
party involving one adult child and
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
three minor child
 
02:13:40.679 --> 02:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
three minor child
children

02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh with both agencies there were cross
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
allegations of
 
02:13:52.870 --> 02:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
abuse uh the allegations of abuse
 
02:13:56.910 --> 02:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
Against Me by DCF were determined to be
 
02:14:01.629 --> 02:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
unfounded the allegations of abuse uh by
 
02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
the other party were uh found to be
 
02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
indeterminate uh meaning there was
 
02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:11.030 align:start position:0%
indeterminate uh meaning there was
probable

02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
probable
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
cause uh to suspect something was going
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
on uh but uh not enough to uh proceed
 
02:14:26.549 --> 02:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
further uh so uh essentially uh putting
 
02:14:29.149 --> 02:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
in good faith but we don't have
 
02:14:32.069 --> 02:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
enough uh you don't have those records
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
before you uh they're in the sealed
 
02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:36.830 align:start position:0%
before you uh they're in the sealed
pallet

02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
pallet
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
file uh I wouldn't personally have a
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
problem with you having them but I think
 
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
the court system would uh so let's not
 
02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:45.709 align:start position:0%
the court system would uh so let's not
do

02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
that um the issue comes and you've heard
 
02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
it earlier uh from so many people is
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
that these agencies are all intertwined
 
02:15:03.790 --> 02:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
so uh it goes to DCF or uh DCFS and then
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
it goes to the court system and then the
 
02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
court system has to do something with
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
that and in my case that's where things
 
02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh really fell short so in by November
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
6th uh 2020 family court hearing uh all
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
of these records are coming in as
 
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
evidence we've got cross allegations
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
with agencies we've got uh cross
 
02:15:32.669 --> 02:15:32.679 align:start position:0%
petitions to modify a parenting plan so
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
I would respectfully suggest this really
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
matters and that the
 
02:15:41.390 --> 02:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
judge uh you know maybe ought to look at
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
those uh instead uh during that hearing
 
02:15:50.669 --> 02:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
uh the judge said and uh I'm simply
 
02:15:58.030 --> 02:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
 at the time we didn't know he did
 
02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:04.599 align:start position:0%
that because it was a telephonic hearing
 
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
this is multi-state diversity of
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh so I'm in New Hampshire
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
judge is in a
 
02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
courtroom uh the other parties either in
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
California or Michigan we actually still
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
aren't sure which
 
02:16:19.599 --> 02:16:21.270 align:start position:0%
aren't sure which
uh

02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
and compounding due process from there
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
we then proceed to a falsification of
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
the court
 
02:16:31.429 --> 02:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
record and if you look
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
here uh there's an email from escribers
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
dated November 12th
 
02:16:42.150 --> 02:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
2020 uh concerning the court record that
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
says of course we are not going to
 
02:16:44.880 --> 02:16:46.230 align:start position:0%
says of course we are not going to
transcribe

02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
transcribe
 
02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
that so we are now uh intentionally
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
emitting the misconduct from the
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
official record that seems like a pretty
 
02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
serious due process
 
02:17:03.389 --> 02:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
violation uh if you go to the next
 
02:17:08.910 --> 02:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh and out here you have an email dated
 
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
November 13 2020 from chief
 
02:17:14.190 --> 02:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
administrative Judge David
 
02:17:18.990 --> 02:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
King uh sort of writing all about this
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
uh and telling uh the judicial officer
 
02:17:25.629 --> 02:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
there's an issue uh so at that time he's
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
fully aware there's transcription issues
 
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
there's a misconduct issue you know this
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
is all within a week of the hearing uh I
 
02:17:37.309 --> 02:17:37.319 align:start position:0%
didn't find out till almost a year later
 
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
um and after that all going on behind my
 
02:17:42.990 --> 02:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
back without my knowledge there's a
 
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.270 align:start position:0%
back without my knowledge there's a
misconduct

02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
misconduct
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
investigation uh that's dated February
 
02:17:48.599 --> 02:17:50.110 align:start position:0%
investigation uh that's dated February
16th

02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
16th
 
02:17:52.669 --> 02:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
2021 where the judicial conduct
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
committee voted to dismiss this report
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
for the lack of any showing of judicial
 
02:17:59.150 --> 02:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
misconduct with no reasonable likelihood
 
02:18:01.030 --> 02:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
of a finding of judicial
 
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
misconduct again a copy to judge king
 
02:18:09.709 --> 02:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
so you know November to February judge
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
king knows all about the falsification
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
of the record he knows all about the
 
02:18:17.349 --> 02:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
misconduct uh I have no clue I even know
 
02:18:17.359 --> 02:18:18.509 align:start position:0%
misconduct uh I have no clue I even know
that

02:18:18.509 --> 02:18:18.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
happened you know by the time this
 
02:18:24.349 --> 02:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
letter uh the only way I found out was a
 
02:18:27.230 --> 02:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
proactive Discovery request essentially
 
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
a fishing expedition to The JCC for
 
02:18:31.469 --> 02:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
reports of
 
02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
misconduct seems like someone maybe
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
me and uh again this is all a hearing
 
02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
where we're supposed to be going over
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
these DCF and uh
 
02:18:49.439 --> 02:18:51.589 align:start position:0%
these DCF and uh
DCFS

02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
DCFS
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
records uh the other handout I would
 
02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
draw that's the last kind of one
 
02:18:59.549 --> 02:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
pager these are
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
double-sided uh an email from the judge
 
02:19:05.309 --> 02:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
in the case who signed the orders based
 
02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
on this hearing that she
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
knows nothing about my
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
case she says she suspects I was a
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
cosigner no recollection of you
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
personally no
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
facts um she claimed she didn't make
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
order substantively well what does that
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
mean so we kind of went through a whole
 
02:19:34.349 --> 02:19:34.359 align:start position:0%
hearing on LA on DCF records and from
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
two different
 
02:19:37.870 --> 02:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
states with a
 
02:19:41.230 --> 02:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
judge who was out uh excuse me a marital
 
02:19:43.509 --> 02:19:43.519 align:start position:0%
master who was out to lunch a judge who
 
02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
knows nothing about the case and I kind
 
02:19:48.509 --> 02:19:48.519 align:start position:0%
of suspect
 
02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
nobody ever read these what's probably
 
02:19:53.630 --> 02:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
most concerning to me
 
02:19:57.790 --> 02:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
though is if you look at the last sort
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
of number five that's the only one
 
02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:00.270 align:start position:0%
of number five that's the only one
that's

02:20:00.270 --> 02:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:01.990 align:start position:0%
that's
stapled

02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
stapled
 
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh the pages are in the page numbers are
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the upper right hand
 
02:20:10.830 --> 02:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
corner uh it's
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
page 26 we don't have the whole thing a
 
02:20:17.790 --> 02:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
large portion of this has been redacted
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
I've been unable to get a complete
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
copy uh so that's a discovery
 
02:20:28.510 --> 02:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
issue but on page 16 and it is again
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
highlighted in yellow sort of the most
 
02:20:31.439 --> 02:20:33.230 align:start position:0%
highlighted in yellow sort of the most
relevant

02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
part uh or excuse me page 26 lines 12-
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
16 judge king is questioned under oath
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
if he told the judicial conduct
 
02:20:46.110 --> 02:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
committee and he asks did I tell the
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
judicial conduct committee
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
what uh and he's asked again about what
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
you had found regarding the transcript
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
in the Au case so this comes back to the
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
record and he says yes so he said under
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
oath that he told the judicial conduct
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee about the
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
transcript well if he told the judicial
 
02:21:12.349 --> 02:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
conduct committee about the
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
transcript then why did they dismiss the
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
complaint on February 16th
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
2021 so it is my belief that the chief
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
administrative judge again my belief
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
that the chief administrative judge lied
 
02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
under oath in his deposition concerning
 
02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
falsification of the court record in my
 
02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
case and this is a very serious
 
02:21:48.429 --> 02:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
matter because what was before the court
 
02:21:51.309 --> 02:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know our motions to modify you
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
know who's doing well with the kids and
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
agencies and as a result of that my case
 
02:22:02.590 --> 02:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
has been delayed for
 
02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
years I have not seen my younger
 
02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:08.590 align:start position:0%
years I have not seen my younger
daughters

02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
daughters
 
02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:15.870 --> 02:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
years uh even though my oldest adult son
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
is home has lived with me for years
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
because he wasn't
 
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
involved and you know they sort of moved
 
02:22:27.790 --> 02:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
all over the country and we
 
02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
um I think nobody can track that down
 
02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
and just to kind of end on something
 
02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
somebody said
 
02:22:40.990 --> 02:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
earlier uh there was a claim they nobody
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at their case well I
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
think the state wants to get rid of my
 
02:22:49.630 --> 02:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.270 --> 02:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
you know as you move forward we call a
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
three-hour supon hearing not at the
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
grest of either party to for the judge
 
02:23:02.349 --> 02:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
to decide that New Hampshire shouldn't
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction at all over
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
parenting uh when both
 
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
parties uh nobody asked for that both
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
parties were happy to have New Hampshire
 
02:23:15.070 --> 02:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
retain jurisdiction but at the same time
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire gets to retain
 
02:23:19.269 --> 02:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over civil domestic
 
02:23:19.279 --> 02:23:20.590 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over civil domestic
violence

02:23:20.590 --> 02:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
violence
 
02:23:23.550 --> 02:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
allegations and uh I guess those are
 
02:23:26.590 --> 02:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
more profitable than taking care of kids
 
02:23:30.429 --> 02:23:30.439 align:start position:0%
for the state thank you thank you any
 
02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
kofalt uh thank you uh Madam chair thank
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so one of the
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
handouts that you provided
 
02:23:47.070 --> 02:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
was an email from Julie introcaso at
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
email on the back of that it is
 
02:23:51.309 --> 02:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
highlighted there's a statement I
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
suspect I was a co-signer I believe
 
02:23:57.469 --> 02:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
you referenced this briefly in your
 
02:23:59.550 --> 02:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
testimony can you explain a little bit
 
02:24:02.910 --> 02:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
more and sort of go into what you mean
 
02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
by that statement or what you interpret
 
02:24:11.590 --> 02:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
that statement to me uh a absolutely so
 
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire our constitution
 
02:24:17.550 --> 02:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
provides for judges
 
02:24:20.750 --> 02:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
who take Oaths and have the ability to
 
02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:23.110 align:start position:0%
who take Oaths and have the ability to
issue

02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
orders uh at the time she was
 
02:24:30.830 --> 02:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
responsible for my case uh Julian tasso
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
was the judge signing
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
orders also involved in my case hearing
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
it was marital master Bruce dpra and
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's a marital
 
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
master and the difference is uh they're
 
02:24:49.510 --> 02:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
not a judge for the
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I would refer the
 
02:24:56.670 --> 02:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
committee to uh wit the justices of the
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
Superior Court uh from the First Circuit
 
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
Court of
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
Appeals uh it's a three-page decision I
 
02:25:06.670 --> 02:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
can email it to you but it essentially
 
02:25:09.790 --> 02:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
says that Masters have no inherent power
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
and derive all their Authority from the
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
judge uh so when she says she suspects
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
she was a
 
02:25:20.429 --> 02:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
co-signer I think
 
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
she's trying to get out of having any
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility for my case when she's
 
02:25:29.790 --> 02:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.590 --> 02:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:38.030 --> 02:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted so it am I interpreting this
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
correctly then when I so she says she
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
has no recollection of the case you know
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
people I'm sure people are busy they
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
they cover a lot of cases but I guess
 
02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
that what concerns me is that following
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
statement a decision that I did not make
 
02:25:53.760 --> 02:25:55.510 align:start position:0%
statement a decision that I did not make
substantively

02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
substantively
 
02:25:58.269 --> 02:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
um that's very concerning to me too I
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what that means okay I would
 
02:26:05.710 --> 02:26:05.720 align:start position:0%
also in her uh deposit deposition dated
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
February 8th Julian tasso's
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
deposition uh she also discusses my case
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
under oath where she says she has no
 
02:26:17.590 --> 02:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
recollection but knows that it's a
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
notorious case so if she's going to say
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's a notorious case how does she have
 
02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
it's a notorious case how does she have
no

02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
recollection I have a question yes
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
um so when
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
you ended up going who originally
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
petitioned was there a dcyf
 
02:26:45.070 --> 02:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
petition um against one of you you or
 
02:26:50.269 --> 02:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
your ex uh no so the brief procedural
 
02:26:53.950 --> 02:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
background my case started with false
 
02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
allegations of domestic violence against
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
me civil by the other
 
02:27:03.469 --> 02:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
party uh those are often
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
weaponized uh and used as a silver
 
02:27:08.830 --> 02:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
bullet in many cases to gain an
 
02:27:12.349 --> 02:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
immediate upper hand again often
 
02:27:12.359 --> 02:27:14.990 align:start position:0%
immediate upper hand again often
used

02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
um those were
 
02:27:20.590 --> 02:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
missed uh as soon as those were
 
02:27:23.309 --> 02:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
dismissed the other party's next attempt
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
to essentially use agencies in the
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
system as a weapon with then to file
 
02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
DCF uh thank you yeah and when they when
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
you were contacted by DCF did they give
 
02:27:44.190 --> 02:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
you information on what your rights were
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
regarding due
 
02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:47.910 align:start position:0%
regarding due
process

02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
they did not uh or they excuse me they
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
might have let me just say I don't
 
02:27:58.910 --> 02:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
recall exactly what the handout
 
02:28:04.190 --> 02:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
said um I do recall telling them that uh
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to speak with them what
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
I wanted my attorney
 
02:28:12.150 --> 02:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.349 --> 02:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you that's very helpful and
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
to go a little further with the DCF
 
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the proceedings so you said
 
02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
you were willing to speak with them with
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
your attorney present and uh was a DCF
 
02:28:32.349 --> 02:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
case ever brought or were they simply
 
02:28:35.269 --> 02:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
involved because of the complaint or
 
02:28:36.830 --> 02:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
could you explain to us a little bit
 
02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
about what happened with DCF because
 
02:28:40.990 --> 02:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
that's specifically what we're looking
 
02:28:44.349 --> 02:28:44.359 align:start position:0%
into okay and if I could share with just
 
02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
both the agencies because they
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
both informative uh I understand that
 
02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
but we're looking into New Hampshire DCF
 
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
so if you could right if if the other's
 
02:28:58.590 --> 02:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
necessary for our understanding that's
 
02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
great if you could let us know about the
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings with DCF that would be very
 
02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
helpful so uh New Hampshire
 
02:29:12.550 --> 02:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
DCF uh she made one call that was uh
 
02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:13.710 align:start position:0%
DCF uh she made one call that was uh
completely

02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
dismissed uh they didn't take it
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
DCF uh the uh it then her allegations
 
02:29:26.990 --> 02:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
were then reported through her therapist
 
02:29:29.269 --> 02:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
as a mandated reporter so that was
 
02:29:32.550 --> 02:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
enough to actually get something
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
open uh I believe neighbors also
 
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
reported allegations against her in that
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
complaint uh and so you basically have
 
02:29:48.870 --> 02:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
an invest investigation opened uh
 
02:29:51.150 --> 02:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
against both parties because people are
 
02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:53.269 align:start position:0%
against both parties because people are
calling

02:29:53.269 --> 02:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
calling
 
02:29:53.279 --> 02:29:55.030 align:start position:0%
calling
them

02:29:55.030 --> 02:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
and um well that's not enough for DCF to
 
02:30:01.269 --> 02:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
take action that's certainly enough to
 
02:30:03.269 --> 02:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
produce a report of who said what to
 
02:30:05.269 --> 02:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
where that should be admissible in a
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
family court proceeding you know that a
 
02:30:12.349 --> 02:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
judge uh would want to look at to kind
 
02:30:14.349 --> 02:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
of help figure out what's going on in
 
02:30:14.359 --> 02:30:15.110 align:start position:0%
of help figure out what's going on in
the

02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
case and I could say the same
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
essentially for L uh the Los Angeles
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
agency again that's initiated by the
 
02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
parties but then the report should come
 
02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:29.349 align:start position:0%
parties but then the report should come
into

02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
evidence and just to be completely clear
 
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh so there never was an although there
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
was a dcyf investigation because of all
 
02:30:40.590 --> 02:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
of those
 
02:30:43.510 --> 02:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
reports is it am I correct in thinking
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
that no dcyf proceeding was ever filed
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
in court uh yes you were correct no
 
02:30:54.349 --> 02:30:54.359 align:start position:0%
proing is ever filed okay I just wanted
 
02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
to be sure I understood what dcf's
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
much if no one else has questions I have
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
a couple sure so when you
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
were um when DCF made contact with you
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
and did their part of the investigation
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
um concerning
 
02:31:17.790 --> 02:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
you um they gave you a a brochure you
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
said um and did they do a home visit did
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
they uh interview your
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
kids how did that all go uh so my kids
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
are not with me uh in my
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
home uh I told them I didn't want to
 
02:31:40.510 --> 02:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
speak without my attorney present my
 
02:31:43.269 --> 02:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
attorney advised me to set up an
 
02:31:45.790 --> 02:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
appointment with them in my home with
 
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
him present
 
02:31:51.790 --> 02:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
and so uh my attorney and the social
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
worker and myself had a three-way
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
conversation at my dining room table per
 
02:31:58.750 --> 02:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
the advice of my
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
Council thank you
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
and um did you feel that the report that
 
02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
DCF issued
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
reflected um accurately what occurred at
 
02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
that uh during that
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
conversation uh yes but I did have uh I
 
02:32:22.349 --> 02:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
would consider unnecessarily delays in
 
02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:31.630 --> 02:32:31.640 align:start position:0%
it uh what kind of delays how how are
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
you delayed just I mean if you ask the
 
02:32:39.070 --> 02:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
agency with report because your attorney
 
02:32:41.309 --> 02:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
wants it as evidence in a family law
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
case and this goes for you know
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
California as well then both agencies
 
02:32:50.349 --> 02:32:50.359 align:start position:0%
should be providing a copy in a timely
 
02:32:55.309 --> 02:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:58.469 --> 02:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
later thank
 
02:32:58.479 --> 02:33:00.349 align:start position:0%
later thank
you

02:33:00.349 --> 02:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:33:04.710 --> 02:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
and when so did they did the court just
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
refuse to consider the reports as
 
02:33:13.269 --> 02:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
evidence uh I would have to go back uh
 
02:33:15.630 --> 02:33:15.640 align:start position:0%
they were admitted I believe I would
 
02:33:17.790 --> 02:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
have to go back and review the
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
transcript uh there're
 
02:33:23.070 --> 02:33:23.080 align:start position:0%

I apologize all right our

02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
baton do you swear that the testimony
 
02:36:32.349 --> 02:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
you're about to provide will be the
 
02:36:33.630 --> 02:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
truth the whole truth and nothing but
 
02:36:43.150 --> 02:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:46.150 --> 02:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
you so my intention with today to's
 
02:36:48.190 --> 02:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and the written testimony that
 
02:36:50.429 --> 02:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
will follow is to use provable
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental truth to help paint a
 
02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
picture for you to help shine some light
 
02:36:57.670 --> 02:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
into the darkness of unlawful practices
 
02:37:00.309 --> 02:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
that had been hidden from the people for
 
02:37:02.910 --> 02:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
decades with the understanding that due
 
02:37:05.950 --> 02:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
process like all law in the state must
 
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
be viewed using fundamental principles
 
02:37:09.990 --> 02:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
that are not changed by time or
 
02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.990 align:start position:0%
that are not changed by time or
political

02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
political
 
02:37:14.590 --> 02:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
ambition before I dive in I suspect I'm
 
02:37:16.710 --> 02:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
going to get some push back from people
 
02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
who teach legal Theory contrary to what
 
02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
I'm going to
 
02:37:22.710 --> 02:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
say they might tell you that you have to
 
02:37:24.830 --> 02:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
look at due process through the lens of
 
02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
procedure through precedent and
 
02:37:29.389 --> 02:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
statute some of them might even have the
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
nerve to say that the people gave up
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
some of their due process rights when
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
they formed the
 
02:37:37.110 --> 02:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
state that so-called case law is in fact
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
the law and they may call my statements
 
02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
Antiquated or
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
irrelevant but just as you asked us
 
02:37:46.030 --> 02:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
today which I commend you for by the way
 
02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
way you should demand that those people
 
02:37:50.790 --> 02:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
support their claims in writing make it
 
02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
clear not as Theory both
 
02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:54.750 align:start position:0%
clear not as Theory both
incontrovertible

02:37:54.750 --> 02:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
incontrovertible
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
fact ask them if they are willing to
 
02:37:58.349 --> 02:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
support their claims on oath under
 
02:38:00.670 --> 02:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
penalty of
 
02:38:02.590 --> 02:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
perjury now because there are many
 
02:38:04.590 --> 02:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about what the con
 
02:38:06.429 --> 02:38:06.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution is I'm going to offer a
 
02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
point of clarity from the New Hampshire
 
02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court who said in its westerby
 
02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:11.389 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court who said in its westerby
Plymouth

02:38:11.389 --> 02:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
Plymouth
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
decision the division of the
 
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution into two parts was not made
 
02:38:18.750 --> 02:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
without a purpose and the name of each
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
part is not without
 
02:38:22.269 --> 02:38:22.279 align:start position:0%
significance the first is a Bill of
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
Rights and the second is a form of
 
02:38:26.910 --> 02:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
government the second in general is a
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
grant of powers made by the people to
 
02:38:31.150 --> 02:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
magistrates and officers of government
 
02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
who are declared in part one to be the
 
02:38:34.510 --> 02:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
grant tour's
 
02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
agents and the first part contains a
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
list of Rights not surrendered by the
 
02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
people when they form themselves into a
 
02:38:44.590 --> 02:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
state by the reservation of these they
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
limit the powers granted in the second
 
02:38:49.389 --> 02:38:49.399 align:start position:0%
part they Exempted themselves to the
 
02:38:51.870 --> 02:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
stipulated extent from the authority of
 
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
the government they created end
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
quote now some people don't think of the
 
02:38:59.230 --> 02:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution as the law but that's
 
02:39:02.190 --> 02:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is it even says So
 
02:39:03.510 --> 02:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
within its own
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
Pages part two article 101 says that the
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
constitution is with the law of the land
 
02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
and is to be written into every law book
 
02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:13.030 align:start position:0%
and is to be written into every law book
for

02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:39:15.309 --> 02:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
perpetuity so both in theory and in
 
02:39:17.510 --> 02:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
practice the fundamental law of our
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
state the law that created your office
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
which you all promis to support in
 
02:39:24.910 --> 02:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
advance of taking your seat is clear
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
that the legislature cannot lawfully
 
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
interfere with the rights of the people
 
02:39:31.510 --> 02:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
for any reason
 
02:39:33.309 --> 02:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
whatsoever now having laid that
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
Foundation we can move on to due process
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
with just two points of
 
02:39:40.150 --> 02:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
clarity the founders I suggest knew that
 
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
there would be times when evil would
 
02:39:44.269 --> 02:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
rear its ugly head they were not
 
02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
strangers to despotic tyranical
 
02:39:49.269 --> 02:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
government they were also well studied
 
02:39:51.630 --> 02:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
in history and law and they understood
 
02:39:51.640 --> 02:39:52.990 align:start position:0%
in history and law and they understood
human

02:39:52.990 --> 02:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
human
 
02:39:55.309 --> 02:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
nature so they made provision in the
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
constitution in an effort to correct uh
 
02:40:01.150 --> 02:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
to protect the body politic and its
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
citizens but only under very specific
 
02:40:06.910 --> 02:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
conditions to allow for the taking of
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
Rights my following Point must not be
 
02:40:12.750 --> 02:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
overlooked regarding due process and
 
02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
courts there are two classifications of
 
02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:16.429 align:start position:0%
courts there are two classifications of
Courts

02:40:16.429 --> 02:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
Courts
 
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
courts of record and courts not of
 
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
record a court of record is the only
 
02:40:24.510 --> 02:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
lawful recourse sanctioned by the
 
02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution for the state to take life
 
02:40:31.389 --> 02:40:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:33.710 --> 02:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
people now the definitions of terms in
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
the law dictionaries and the way that
 
02:40:36.910 --> 02:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
they've been taught at law schools have
 
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
been changed but the changing of the
 
02:40:41.469 --> 02:40:41.479 align:start position:0%
definitions does not change the meaning
 
02:40:43.469 --> 02:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
of the words at the time they were
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
written now scotus has recently affirmed
 
02:40:47.950 --> 02:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
that statement and the Fallout of which
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
is Rippling throughout the court system
 
02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
around in the all over the nation even
 
02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
as we
 
02:40:55.469 --> 02:40:55.479 align:start position:0%
speak a court of record at the time the
 
02:40:58.110 --> 02:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
Constitutions were written has five
 
02:41:00.269 --> 02:41:00.279 align:start position:0%
attributes that distinguish it from a
 
02:41:03.550 --> 02:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
court not of record um a court of record
 
02:41:05.469 --> 02:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
exercises functions independent of the
 
02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
magistrate meaning the judge who who
 
02:41:10.150 --> 02:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
works it is paid independently of the
 
02:41:13.990 --> 02:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
agency people and Council before it it
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
has records and proceedings that are
 
02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
open to the public so no sealed records
 
02:41:19.230 --> 02:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
no closed
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
courtrooms it proceeds by the common law
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
not by
 
02:41:25.550 --> 02:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
Statute and unlike courts of record
 
02:41:27.790 --> 02:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
sorry unlike courts not of record courts
 
02:41:30.670 --> 02:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
of record do have the power to fine or
 
02:41:33.309 --> 02:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
imprison inste another way they have the
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
power to deprive of life liberty and
 
02:41:37.389 --> 02:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
property and fifth they generally
 
02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
possess a seal now legislative tribunals
 
02:41:43.950 --> 02:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
on the other hand of which DCF a DCF
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
court is one
 
02:41:48.670 --> 02:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
they do not operate independent of the
 
02:41:51.070 --> 02:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
magistrate the magistrate is directed by
 
02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
rules of and is paid by the agency
 
02:41:56.429 --> 02:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
working in front of councel also paid by
 
02:41:56.439 --> 02:41:57.309 align:start position:0%
working in front of councel also paid by
the

02:41:57.309 --> 02:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:59.710 --> 02:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
agency they do not proceed by the course
 
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
of common law they proceed by
 
02:42:04.750 --> 02:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
Statute their proceedings are private
 
02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
their records are often sealed they're
 
02:42:09.389 --> 02:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
not open to the public and legislative
 
02:42:11.950 --> 02:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
tribunals by definition are not courts
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
of record and therefore hold no power to
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
fine or imprison
 
02:42:17.870 --> 02:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
which means they have no authority to
 
02:42:20.670 --> 02:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
deprive the people of their life liberty
 
02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:21.590 align:start position:0%
deprive the people of their life liberty
or

02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:42:23.790 --> 02:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
property now I don't want you to take my
 
02:42:24.950 --> 02:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
word for
 
02:42:27.190 --> 02:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
this you can look for these fundamental
 
02:42:29.950 --> 02:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
principles yourself and if the truth is
 
02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
what you seek you will find plenty of
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
support for what I'm
 
02:42:36.110 --> 02:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
saying one of the features of a court of
 
02:42:37.710 --> 02:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
record that I want to clarify a little
 
02:42:39.910 --> 02:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
bit further is that it must proed by the
 
02:42:42.349 --> 02:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
common law and the reason I have to
 
02:42:43.870 --> 02:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
bring this to your attention here is
 
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
because teaching about the common law is
 
02:42:49.389 --> 02:42:49.399 align:start position:0%
mostly factually
 
02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:51.560 align:start position:0%
incorrect people teaching you might tell
 
02:42:53.710 --> 02:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
you that so-called case law has changed
 
02:42:56.910 --> 02:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
or even built upon the common law or
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
that case precedent is itself common law
 
02:43:01.790 --> 02:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
but those claims are simply not
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
true and are another example of
 
02:43:06.670 --> 02:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
something that has been hidden from the
 
02:43:09.190 --> 02:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
people the common law is precisely that
 
02:43:11.190 --> 02:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
which is distinguished from from law
 
02:43:12.590 --> 02:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
that is created by
 
02:43:16.469 --> 02:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
legislators it is a fixed and IM able
 
02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
Authority and since the Judiciary does
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%
not make law so-call case law is a myth
 
02:43:22.399 --> 02:43:24.510 align:start position:0%
not make law so-call case law is a myth
at

02:43:24.510 --> 02:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
best the common law is not some
 
02:43:29.309 --> 02:43:29.319 align:start position:0%
Antiquated legal Theory nor is it
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
difficult to understand it is common in
 
02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
that it is common to all and that it is
 
02:43:35.590 --> 02:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
easy to
 
02:43:37.630 --> 02:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
understand and I will provide you with a
 
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
written testimony at a later date and
 
02:43:41.710 --> 02:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to make more statements
 
02:43:44.110 --> 02:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
under oath to support my claims but if
 
02:43:45.710 --> 02:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
you research this for yourself and find
 
02:43:47.230 --> 02:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
it to be
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
true then I need to ask you does the
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislature have any Authority
 
02:43:54.030 --> 02:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
whatsoever to create an agency or
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
tribunal to take a child from a parent
 
02:43:59.830 --> 02:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
if that Tri tribunal is not open to the
 
02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
public and has a magistrate who's not
 
02:44:06.269 --> 02:44:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:08.070 --> 02:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
proceeding I'm sure you know my answer
 
02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
to the question is that they do not and
 
02:44:12.750 --> 02:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
no matter of expediency or convenience
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
can make it
 
02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
so again I don't want you to take my
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
word for it look for yourself and ask
 
02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
how do you know the answer to a
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
question the truth of the matter is
 
02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
available to you if you want to find it
 
02:44:27.710 --> 02:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
and as agents of the people it is your
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
so Madam chair I'm just going to
 
02:44:36.110 --> 02:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
apologize to my root for my rudness but
 
02:44:37.790 --> 02:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
I had no idea that we were going to
 
02:44:39.389 --> 02:44:39.399 align:start position:0%
proceed this long so I'm going to have
 
02:44:42.550 --> 02:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
to leave and um assure people that I
 
02:44:44.230 --> 02:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
will look very carefully at the tapes
 
02:44:46.590 --> 02:44:46.600 align:start position:0%
going forward thank you representative
 
02:44:49.710 --> 02:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
wever um thank you for your testimony um
 
02:44:52.469 --> 02:44:52.479 align:start position:0%
I have a question you were saying the
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
definition is in Black's
 
02:44:59.070 --> 02:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
Law fourth and I actually sent out that
 
02:45:01.710 --> 02:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
uh definition from that um to the
 
02:45:04.830 --> 02:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
members of this committee today um of
 
02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
due process and and it does allude to if
 
02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
I can find it to common law um that's
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
this one with the notes which I didn't
 
02:45:15.630 --> 02:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
mean to include my comments but I was
 
02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
breaking down the definition and trying
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
to really parse it out to figure out
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
what it meant and um so this is helpful
 
02:45:26.710 --> 02:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
so in the definition you were talking
 
02:45:29.070 --> 02:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
about common law and it's my
 
02:45:30.830 --> 02:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
understanding that when it's referring
 
02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
to maxims that that's referring to
 
02:45:35.070 --> 02:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
that's part of the common law am I
 
02:45:36.790 --> 02:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
correct in that
 
02:45:40.349 --> 02:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
understanding um well point of clarity
 
02:45:41.469 --> 02:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
is that I didn't I didn't bring up
 
02:45:44.110 --> 02:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
Black's Law Dictionary at all I don't
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
believe I said that anywhere in my my
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
statement um but um I'm familiar with
 
02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
Black's Law and I don't I don't have the
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
definition written in front of me so
 
02:45:55.790 --> 02:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
maybe it
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
was Mr he um okay mentioned Black's Law
 
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
I mean look many things that I have here
 
02:46:05.389 --> 02:46:05.399 align:start position:0%
are supported in Black Law sure okay so
 
02:46:07.429 --> 02:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
what I'm sorry what's your question um I
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
was just wanted um some understanding of
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
what maxims are exactly um it I I know
 
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
what they are yeah um so they're
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
basically the law that guides law right
 
02:46:22.429 --> 02:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
they're the fundamental principles that
 
02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
are that underpin this legal system
 
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
would that be correct yes um they're the
 
02:46:31.870 --> 02:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
foundational principles of all law
 
02:46:34.429 --> 02:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation okay and so does
 
02:46:37.510 --> 02:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
common law include it includes those and
 
02:46:41.950 --> 02:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
then and case precedent though right no
 
02:46:43.990 --> 02:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
no if you read uh if you read the
 
02:46:46.230 --> 02:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
definition carefully case precedent is
 
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
is exactly precluded from the
 
02:46:49.800 --> 02:46:52.630 align:start position:0%
is exactly precluded from the
definition

02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:46:54.510 --> 02:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
okay you do have to read it very
 
02:46:56.950 --> 02:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
carefully it's it's a tricky sentence
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
and I I know that um attorneys will read
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
the first half of the sentence and tell
 
02:47:02.269 --> 02:47:02.279 align:start position:0%
you that case precedent is part of the
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
common law but if you read the whole
 
02:47:07.230 --> 02:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
sentence it's very clear that it is
 
02:47:10.110 --> 02:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
not okay and I'm happy to provide
 
02:47:12.349 --> 02:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
written testimony to support that
 
02:47:15.710 --> 02:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
statement so as far as DCF and family
 
02:47:18.750 --> 02:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
court goes do you know if those courts
 
02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
move under that if that's how they
 
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
operate as legislative tribunals um
 
02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's how they
 
02:47:30.110 --> 02:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
operate okay they do not have a
 
02:47:32.990 --> 02:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
magistrate that is independent of the
 
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
proceeding and they are often sealed
 
02:47:39.230 --> 02:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
right what were the five points that I
 
02:47:43.309 --> 02:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
made well I mean in D not just inside
 
02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
DCF but the family court has
 
02:47:49.469 --> 02:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
judges and it
 
02:47:53.269 --> 02:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
has um it has rules in place to protect
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
due process um although we're hearing
 
02:47:58.110 --> 02:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
that there might be some places where
 
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
those can be fixed so can you um can you
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
just help me
 
02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
understand how I mean is it a problem
 
02:48:10.990 --> 02:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
not only within DCF itself or is it also
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
an issue with how cases are handled
 
02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
within the family court
 
02:48:17.670 --> 02:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
that handles those I'm not here to speak
 
02:48:19.990 --> 02:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
to Family Court I'm here to tell you
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
what due process is through the lens of
 
02:48:24.190 --> 02:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
the Constitution at the time that it was
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
written and what a court of record is
 
02:48:28.750 --> 02:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
versus what a court not of record is and
 
02:48:30.590 --> 02:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
if you're going to take rights away from
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
people it has to be in a court of
 
02:48:36.630 --> 02:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
record and the DCF court is not a court
 
02:48:38.910 --> 02:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
of record that's very helpful thank you
 
02:48:40.910 --> 02:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
for that clarification representative
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
kofalt U thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so one of
 
02:48:46.710 --> 02:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
your statements uh about courts of
 
02:48:50.269 --> 02:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
record was that a court of record is to
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
render decisions based and and I believe
 
02:48:55.950 --> 02:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
that the exact quote was based on common
 
02:48:59.790 --> 02:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
law not on statute or
 
02:49:02.590 --> 02:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
precedent hopefully I'm close if not
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
spot can you can you clarify the not on
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
statute part because that one is a
 
02:49:12.030 --> 02:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing to me is it common
 
02:49:16.550 --> 02:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
law um supersede statute or is it not on
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
statute as you sort of should I take
 
02:49:20.590 --> 02:49:20.600 align:start position:0%
your statement
 
02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:22.110 align:start position:0%
your statement
literally

02:49:22.110 --> 02:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
literally
 
02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
um could you rephrase the question for
 
02:49:33.389 --> 02:49:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:36.750 --> 02:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
so a court of record
 
02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
is is to follow the Constitution and
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
common law I I'm with you up to that
 
02:49:47.389 --> 02:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
point I also understand the what you've
 
02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
presented in terms of precedent and I
 
02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
will go look at that for myself to to to
 
02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
02:49:57.150 --> 02:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
better it's that you said not you know
 
02:49:57.160 --> 02:49:58.510 align:start position:0%
better it's that you said not you know
not

02:49:58.510 --> 02:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:50:01.150 --> 02:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
on statute or
 
02:50:04.389 --> 02:50:04.399 align:start position:0%
precedent I I think I'm misinterpreting
 
02:50:06.190 --> 02:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
what you said because to me that sounds
 
02:50:08.309 --> 02:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
like you're saying that courts of record
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
should not consider Statute in rendering
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
their decisions at all did I
 
02:50:17.150 --> 02:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
misunderstand that um I'm not going to
 
02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
comment only because I don't want him to
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
speak any further question thank you for
 
02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:27.160 align:start position:0%

you my testimony today is on behalf of
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
Dian and Cody who three of us who are

still in the room heard uh give
 
02:51:10.950 --> 02:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
testimony to a bill that directly
 
02:51:13.429 --> 02:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
affected her case and she lives in
 
02:51:16.349 --> 02:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
Illinois and that's why she's not here
 
02:51:21.750 --> 02:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:25.710 --> 02:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
behalf her great niece adelyn jeremia
 
02:51:28.710 --> 02:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
died of cute fentanyl poisoning in
 
02:51:30.269 --> 02:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
November of
 
02:51:33.710 --> 02:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
2020 her parents were doing drugs she
 
02:51:36.229 --> 02:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
was left alone in the car with her older
 
02:51:40.469 --> 02:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
sister and she ingested it and
 
02:51:43.870 --> 02:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
died family members had made multiple
 
02:51:47.269 --> 02:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
calls to to DCF because they were aware
 
02:51:51.150 --> 02:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
that the parents were doing drugs DCF
 
02:51:54.830 --> 02:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
over several months refused to intervene
 
02:51:58.790 --> 02:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
so her name was already known to
 
02:52:03.550 --> 02:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
them uh when she found out a few months
 
02:52:07.910 --> 02:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
later when uh alen's mother who was her
 
02:52:11.429 --> 02:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
niece contacted her and said I'm
 
02:52:14.550 --> 02:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
pregnant she had kept it a secret and
 
02:52:18.910 --> 02:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
she asked her aunt if she would take uh
 
02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
take care of her two
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
children uh she found that so it wasn't
 
02:52:27.790 --> 02:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
until I received a call in January that
 
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
she had given birth to a boy asked him
 
02:52:33.309 --> 02:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
asked her if she would raise him so it
 
02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
was 10 days after his birth when she was
 
02:52:39.710 --> 02:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
called she responded automatically that
 
02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
she would so she had uh told DC the the
 
02:52:47.590 --> 02:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
mother had told DCF who she had asked
 
02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
and given them her name and but DCF
 
02:52:54.910 --> 02:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
never ever called
 
02:52:54.920 --> 02:52:56.590 align:start position:0%
never ever called
Diane

02:52:56.590 --> 02:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
Diane
 
02:53:02.429 --> 02:53:02.439 align:start position:0%
uh this their DCF policy manual 1,600
 
02:53:02.439 --> 02:53:04.150 align:start position:0%
uh this their DCF policy manual 1,600
placement

02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
placement
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
considerations uh would have directed
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
them to try to place him with a family
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
member but uh she when when she
 
02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
contacted now I'm trying trying to
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
paraphrase this and not doing a very
 
02:53:22.389 --> 02:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
good job uh she the day after she
 
02:53:25.150 --> 02:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
learned the baby was born Diane stated
 
02:53:27.870 --> 02:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
she'd be there in 24 hours she has her
 
02:53:32.150 --> 02:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
own business as a real estate person uh
 
02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
she he was not out of care of his mother
 
02:53:37.269 --> 02:53:37.279 align:start position:0%
at the time so she was traveling from
 
02:53:39.469 --> 02:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
Illinois they asked me personal
 
02:53:41.070 --> 02:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
questions about my background in
 
02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
criminal history she gave them
 
02:53:44.830 --> 02:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
everything so they could do a criminal
 
02:53:48.309 --> 02:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
check they never responded to her she
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
made multiple calls to reach them and
 
02:53:54.229 --> 02:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
when she finally did DCF informed her
 
02:53:56.429 --> 02:53:56.439 align:start position:0%
she was not an option because she didn't
 
02:53:59.750 --> 02:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire and if I relocated
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire they would engage me in
 
02:54:06.910 --> 02:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
the placement process so she did in my
 
02:54:09.229 --> 02:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
opinion that's a pretty massive move and
 
02:54:12.190 --> 02:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
shows great intent to take care of the
 
02:54:15.309 --> 02:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
kids diyan hired in the attorney and
 
02:54:19.309 --> 02:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
file for guardianship DCF informed her
 
02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
that she could not file for guardianship
 
02:54:24.229 --> 02:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
as they had him in their custody and
 
02:54:26.550 --> 02:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
169c guardianship was not an
 
02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
option but RCA but RSA 169c defines
 
02:54:37.590 --> 02:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
custody and guardianship separately
 
02:54:40.229 --> 02:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
which we had to argue in court against
 
02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
DCF and unfortunately the Supreme Court
 
02:54:44.830 --> 02:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
gave them
 
02:54:47.550 --> 02:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
the argument that guardianship can
 
02:54:51.229 --> 02:54:51.239 align:start position:0%
coexist alongside dcyf
 
02:54:54.349 --> 02:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
custody during the time when Diane
 
02:54:57.070 --> 02:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
initially contacted dcyf and told them
 
02:54:59.870 --> 02:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
she was ready willing and able to care
 
02:55:02.790 --> 02:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
for him and a month before The Supreme
 
02:55:06.229 --> 02:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
Court went I was living in New Hampshire
 
02:55:08.469 --> 02:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
jumping through the hoops and obstacles
 
02:55:11.870 --> 02:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
that DCF put in my path they were not
 
02:55:15.349 --> 02:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
allowing policies I was asking for
 
02:55:19.150 --> 02:55:19.160 align:start position:0%
explanations those are her words DCF
 
02:55:21.229 --> 02:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
limited my visitation with my great
 
02:55:24.550 --> 02:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
nephew and niece with no basis I went
 
02:55:26.790 --> 02:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
through the home study process for both
 
02:55:29.469 --> 02:55:29.479 align:start position:0%
children but she knew they wouldn't
 
02:55:31.750 --> 02:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
place them with her because she was
 
02:55:35.150 --> 02:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
already fighting with them in court for
 
02:55:37.630 --> 02:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
guardianship so she asked for an appeal
 
02:55:40.510 --> 02:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
of their placement decision Kasa was
 
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
involved Kasa never spoke to Diane once
 
02:55:46.269 --> 02:55:46.279 align:start position:0%
during the entire process it's supposed
 
02:55:48.349 --> 02:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
to be an independent party to advocate
 
02:55:50.830 --> 02:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
for children but Casa didn't follow
 
02:55:53.790 --> 02:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
their policies either one of which is to
 
02:55:55.590 --> 02:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
get to know all family members who have
 
02:55:59.150 --> 02:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
been involved in the children's lives
 
02:56:01.550 --> 02:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
she gave the office of child
 
02:56:04.349 --> 02:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
advocate uh to in to involve themselves
 
02:56:06.950 --> 02:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
multiple times during the dcf's
 
02:56:09.110 --> 02:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
retaliatory and punishing Behavior
 
02:56:13.070 --> 02:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
toward me the OCA had to intervene on my
 
02:56:15.309 --> 02:56:15.319 align:start position:0%
behalf more than
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
once we're Diane is still in litigation
 
02:56:21.389 --> 02:56:21.399 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm trying to be very
 
02:56:23.870 --> 02:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
careful to follow only what she has told
 
02:56:26.590 --> 02:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
me because they are still in
 
02:56:29.710 --> 02:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
litigation DCF is still fighting Diane
 
02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:32.910 align:start position:0%
litigation DCF is still fighting Diane
every

02:56:32.910 --> 02:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:35.590 --> 02:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
chance they didn't like that I won I'll
 
02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
read from her wordss I they didn't like
 
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
that I won at the Supreme Court then
 
02:56:44.429 --> 02:56:44.439 align:start position:0%
then the reason we three of us heard her
 
02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
testimony was because she became aware
 
02:56:50.070 --> 02:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
that uh a provision was put inside a
 
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
22-page legislative bill that would
 
02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
prevent anyone from obtaining
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
guardianship over a child in dcyf
 
02:57:00.229 --> 02:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
custody fortunately she heard about it
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
she flew here she testified late one
 
02:57:07.349 --> 02:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon and was told she had two
 
02:57:10.469 --> 02:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
minutes she luckily did talk more than
 
02:57:10.479 --> 02:57:11.469 align:start position:0%
minutes she luckily did talk more than
two

02:57:11.469 --> 02:57:11.479 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:57:14.070 --> 02:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
minutes she says she has been done
 
02:57:17.070 --> 02:57:17.080 align:start position:0%
confounded by the lengths and the money
 
02:57:20.990 --> 02:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
DCF has spent fighting her instead of
 
02:57:24.110 --> 02:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
working with her she couldn't understand
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
why they wouldn't want the assistance of
 
02:57:29.429 --> 02:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
a non-criminal wellestablished caring
 
02:57:32.349 --> 02:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
family member who their mother expressly
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
asked to care for her
 
02:57:36.750 --> 02:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
children but then she learned more about
 
02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
Child Protection Services as she got
 
02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:41.070 align:start position:0%

all the protective services which is an
 
02:57:50.990 --> 02:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
amalgamation of many services not one
 
02:57:52.870 --> 02:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
nice clean
 
02:57:54.830 --> 02:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
organization because of the cloak of
 
02:57:56.990 --> 02:57:57.000 align:start position:0%

guise of protecting the privacy of
 
02:58:02.269 --> 02:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
children in abuse and neglect the law
 
02:58:05.070 --> 02:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
makes it unlawful for Citizens involved
 
02:58:07.990 --> 02:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
to speak out to anyone regarding details
 
02:58:10.910 --> 02:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
and facts of what has occurred in their

family through the courts and dcyf
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
because they're threatened with fear and
 
02:58:20.070 --> 02:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
jail time and not seeing the kids I'll
 
02:58:20.080 --> 02:58:21.110 align:start position:0%
jail time and not seeing the kids I'll
add

02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
add
 
02:58:23.670 --> 02:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
that they use it to their advantage to
 
02:58:25.830 --> 02:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
block everyone from information making
 
02:58:28.950 --> 02:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
it inaccessible under the cloak of
 
02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
privacy she's also learned there's a
 
02:58:34.110 --> 02:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
complex web of funding from federal
 
02:58:36.830 --> 02:58:36.840 align:start position:0%

02:58:39.750 --> 02:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
accountable to a hodgepodge of
 
02:58:42.110 --> 02:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
authorities although the agencies are
 
02:58:45.429 --> 02:58:45.439 align:start position:0%

remained steady to ensure quote timely

to.org in in Diane's opinion DHHS and
 
03:00:15.229 --> 03:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
DCF do not make decisions based on
 
03:00:18.190 --> 03:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
what's best for the children they're
 
03:00:21.830 --> 03:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
making decisions on what's best for DHHS
 
03:00:24.190 --> 03:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
and the state of New Hampshire they're
 
03:00:26.510 --> 03:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
incentivized to keep children in the
 
03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
system and use their
 
03:00:32.830 --> 03:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
programs my great mother Diane says my
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
great nephew had a mother who expressed
 
03:00:39.269 --> 03:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
her direction for him to be in my care
 
03:00:43.309 --> 03:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
days after his birth yet DCF decided to
 
03:00:47.070 --> 03:00:47.080 align:start position:0%
go another route put him in the system a
 
03:00:50.110 --> 03:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
system he and his sister are still in
 
03:00:52.349 --> 03:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
three years
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
later thank you very much for the
 
03:00:57.349 --> 03:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
testimony on behalf of um Miss Cody who
 
03:01:00.110 --> 03:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here any questions from the
 
03:01:01.710 --> 03:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
03:01:03.750 --> 03:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee I have a question for you I
 
03:01:06.110 --> 03:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
know that you've been an advocate um for
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
people dealing with these issues for a
 
03:01:12.510 --> 03:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
while um are you aware are there any and
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we'll have the department here
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
at some point to to answer some
 
03:01:19.590 --> 03:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
questions too are you aware of training
 
03:01:22.670 --> 03:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
that goes on regarding due process
 
03:01:22.680 --> 03:01:24.590 align:start position:0%
that goes on regarding due process
within

03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
within
 
03:01:27.630 --> 03:01:27.640 align:start position:0%
DCF well I'm certainly not and that's
 
03:01:29.349 --> 03:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
you know that's not a statement that I
 
03:01:30.990 --> 03:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
know they don't get it you certainly
 
03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
could fair enough my my
 
03:01:33.359 --> 03:01:35.349 align:start position:0%
could fair enough my my
concern

03:01:35.349 --> 03:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:01:39.309 --> 03:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
that it makes me very sad that money
 
03:01:43.950 --> 03:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
talks so loud because if we look at how
 
03:01:48.590 --> 03:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
much money the state receives from
 
03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:49.910 align:start position:0%
much money the state receives from
congressional

03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
congressional
 
03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
acts that might turn people against us
 
03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
because they'll say oh we'll have to
 
03:01:58.830 --> 03:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
make up that many millions per
 
03:02:02.349 --> 03:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
year Well my argument is if you could
 
03:02:05.190 --> 03:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
get children out of the system you
 
03:02:07.790 --> 03:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be spending that much
 
03:02:11.750 --> 03:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
money um and you know it's a matter of
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
what's right and wrong so maybe it will
 
03:02:18.110 --> 03:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
cost us more if we stop getting it but
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
it's just like all the people that I'm
 
03:02:23.469 --> 03:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
aware of to receive who have who are
 
03:02:26.790 --> 03:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
ordered to pay child support through the
 
03:02:29.269 --> 03:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
state the state gets money from the
 
03:02:31.750 --> 03:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
federal government for
 
03:02:35.110 --> 03:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
processing child support then they turn
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
around and charge people paying child
 
03:02:39.870 --> 03:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
support a fee for doing them this
 
03:02:43.110 --> 03:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
service so they have to hire people to
 
03:02:46.469 --> 03:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
process the child support and they also
 
03:02:50.190 --> 03:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
then make mistakes and charge people
 
03:02:52.389 --> 03:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
with being delinquent threaten them and
 
03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
I know this for a fact I've heard it
 
03:02:57.950 --> 03:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
directly from the people they'll send
 
03:03:01.790 --> 03:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
threatening uh threats that they will be
 
03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
charged uh you know for for breaking the
 
03:03:08.429 --> 03:03:08.439 align:start position:0%
law for being uh delinquent and they
 
03:03:10.550 --> 03:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
aren't so then the people have to go
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
through missing work to set the record
 
03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:14.150 align:start position:0%

nothing but the truth yes thank
 
03:03:58.950 --> 03:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
you I wanted to clarify some things in
 
03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
regards to my husband's earlier
 
03:04:04.030 --> 03:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
testimony there were some things that uh
 
03:04:07.550 --> 03:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
were not very clear and I want to make
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
it known that our family is a blended
 
03:04:15.670 --> 03:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
family of five children um four live
 
03:04:19.870 --> 03:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
with the other party fulltime one is my
 
03:04:22.389 --> 03:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
child with my husband and she lives with
 
03:04:22.399 --> 03:04:23.590 align:start position:0%
child with my husband and she lives with
us

03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:04:25.910 --> 03:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
fulltime in regards to this alleged
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
incident there was only a safety plan
 
03:04:31.870 --> 03:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
made for four of the children where's
 
03:04:36.910 --> 03:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.990 --> 03:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
child where's the
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
concern if they believed that he did
 
03:04:42.720 --> 03:04:44.309 align:start position:0%
concern if they believed that he did
this

03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:04:47.670 --> 03:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
why only four where's the safety plan
 
03:04:49.950 --> 03:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
for my
 
03:04:54.030 --> 03:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
child that makes no sense to
 
03:04:56.590 --> 03:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
me the only other testimony I have is in
 
03:04:59.309 --> 03:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
regards to the home visit that is the
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
only other time that I have ever had
 
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
contact with the cpsw in question she
 
03:05:07.030 --> 03:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
came into our home had a walkthrough of
 
03:05:10.309 --> 03:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
our home was very it stated that she was
 
03:05:13.870 --> 03:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
very pleased with what she saw asked us
 
03:05:16.790 --> 03:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
questions in related to discipline and
 
03:05:18.550 --> 03:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
how we disciplined our
 
03:05:21.309 --> 03:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
children and was very pleased to hear
 
03:05:21.319 --> 03:05:23.070 align:start position:0%
children and was very pleased to hear
our

03:05:23.070 --> 03:05:23.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
answers and then she turned to my
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
husband and asked him how could you have
 
03:05:33.229 --> 03:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:35.469 --> 03:05:35.479 align:start position:0%
differently basically claiming my
 
03:05:42.269 --> 03:05:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:42.279 --> 03:05:44.389 align:start position:0%
 
speak

03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
I have an email chain with her where I
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
provided her a link to evidence photos
 
03:05:56.990 --> 03:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
videos text
 
03:06:01.030 --> 03:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
messages of and a witness list of two
 
03:06:04.229 --> 03:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
other adults that were
 
03:06:07.710 --> 03:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
there that were not that were never
 
03:06:10.750 --> 03:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
contacted she responded to this email
 
03:06:13.870 --> 03:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
chain confirming that she received
 
03:06:13.880 --> 03:06:14.750 align:start position:0%
chain confirming that she received
the

03:06:14.750 --> 03:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:17.710 --> 03:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
evidence and the
 
03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
email so why in the end will we finally
 
03:06:24.190 --> 03:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
got our records that we
 
03:06:30.269 --> 03:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:33.630 --> 03:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
report that makes no sense to me and of
 
03:06:34.750 --> 03:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
course there's going to be a
 
03:06:38.030 --> 03:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence when you
 
03:06:42.190 --> 03:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
omit an entire Side
 
03:06:42.200 --> 03:06:45.910 align:start position:0%
omit an entire Side
Story

03:06:45.910 --> 03:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:49.389 --> 03:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
and that is all I have to say thank you
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
very much for sharing those additional
 
03:06:54.150 --> 03:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
details those are also very important
 
03:06:54.160 --> 03:06:55.349 align:start position:0%
details those are also very important
any

03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:06:58.030 --> 03:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
questions I see no oh one question
 
03:06:59.790 --> 03:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you madam
 
03:07:02.070 --> 03:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for sharing that um I
 
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to hit on your question
 
03:07:06.269 --> 03:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
about the parenting plan that simply is
 
03:07:08.710 --> 03:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
that because there was any concerns with
 
03:07:10.990 --> 03:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
um your your shared child or you're
 
03:07:13.429 --> 03:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
looking at this as a concern about how
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
the the DCF is treating I am me merely
 
03:07:19.349 --> 03:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
trying to look from the outside in if
 
03:07:21.710 --> 03:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
there are five children that my husband
 
03:07:23.630 --> 03:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
has parenting time with one living with
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
him full-time why are you excluding the
 
03:07:28.190 --> 03:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
one child that he would have the most
 
03:07:31.870 --> 03:07:31.880 align:start position:0%
access to from any safety plan if you
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
really believe that any allegation is
 
03:07:38.790 --> 03:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
true why are you leaving a child in his
 
03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:44.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:07:44.550 --> 03:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:07:46.349 --> 03:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further questions
 
03:07:50.190 --> 03:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:52.510 --> 03:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
testimony okay I don't have any more
 
03:07:52.520 --> 03:07:54.830 align:start position:0%
testimony okay I don't have any more
cards

03:07:54.830 --> 03:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
cards
 
03:07:58.670 --> 03:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
here seeing did you have something to
 
03:08:00.830 --> 03:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
add right it just because can you step
 
03:08:02.910 --> 03:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
up to the
 
03:08:05.990 --> 03:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
microphone and state your name again and
 
03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
you're still under oath yes uh Andrew
 
03:08:11.710 --> 03:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
noise um just an earlier question that
 
03:08:13.670 --> 03:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
you had um
 
03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative kushman just because it
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
referred to one of the points that that
 
03:08:20.630 --> 03:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
I made in my testimony um if if you'd
 
03:08:22.309 --> 03:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
like I think that if you wanted to
 
03:08:24.550 --> 03:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
restate that question and then to
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative kolt's question I think
 
03:08:28.389 --> 03:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
just very very quickly that can be
 
03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
addressed if if if you'd like that which
 
03:08:34.510 --> 03:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
question so so you you asked about the
 
03:08:37.150 --> 03:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
the the aspect of common law and how
 
03:08:39.750 --> 03:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to apply to a court of
 
03:08:42.309 --> 03:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
record okay um and then representative
 
03:08:44.309 --> 03:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
kofalt had a question question about uh
 
03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
the Court's acknowledging statute so
 
03:08:51.070 --> 03:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
um yes if you have Insight on that go
 
03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
ahead yep so so as as Dan referred to
 
03:08:58.030 --> 03:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
the definition of common law um can be
 
03:09:01.910 --> 03:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
confusing when it's defined uh by
 
03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:04.439 align:start position:0%
attorneys who often have alterior
 
03:09:07.590 --> 03:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
motives but it's actually pretty
 
03:09:13.269 --> 03:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
distinctly defined as being um very very
 
03:09:17.429 --> 03:09:17.439 align:start position:0%
different from and opposed to uh
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
statutory law so common law and again
 
03:09:22.110 --> 03:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just reading right from blacks here
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
is distinguished from law created by the
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
enactment of
 
03:09:29.830 --> 03:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
legislator and so common law is that
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
body of Law and you refer to the
 
03:09:35.830 --> 03:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
maxims um which has been preserved in
 
03:09:37.950 --> 03:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
Antiquity and what's particularly
 
03:09:41.630 --> 03:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
pertinent here is that body of law and
 
03:09:43.389 --> 03:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
the law common to all men that the
 
03:09:46.429 --> 03:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
founders were looking at when they wrote
 
03:09:46.439 --> 03:09:47.469 align:start position:0%
founders were looking at when they wrote
our

03:09:47.469 --> 03:09:47.479 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
constitution um which is which is why
 
03:09:54.150 --> 03:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
and and then again going to um what a
 
03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional right is I referred to
 
03:09:57.429 --> 03:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
that earlier in my
 
03:10:00.190 --> 03:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
testimony um it's there can be no
 
03:10:02.550 --> 03:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
legislative interference with a
 
03:10:05.910 --> 03:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional right um I I don't know
 
03:10:08.030 --> 03:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
if that answered everything to your
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
point that it's very helpful definitely
 
03:10:15.670 --> 03:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
clarifying and then then um to represent
 
03:10:16.750 --> 03:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
kof Fall's point I don't know if you
 
03:10:18.630 --> 03:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to restate that question just to
 
03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that I get it correctly um
 
03:10:24.990 --> 03:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so yeah I was my my question
 
03:10:27.630 --> 03:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
was really to the statement to ask for a
 
03:10:29.229 --> 03:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
clarification of the statement that I
 
03:10:31.150 --> 03:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
was hearing the statement that I was
 
03:10:34.110 --> 03:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
hearing was that courts of record render
 
03:10:35.910 --> 03:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
decisions or should be rendering
 
03:10:40.870 --> 03:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
decisions based on the Constitution and
 
03:10:44.030 --> 03:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
common law and then the
 
03:10:47.349 --> 03:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
as close as I can remember not on
 
03:10:49.710 --> 03:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
statute or precedent and I and I heard
 
03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
the justification for the precedent part
 
03:10:54.429 --> 03:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me like that statement was
 
03:10:58.030 --> 03:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
excluding statute was it and and again
 
03:10:59.630 --> 03:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you about somebody else's
 
03:11:01.590 --> 03:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
intent when they made the
 
03:11:05.389 --> 03:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
statement what is your interpretation is
 
03:11:08.110 --> 03:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
do do courts of are courts of record
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
to exclude statute or are they to um
 
03:11:16.389 --> 03:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
interpret things through the lens of
 
03:11:18.429 --> 03:11:18.439 align:start position:0%
first the Constitution Second common law
 
03:11:21.630 --> 03:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
and then interpret statute and render
 
03:11:23.670 --> 03:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
decisions based on that right yeah so
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um it's definitely
 
03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
the former um because a court of record
 
03:11:31.550 --> 03:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
has to move under the common law and a
 
03:11:33.910 --> 03:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
common law action is one which is
 
03:11:37.590 --> 03:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
governed by the common law rather than
 
03:11:40.630 --> 03:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
statutory it must only be considering
 
03:11:42.910 --> 03:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
the common law and and the con
 
03:11:45.269 --> 03:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
constitution in its judgments and and as
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
that pertains to um the question of due
 
03:11:51.750 --> 03:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
process and how that's applying to
 
03:11:56.070 --> 03:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
dcyf statutes are most often referred to
 
03:11:59.190 --> 03:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
and utilized when taking these these
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
rights away and to Dan's Point earlier
 
03:12:05.630 --> 03:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
if these hearings were in a court of
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
record in in a true common law Court of
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
record and uh the the matters of being
 
03:12:17.269 --> 03:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
heard before a
 
03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:22.200 align:start position:0%
jury of 12 of that person's peers
 
03:12:25.110 --> 03:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
um and they they were not using using
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
statute which does not comport with the
 
03:12:31.229 --> 03:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
common law right because that this came
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
after the Constitution was was written
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
and and the common law um um doctrines
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
and theories which were used to
 
03:12:42.030 --> 03:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
establish these rights that we're
 
03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
talking about here and that we're
 
03:12:47.469 --> 03:12:47.479 align:start position:0%
considering as it pertains to Du process
 
03:12:49.710 --> 03:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
came before and again referencing that
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
decision out of California there's a
 
03:12:54.309 --> 03:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
pretty narrow historical window we have
 
03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
to look at for what the intention was in
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
our constitution for a due process and
 
03:13:07.229 --> 03:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
that is what we look to the maxims and
 
03:13:09.830 --> 03:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh and common law for and as that
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
applies to to the Constitution so again
 
03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
in short yes a true Court of record is
 
03:13:21.710 --> 03:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
not going to be utilizing statute only
 
03:13:23.750 --> 03:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
common law as it pertains to the rights
 
03:13:27.670 --> 03:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:29.790 --> 03:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
people any further
 
03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
03:13:35.710 --> 03:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
again and with that we will well since
 
03:13:37.750 --> 03:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
everyone's gone I guess we'll we'll push
 
03:13:40.190 --> 03:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
off the uh discussion and we'll take
 
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
this uh subject matter up uh among the
 
03:13:44.190 --> 03:13:44.200 align:start position:0%

03:13:46.510 --> 03:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
