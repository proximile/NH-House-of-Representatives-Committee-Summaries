00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
rating for the amendment and uh but what
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
we'll do in the meantime is have the
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor tell us what we'll see when we
 
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.030 align:start position:0%
sponsor tell us what we'll see when we
get

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
it thank you very much Mr chairman um
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
I'm very thankful that they actually got
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment drafted before we begun
 
00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
and began and uh they're busy killing
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
trees upstairs so we can read the actual
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
document I provided you all with an
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
amendment summary and the language that
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
I submitted to OS so that you can see
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
what the changes are um so as bit of a
 
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
history um last week we were here and
 
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:04.519 align:start position:0%
there was the idea of do we try and get
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
closer to what will be an actual
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
passable bill that fits the needs of all
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders and everybody involved
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
in this process so with that um I spoke
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
with a few of the Senators who were very
 
00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959 align:start position:0%
involved in this and um I spoke to
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
others trying to figure out where we can
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
make our bill closer to something that
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
would get broad support in the Senate um
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's quite a few changes within here
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
um and um I can run through those uh the
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
first part that I did is we all working
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
from the governor's list of list for
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
what would be needed in a bill that he
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
would not veto because that is the
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
framework that we're all working through
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
um I added into the purpose and finding
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
a section on that and how this bill
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
addresses those needs because sometimes
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit unclear um our
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
reduction to poly drugs is um the fact
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
fact that we're introducing 15 stores at
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
first and making sure that we can
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
increase those stores in the future if
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
we find that people in some regions of
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
the state are only accessing thank you
 
00:14:12.749 --> 00:14:12.759 align:start position:0%
only accessing illicit cannabis because
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
that is not the harm reduction that's
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
intended by the governor so having that
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
within our our expectations for in the
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
future evaluating the number of stores
 
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:22.360 align:start position:0%
is a good way to make sure that we meet
 
00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
that stated goal of the governor to
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
reduce access to illicit Market cannabis
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
Ted tainted by Fentanyl and to reduce
 
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
the other harms that come from
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
that um we also speak he had also wanted
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
to have a ban on lobbying and donations
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
and that one is problematic um but I
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
believe that the core of that is that if
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
we set up a program where only a select
 
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
few are able to participate in the
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
market and if that process isn't
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
transparent then the potential and the
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
concern that people may not think that
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
things are on the up and up is so high
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
that I assume that that's why he wants
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
to have the limitation on the lobbying
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
IND donations so to address that by
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
doing it instead of a franchise model
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
but a highly regulated and transparent
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
process we're able to remove some of
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
that squish factor from decisions where
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
um in the ru making the Liquor
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
Commission will lay out what they're
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
looking for and how they're judging
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
people so that people know ahead of time
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
and they have a process where people can
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
have transparency about
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know who understood the assignment
 
00:15:33.629 --> 00:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
and who was able to deliver and in a
 
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
limited market I think that's what we
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
should move for those people who can
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
actually fit the requirements of the
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
program and also making sure that the
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
laws and administrative rules don't pick
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
favorites but have that transparent
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
process I think really eliminates that
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
concern um that is well founded when
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
only 15 people potentially only three
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
with the commission language that says
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
15 stores owning up to five of them if
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
you had people who are operating the
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
entire Market that's uh a concerning
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
situation and I understand why under
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
that Paradigm there would be a reason to
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
not have lobbying or contributions so
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
let's just do a better
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
Paradigm um there were quite a few
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
sections and the definitions where I
 
00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:18.519 align:start position:0%
went through a lot of those details and
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
Nuance with Senator abbis and we figured
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
out where he had a better definition or
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
he liked mine um that's in the back of
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
it you guys can peruse that at some
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
point or just
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
trust that any mistakes will get fixed
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
future another section that has been a
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
big deal breaker for some is the idea of
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
a dual use license the Dual use was laid
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
out as a store that was overseen both by
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission and by the
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
in order to be a hybrid store and
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center retail
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
location um this whole framework allows
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
retail outlets to sell therapeutic
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis and since retail outlets can
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
sell therapeutic cannabis sourced
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
atcs um the need for specific separate
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
license it would only be necessary if we
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise wouldn't allow the atcs to
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
participate um instead of giving a
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
guarantee we need to ensure that they
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
can compete for these and that one of
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
the factors that's recognized in the
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
application process is that if somebody
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
has operated a successful uh alternative
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
treatment center in the state that that
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
should be one of the factors under
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
consideration that only the atcs who
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
have been operating will be able to meet
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
that so it'll be one extra extra little
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
tally in their court because they've
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
been here they've done this Market they
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
provided access to our patients but it
 
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:49.640 align:start position:0%
won't be the only deciding factor which
 
00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
provides transparency and is fair
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
because you also you know we have great
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
operators here but you still want to you
 
00:17:58.750 --> 00:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
still want to set it up in language that
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that you can't just come
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
in with the absolute minimal minimal
 
00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
deliverable product you need to actually
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
be offering a good service to the people
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so that guarantees that
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to be just as sharp with
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
their pencil setting up their strategy
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
else no I still have some more but let's
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
go through if there's questions on the
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
topics okay we we if you want to do that
 
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
we'll ask at the end um then there is
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
also a big concern about the law
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement prohibition
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
um that one was a deal breaker for one
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
of the Senators because he was concerned
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
about Blue on Blue if uh the federal
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
government was coming in and raiding
 
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere in swat unmarked and somebody
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
reported a home invasion local police
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
respond and then suddenly you have local
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
police having um a a shootout with the
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
federal government so the idea of not
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
notifying law enforcement I have removed
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
from the bill I know it seems like a
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
stretch but these days with swatting
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
attacks you never know so let's make
 
00:19:01.149 --> 00:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
sure that this bill the way that it's
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
amended would make it so that law
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement at the St state or local
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
level won't exp expending resources to
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
pursue cannabis as a federal crime as
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
long as it's consistent with our laws
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
but it does allow them to talk to the
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
federal government if the feds do decide
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
to pursue this and quite frankly if the
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
feds feds tell them that they're coming
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
in and pursuing this it would be nice
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
for them to know because maybe they can
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
let everybody involved know hold on the
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
whole situation has changed and now the
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
federal government is enforcing this if
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
you want to get out probably now is a
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
good time to get out of this business
 
00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
and this market so that communication I
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
think should be
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
preserved um next comes the smoking in
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
public one of the highly contentious
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
issues um in the bill we did not have a
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but we've come to a
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
compromise that the first offense is a
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
violation and you forfeit all the
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
Cannabis and cannabis products on your
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
person not in your car if you've just
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
gone and purchased it not in in your
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
house but what you're physically in
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
possession of because if you're out and
 
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
smoking it in public you know there's a
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
lot of people that have a really big
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
problem with that um and I understand
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm not a cigarette smoker so I
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't like that either but I uh it's
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
just one of those ideas of being a nice
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
respectful neighbor on the second
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
offense within five years it would be a
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
fine up to $500 in the forfeiture of the
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
Cannabis and products on your person and
 
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
then um after two or more prior
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
convictions within three five years it
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
becomes a misdemeanor um I had really
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
been looking at the Class B misdemeanor
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
and then the issue was raised that what
 
00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
about somebody who's on her fifth sixth
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
or seventh smoking in public violation
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
at that point if somebody's really
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
flagrant about it and they just don't
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
care it would make sense that if
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
somebody just keeps flagrantly violating
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
our law and getting caught then maybe
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
some jail time should be on the table so
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
that's why it's not designated as a
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
Class B um it's a non-starter over in
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
the Senate if we don't have it is just a
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor as opposed to a class B so
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
um that's a compromise that I've made
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
and speaking with stakeholders um it
 
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
seems to be acceptable to
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
them there's a couple other details that
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
probably are a little bit too far into
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
the weeds and discussing it with the
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
Senators but um as turning to the next
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
page where I have my nine and 10 and my
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
numbering wasn't great a lot of that is
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
just moving the Dual use out but the
 
00:21:26.669 --> 00:21:26.679 align:start position:0%
language instead of guaranteeing the ATC
 
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
as a store would now say providing that
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
a major criteria in assessing the
 
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
relative merits of each application will
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
incorporate the successful operation of
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
an alternative treatment center
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
registered under RSA
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
126x and may convert to a cannabis
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
retail outlet for sales permitted under
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
this chapter and RSA 126x so that makes
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
it clear that the intention is that they
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
can continue that they can offer both
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
when they if they do get a retail outlet
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
and open that um another one too reading
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
through the governor's list
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
he seems very strong on the 15 while
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
also being pretty strong on the idea
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
that the whole point of this is harm
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
reduction not profits and to make sure
 
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
that the illicit Market is a lot less
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
attractive because unfortunately we have
 
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
people in our state dying because
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
they're buying cannabis on the street
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's been contaminated with fentanyl
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
um since that is one of the overarching
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
goals in passing this legislation um in
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
the section talking about increasing the
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
number of stores um I added the words
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
increase that one of the reasons to
 
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
increase the number of stores is to
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
increase access to Legal cannabis in New
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for people throughout the
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
state this is so that if the first 15
 
00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:41.559 align:start position:0%
stores just pop up in the Southern Tier
 
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
that there might be a reason to make
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
sure that people in the North Country
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
aren't left to cross a border or turn to
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
the streets because we want to make sure
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
that harm reduction isn't just for those
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
people and highly populated areas but
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
for gramit Staters
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
throughout see also so there was
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
something that everybody had
 
00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:04.039 align:start position:0%
overlooked everywhere you have to be 21
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
years of age or older to go into a
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis store that was nowhere in any
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
of the versions of the bill because
 
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
we're also going to be having access for
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
um therapeutic cannabis um I replaced
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
the entire section that was about dual
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
use with entry to cannabis retail
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
outlets limited entry to cannabis retail
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
outlet shall be restricted to people to
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
21 years of age or older Who present
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
documentation consistent with that
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
section and qualifying patients that way
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
there's access for patients if they have
 
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
a a retail outlet closer and they don't
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
want to go to an ATC location if those
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
are still operating then they can get
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
that access but otherwise you're not
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
going to have people under 21 in those
 
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
stores because we shouldn't have people
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
under 21 in those
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
stores and then a couple things about
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
the municipal so that it's a municipal
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
election and so the bienal so we're not
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
bringing a whole C cost making sure the
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
municipality needs to actually tell the
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
commission that the application meets
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
the local requirements and adding that
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
into the whole process for application
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
approval and then finally in
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations um the 2 million that we
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
had in there looking at every other
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
version is probably not enough 8 million
 
00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:20.919 align:start position:0%
was the seconde amount in what passed
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
through Ways and Means last year so the
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation for administration of this
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
chapter is now $8 million
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the allocation of funds has also
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
been changed um apparently a lot of
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
people don't want their pensions paid
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
for by pot and since since we've been
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
talking about all these different issues
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
of try of tying in um just trying to
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not creating new
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
problems with the federal government
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
having that be the primary primary place
 
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
that money goes doesn't really make
 
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
sense um as I was balancing this I
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
looked at to House Bill 639 that passed
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
the house last year I looked at what
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
Senator abbis had proposed um within
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
that passing the house had 15% going to
 
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
um the pensions abbis has 20% going to
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
the pensions so I did keep 15% going to
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
the pensions just because it's such a
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
large unfunded liability but I'd be
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
willing to send that to education if you
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
prefer to just keep pensions out of it
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
entirely then uh 10% goes to the
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
Community reinvestment Fund so that one
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
is largely providing water and sewer
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
access because Water and Sewer access is
 
00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
one of the big limitations for new
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
housing Construction in the state and
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
rather than rather than that would be a
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
good way to make sure that we can have
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
some of that infrastructure that will
 
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
help make more affordable housing it
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
also would allow for some legal aid for
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
people that are seeking annulments and
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
whatnot so it's just kind of a nice way
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that some of this money
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
goes back to the community in specific
 
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
areas then uh 10% to the substance use
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment and Recovery Fund
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
that's created in this act 5% of
 
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
broad-based Aid to the municipalities
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
that have a retail store um so this is
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
one that had had a little bit of push
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
back when I was speaking with the
 
00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
Senators but um in their model they had
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
a 15% uh fee excise tax fee whichever
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it with 1% of
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
that going to the municipality by doing
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
that that's actually 6 and
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
23% so they already had that same
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
intention of making sure that those
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
communities who did Step Up in order to
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
have these stores have a little bit more
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
money to handle potentially traffic
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
issues or anything else that's around
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
there um and this is something that's
 
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
been consistent in several of the bills
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
then 5% um without a cap as had been in
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
the bill previously to public safety
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
agent agencies having more drug
 
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.120 align:start position:0%
recognition experts um so that people
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
can actually when driving Intoxicated by
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis and Other Drugs including
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
medications is a big net positive for
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
our society the only substance that has
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
a per se limit that if you violate a
 
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
tested limit is alcohol but there are
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
people that drive impaired from all
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
sorts of substances from cocaine to
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine to cannabis to Benadryl
 
00:27:16.669 --> 00:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
so having more drug drug recognition
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
help experts will help all of us well
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
all of us who uh don't make those
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
terrible decisions I should say and then
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
5% it wasn't in this bill but it's been
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
every other B every other version says
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
that 5% goes for Behavioral Health on
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
the children's Behavioral Health so that
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
would deal with the kids that are
 
00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:36.200 align:start position:0%
getting boarded in emergency rooms and
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
not getting the mental health care that
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
they need and when we're not sending as
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
much to the pensions it makes sense to
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
loop back that back in So this brings it
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
back significantly to um what had
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
already passed through Ways and Means
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
last year so that we have a more
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
consistent view um this gets as close to
 
00:27:58.029 --> 00:27:58.039 align:start position:0%
um gets as close to everything that I
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
had in the discussions with Senator
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
abbis and Senator Lang although it does
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
not have the franchise model um I'm I
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
remain concerned that a franchise model
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the transparency that we
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
need for public trust and I think that
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
when we set up a system like this public
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
trust is the most important thing that
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
we need to keep because public trust
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and making sure that there
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
is accountability and then nobody's
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
wondering why a particular operator got
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
the got the um license I think is going
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people just look at
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
this as a new market that's opening up
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
instead of a less favorable view so I
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
think we've actually made phenomenal
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
progress here you know looking back and
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
seeing all of these metrics I I didn't
 
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
quite appreciate just how many changes
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
we made I think that they make it better
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
um obviously there's a couple
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
compromises where we could have gone one
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
way or the other but I think this is now
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
an excellent bill that I hope will have
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know strong support of everybody who
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
believes in any sort of um legalization
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis and to move forward with a very
 
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.110 align:start position:0%
cannabis and to move forward with a very
strong

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
strong
 
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
Bill okay now represent
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
spear I I just wanted a clarification so
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
the ATC uh the therapeutic Cannabis
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
stores that exist now they would still
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
exist they don't get folded into this
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
unless we do something as you described
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the change that you made um
 
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
so there's been nothing that would close
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
those stores um I don't see anything
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
within this law or anything else that
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
would close those stores um one of the
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
big questions would what has been about
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
whether or not they'd want to convert
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
those stores to a retail outlet um some
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
people think that they wouldn't because
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
they may or may not be in the best
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
locations um they may actually be
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
interested in doing that and competing
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
either in the same store or elsewhere
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
but if they have to compete on equal
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
footing to get one of the the outlet
 
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
licenses um I think that the choice of
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
location is just part of that
 
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.669 align:start position:0%
location is just part of that
application

00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
process representative burough is
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.830 align:start position:0%
process representative burough is
next

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
next
 
00:30:01.549 --> 00:30:01.559 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question and um I
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't think you addressed
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
this and I'm going to use a phrase I
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
really hate but um it says that the
 
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
atc's um must be considered a successful
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
operation should be considered a major
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
factor what is that major factor and how
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
do we give it suspenders that's the
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
phrase I hate uh thank you that's a
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
really good question and that's one of
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
those parts that would come up in
 
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules um and so then we
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we express what
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
that legislative intent is I mean how
 
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
much of a factor do we think that that
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
should have I know that in a tie a tie
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
should go to the ATC but beyond that tie
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
how much more of a boost should it get
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's a good
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
discussion and one that probably should
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
happen in public hearings with full
 
00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:47.519 align:start position:0%
transparency in the process of rul
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
making just because it's hard to know
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
until the entire rubric is set
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
out okay representative Gibbs thank you
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh how have the uh representatives of
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
the current atc's responded to this
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
proposed change to the bill um thank you
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
I I had sent some proposed language
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
previously about how I was working
 
00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:13.039 align:start position:0%
towards it to try and get the best
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
language um I actually sent the email to
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
them with a specific language and then
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
drove up here so I haven't looked at my
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
email to see specifically what they say
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
but I do know that there are some of
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
them here yes we can certainly invite
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
them up to
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
speak any other
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
questions okay don't go far I will thank
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
you okay anyone in the at want to speak
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
for the atc's and where they are with
 
00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.269 align:start position:0%
for the atc's and where they are with
this

00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.120 align:start position:0%
go thank you Mr
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record Matt Simon
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
Granite Leaf
 
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis so I did just receive this
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
amendment when you did and have skimmed
 
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
it not read it thoroughly
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
um I think there are two sets of
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
comments I'd like to make and first of
 
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
all I'd like to thank the sponsor for
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
her hard work in putting this together
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank everybody who's
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
patiently participated in this process
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get us to a workable
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
compromise I think there are two sets of
 
00:32:31.389 --> 00:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
issues here that often get lumped
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
together in this one is what happens to
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
the atcs which are three cannabis
 
00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:38.519 align:start position:0%
companies that exist in New Hampshire
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
that have been operating for more than
 
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.909 align:start position:0%
that have been operating for more than
seven

00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:32:40.919 --> 00:32:42.990 align:start position:0%
seven
years

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh this bill creates
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
uh criteria that would cause the atcs to
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
likely be able to get a retail license
 
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
and uh speaking from for granite Leaf
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis only I can't speak for the
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
others we support that concept uh we're
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
willing to work with that um there is
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
another set of questions and concerns
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
what happens to the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
program which now serves more than
 
00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.310 align:start position:0%
program which now serves more than
14,000

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
14,000
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
patients when we say every adult use
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
store can also serve patients I think
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
that's very different than saying every
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
store is going to be a dual use
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
facility atcs exist to serve patients
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
that's our mission we're required to do
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
it by law we're required to provide
 
00:33:39.389 --> 00:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
educational and support
 
00:33:39.399 --> 00:33:41.149 align:start position:0%
educational and support
services

00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
and just gaming this out say we apply
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
for these retail license we receive it
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
we build a fancy new building which I
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
think we're willing to do
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh comply with every aspect of the new
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
program assuming that this rolls out
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
successfully we know that there will be
 
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.990 align:start position:0%
successfully we know that there will be
a

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
substantial plummeting in the number of
 
00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:05.509 align:start position:0%
substantial plummeting in the number of
patient

00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
registrations and uh sales at the atc's
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
in Vermont they just finished one year
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
of retail sales 50% reduction in patient
 
00:34:18.669 --> 00:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
registrations roughly the same I'm
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
assuming for total number of sales in
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
that case it wasn't catastrophic for for
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
the the businesses because they all had
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
graded licenses and were already able to
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
expand to serve adults so the fact that
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
their medical business
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
suffered wasn't too harmful for them but
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont is now trying to figure out how
 
00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
to actually restore these Services uh so
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
that the patients who are getting their
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis from adult youth stores do
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
receive education and support so I'm
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
confident that can be done my concern is
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
that by not allowing the Dual use
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
language and and it's not here so I
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
can't refer to it but the Dual use
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
language was more
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
about requiring that patients continue
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
to receive
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
Service uh requiring that atc's don't
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
just drop the medical thing and start
 
00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
serving adults and trying to make as
 
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
much money as possible rather than
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
producing the wide range of products we
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
currently produce and operating the way
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
we current operate so my concern is that
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
about a year after adult use stor are
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
open that all of the ATC Medical Only
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
dispensaries will shut down are we
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
expected to continue operating them
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
after they become money losers I'm
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're setting up
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
incentives that
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
steer uh in the direction of shutting
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
down the medical program and just
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
treating cannabis Like Liquor those are
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
my comments I'm not saying I'm for or
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
against anything or telling anybody what
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
to do on the ATC subject we have three
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
different companies that can weigh in
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
for themselves I I do think it would
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
make sense to hear from the Department
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services which
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
administers the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
program because that's an important
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
policy Choice do we care about
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining a healthy therapeutic
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis program uh or do we care about
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that the three companies
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
have a path forward I care about both
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
things and uh that's where I currently
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
am with this so so if I understand
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
correctly if we remove the dual use the
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
atcs continue as they are which is they
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
won't have to pay a tax or collect a tax
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me fee right because if you
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
were operating under this new license
 
00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
there is a 10% call what you
 
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.710 align:start position:0%
there is a 10% call what you
want

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
collection yes Mr chairman in Vermont
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
that's a 20% tax and that incentive did
 
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
not stop a 50% reduction in one year in
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
the patients so that
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
it uh so this people weren't driven by
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
the medical because the was were they
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
not the that 20% difference that was not
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
a marginal num I guess we're saying is
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
that the to have one close by was more
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
important than paying that 20% fee I
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
believe that was a major factor I've
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
also heard anecdotic excuse me
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that some adult use
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
businesses are essentially paying the
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
taxes for patients as a work around
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
because they want their business or in
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
some cases they believe in serving
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
patients so i' I've heard of that
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
happening in Maine and Vermont where
 
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
companies will just sort of voluntarily
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
eat the tax or pay it for patient
 
00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.710 align:start position:0%
eat the tax or pay it for patient
transactions

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.270 align:start position:0%
transactions
interesting

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you for T taking my
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
question what happens to the nonprofit
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
status that you now have with the
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
atc's this bill includes an opportunity
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
for-profit that's good
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
right that's what you wanted yes Mr
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
chairman not necessarily what I what I
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
wanted okay yes represent thanks for
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question can you tell me what
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
what is the value add for let's say a
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
patient who goes to the um to one of
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
your fac facilities versus now getting
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
it from a retail what are they getting
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
from you that's important for them as a
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
patient so any patient who comes for the
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
first time uh we offer and recommend
 
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
that they set up a consultation with one
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
of our patient Educators we have a staff
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
member at both of our facilities whose
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
primary job it is to sit down with
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
patients many patients have never tried
 
00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:55.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis before or they've tried it many
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
years ago and have now been recommended
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
to to do it by a doctor they have no
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
idea where to begin they they don't know
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
about the different types of products
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
how they're administered what the pros
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
and cons of one product versus another
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
might be so we sit with them and ask
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
them questions like what is your
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
previous experience with cannabis what
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
symptoms are you trying to manage what
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
other medications are you on they're
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
trained to know about interactions so if
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
they're already on medication that would
 
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:22.390 align:start position:0%
they're already on medication that would
be

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
problematic um you know some people have
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
been using cannabis for a long time and
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
and don't need or want that kind of
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
education but for the subset of the
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
population that we that that we deal
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
with it's it's I think we've reduced a
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
lot of harm if I may invoke that harm
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
reduction phrase I I I was very
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
encouraged to hear the governor mention
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
harm reduction so many times in his
 
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
statement that's my view of cannabis
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
regulation and medical cannabis
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
specifically is that it is primarily a
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
harm reduction program and should be
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
guided by those principles principles
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't see how diminishing the
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program is
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
consistent with a harm reduction
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
approach to cannabis so I'd like to find
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
a way to keep our program intact if
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
there's a way to do that while also
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
compromise okay thank you very
 
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
much is there anybody else who would
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:30.190 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
yeah make sure you hit the mic here
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman um uh my
 
00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
name is Devon chaffy I'm the executive
 
00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
director of the ACLU of New Hampshire um
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll be fairly brief uh I want to
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank representative Leon for all of her
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
persistent work on this current draft um
 
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
I think I have one uh significant
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
concern um with the current draft um and
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
similar to a concern that I had with the
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
previous draft that you saw at the last
 
00:40:59.309 --> 00:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
work session last week and that is the
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
idea that people will under this draft
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
potentially be facing jail time for
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
smoking small amounts of marijuana in
 
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
public um that is actually a much
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
harsher uh penalty than we currently
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
have so if you have less than 3/4 uh
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
ounces currently in public and you are
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
smoking in public under existing law um
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
the most significant uh uh potential
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
penalty that you would face would be a
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor one of the other
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
benefits of of categorizing it is a
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor you know it's it's
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
still pot it's still on someone's record
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
it's still a a significant penalty um
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
but you're not facing jail time which
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
also means that the taxpayers of New
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire aren't potentially paying for
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
public defenders to represent people who
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
were simply caught smoking in public um
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
I think from um a uh just a fairness and
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
a Justice lens and from what we're
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish with this
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
legislation the idea that we would be
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
criminalizing um you know nonviolent
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
activity that right now is not
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
criminalized through passage of the
 
00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:11.839 align:start position:0%
marijuana legalization law in a way that
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
would have much stiffer penalties than
 
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
currently exist and potentially putting
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
people in jail simply for smoking and
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
possessing very small amounts of
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
marijuana I think does not make sense um
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's one area in this
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
draft that I have concerns with
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
thank so but that that's the third
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
offense right within fiveyear period
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
correct so given that and I've talked to
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
our County district attorney and he told
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
me nobody pursues a case they just they
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
don't bother so third offense means that
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
there was district attorneys that were
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
willing to pursue it not once not
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
twice but three times times so isn't
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
that kind of saying that this person is
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
really almost intentionally trying to
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
flaunt the law at that
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
point I think that the penalty for this
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
particular crime um uh needs to be
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
commensurate with the seriousness of the
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
offense this is not a property crime
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is not a violent crime this is not
 
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
a crime that's an endangering other fol
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
FKS um there are many things for which
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh that are violations of the law for
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
which you might face a fine for which we
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
do not believe that somebody should in
 
00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
fact go to jail no matter how many times
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
they potentially May violate the law in
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
my humble opinion um this offense is one
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
of them it should be treated instead
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
like say uh you know you can't go to
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
jail for instance for for smoking in a
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
um you know in a in in an indoors you
 
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
know there are violations for that but
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
that isn't a criminal offense for which
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
you could potentially see jail time that
 
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
the severity of that offense regardless
 
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
of how many times that person has
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
potentially offended seems not
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
commensurate with the offense to me
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
driving may may I so I just want to say
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to go down the
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
thing say marijuana is not as bad as
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol that you think it's okay that
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
people smoke pot while they're driving a
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
car um with all due respect uh chairman
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
I believe that that is a separate part
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
of the bill that addresses the issue
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
that is a a very talk about we we if you
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
have a third DWI you go to jail well yes
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
sir as you so what how's that any
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
difference in three three times being
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
busted smoking marijuana while you're
 
00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
driving and in my opinion um it is it is
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
very different in that by drunk driving
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
you are putting people's lives and
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
health and safety at risk when you take
 
00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
to the wheel when you are intoxicated
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
you are potentially putting people's uh
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
life's at risk by smoking in public that
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
is not at all we're talking about third
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
time that could be in the car that third
 
00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
three times you that is a different
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
section of the bill chairman that
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
actually deals with in I just using an
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
example of how they might have gotten
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
arrested okay and that I was saying is
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
why you know in terms of uh three times
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
of uh drinking p in
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
public uh I bet you we that's
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
potentially a Class B also Class A I
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
know I think three times if you you know
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
I mean that's just how is this any
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
different than alcohol and the alcohol
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
laws if this mirrors what we do with
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
alcohol then I don't I don't understand
 
00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
where you're going with it no um I I
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know whether or not it
 
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
mirrors a public drinking ordinance I
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be happy to investigate that for
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
you and and get you your answers on that
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
well and I think that's a much more
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
comparable law would be drinking in
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
public as opposed to exactly drinking in
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
public because there are plenty of
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
communities that ban you know alcohol
 
00:46:04.589 --> 00:46:04.599 align:start position:0%
consumption in public but I was just
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
using cars an example because that's
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
where most people drunk driving or
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
drunks that's where most of them are
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
arrested is in cars representative
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
Sullivan we haven't heard from you
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
yet I wasn't trying to talk but uh to
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
your point what you were saying I I I I
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
agree with her that your analogy with
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
smoking and driving is different than
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
smoking in public I think that that's
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
what she was saying I think she did a
 
00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
good job of explaining it I think if
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to do drunk
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
driving and smoking in driving that's
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
there are analogies there and then
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's analogies with how we treat
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
drinking in parks and smoking in parks
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
and that's what we should look at but
 
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
don't try toate the I would be no doubt
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
on my mind I mean I I mean I I can't say
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
what what goes on in New Hampshire or in
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach but I know you know we're
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
my summer home in Rhode Island yeah you
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
you can potentially go to jail for your
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
first time being caught drinking on the
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
the public beach the State
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
Beach so I don't know what what the New
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law is so but anyways let's
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
have a conversation where what do people
 
00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
feel about this amendment and we'll
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
start with you
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
Jared um I think that we've done a
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
pretty good job coming up with
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
compromises that
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know make people get
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
everybody gets a little bit and gave up
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
a lot feels like um do I love it no but
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
I think if I prioritize the things that
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
are most important to me it is the harm
 
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
reduction of people who consume it and
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
right now maybe you're getting it from a
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
legal sources that have fentanyl or
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
other things Lac into it and then also
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
the arresting of people and ruining
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
their lives because they're in caught
 
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
they're caught in possession of it or
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
whatever so those are the top priorities
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
for me I think it's no secret to this
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
committee and many people that I not a
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
fan of the state run model I think it's
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
an inefficient way to do it and I think
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to be something that gener
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
Generations from now people are going to
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
be frustrated with in the way that uh
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
We've structured it today and this is
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
our one time to get it right but am I
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
willing to swallow that bitter pill to
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
reduce the harm reduction I am and
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
hoping that maybe maybe at some point in
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
the future maybe another bot another uh
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
group of people sitting in this room in
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
a decade or what election will be coming
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
up before this bill will ever go into
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
effect so well well and and I'm I'm
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
saying it's probably going to be you
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
know years from now when that would
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
happen hopefully these things get
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
addressed but um I think it's it's
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that we don't have people
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
who are and I'll just kind of say this
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
publicly I think it's unfortunate that
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
we have so many people in this state who
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
are unwilling to um get away from the
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
fear of it and so that we has to be so
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
restricted to the point that there is
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
the potential that that the elicit
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
Market isn't wiped out because we have
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
only 15 stores or we have a state-run
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
model where the door opens for
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
corruption despite I think
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon's best attempts I
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
think that the door is still open for
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
corruption particularly as people get
 
00:49:12.069 --> 00:49:12.079 align:start position:0%
those first licenses and when new
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
licenses become proposed they want that
 
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
moat to protect their business and I
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
think the language does its best it it
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
can I had suggested uh automatic numbers
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
of licenses being released I was told
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
that was probably not sellable in the in
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate which is unfortunate um
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
there's also the anchoring concerns we
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
discussed last time which I thought were
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
valid um but I think this model does
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
does nothing or canot totally eliminate
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
the idea that we're going to allow the
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
industry to capture the benefits of this
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
and I think we should we should be aware
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
of that and the people who are so
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to a more free market approach
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
should understand the consequences of
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
their what I would call stubborn Ness on
 
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
this issue and so uh that's where I
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
stand but I will I will swallow the
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
bitter pill and support this bill
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
because I think the benefits outweigh
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
the cost but I think uh it's it is hard
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
for me to swallow and I might share this
 
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
on I might share this little monologue
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
that I just shared with you all on the
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
floor I haven't decided yet but I might
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of say
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
that maybe representative brose thinks
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
that's a bad idea okay representative
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
spear you're next because you're
 
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
replacing Representative Vincent today
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I seem to do that a lot uh
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
thanks um I think it's it's it's a far
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
cry from what we started with last year
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
which I really liked and which would
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
pass which passed the house
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly so it's in that way it's
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
a little disappointing it still has the
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
annulment feature in it which I
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
considered very
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
important uh the Dual use I understand
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and so I'm okay I guess
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
there might be a way to make that
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
workable I
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
hope I being a of a business mind has
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
anybody ever done an analysis to see if
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
you put out 15 stores now remember we're
 
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
being competed against all around us on
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
all sides of our state will 15 stores
 
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
even make this thing survive as a first
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
shot when we have competition everywhere
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know I have my doubts as to
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not this will even survive
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
the theory is that that the 10% fee is
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
half of what our competitor elds to
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
other states around us are but like it
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
was pointed out to us uh some people
 
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't care about that some people will
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
say all right if I can drive five
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
minutes and go to tsoro I'm going to do
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
that because it's going to save me how
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
much in gas if I have to go you know
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
however many miles away sometimes the
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
convenience of it is much more important
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
than saving a couple of dollars so I
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
wonder if we'll live okay representative
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
burough is next thanks I just I want to
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
go back to what um Miss chaffy said from
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
the ACLU that really stuck with me um
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
when she testified that this is our
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
window to get this done and while it's
 
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
not 100% of what anybody wants we're
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
taking a crapshoot if we don't pass it
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
this year we don't know we don't know
 
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
who's coming into the governor's office
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
we don't know who's going to be um I
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
know what you think who's going to be in
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
the majority who going to be in this
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
chair who's going to be in that chair
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
right um I know what I think but um I
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
think it'd be a crapshoot not to pass
 
00:52:35.789 --> 00:52:35.799 align:start position:0%
this um it could be 2 years four years 6
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
years 8 years and how many more times
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
are we going to go through this it's
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's like Groundhog's Day so I think
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative Leon did an amazing job
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
of you know look listening to everybody
 
00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:49.559 align:start position:0%
and and compromising on things that it's
 
00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
as close it's as close as we're going to
 
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
get to uh a a bill that everyone can
 
00:52:56.430 --> 00:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
agree on
 
00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.829 align:start position:0%
agree on
okay

00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:02.359 align:start position:0%
Rees I'm just worried about um uh the
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
licenses um going to casino
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
owners um I don't know I it's not going
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
to be in the Bill maybe it can be in the
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
rules I'm not quite sure but I'm I have
 
00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
my doubts about it's kind of
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
discriminatory isn't it I live in
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester discrimination okay in
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester and no I don't I
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
mean I don't like casinos and I don't
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
trust the owners of the casinos and let
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
that be known that's it okay but the
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you um representative I think
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%

00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%

pusc thank you Mr

chair
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
um this is the third cannabis bill I
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
have seen in the
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
last three
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
years two years uh the first two
 
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis Bills take up a 4 in binder in
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
my office with all the Amendments all
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
the changes all the
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
updates uh so far uh this bill has only
 
00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
taken up
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
about an inch and a half in a three-inch
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
binder maybe that's
 
00:54:21.359 --> 00:54:23.150 align:start position:0%
binder maybe that's
success

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
success
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
um I can and will support this
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
bill uh it's taken a lot for me and a
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
lot of thought uh and a lot of
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
changes because initially I would never
 
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
ever vote to pass a cannabis bill I'm a
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
Vietnam veteran I've seen what happened
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
back in the day when guys would get
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
stoned at night go out on the patrol the
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
next day day and wind up with a bullet
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
in their
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
head if that doesn't scare living crap
 
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
out of you nothing
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
does but I've changed even though the
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
Cannabis today is like 80 times more
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
strong than what we had in the
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
70s I will be supporting this build
 
00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
because so far this is the best thing
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
I've seen and it makes its way over on
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall and it gives
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
the folks over there a good starting
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
point to work
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
with and that's it for
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
now okay so representative post we're
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
still waiting for her she's I guess
 
00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.750 align:start position:0%
still waiting for her she's I guess
she's

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
she's
 
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.309 --> 00:55:49.319 align:start position:0%
next thank you Mr
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I appreciate all the hours
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
of work that everyone has put into this
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
Bill and there are indeed uh very good
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
changes and improvements in it however
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the fact that it is
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
still illegal
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
federally and to make that could be just
 
00:56:10.349 --> 00:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
this week you know that could supposed
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
to change this week oh well it it is
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
right now so it's it's going to
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
definitely affect my vote right now this
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
minute uh so therefore by having the
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
state run it it essentially makes the
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
state into a drug dealer in my opinion
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
and uh so for that reason I would
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
continue to be a no vote and I love
 
00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:42.390 align:start position:0%
continue to be a no vote and I love
Groundhog

00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
Day yes represent
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um this bill has several
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
bitter pills for me as well um I would
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
have much preferred the free market
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
approach as several other um members of
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
the committee have
 
00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
discussed but uh my main goal with
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
regard to can cannabis bills and I've
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
seen quite a few as well uh is to stop
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
um uh subjecting people to criminal
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
prosecution for marijuana and to stop uh
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
giving people criminal records for
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
marijuana uh and as my main goal and I
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
think rep representative L has done a
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful job um in finding uh
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
compromises that will satisfy the
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
largest numbers of people and I really
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
thank her uh so I also will support this
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
bill okay um so that leaves me and um I
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
will be supporting this bill and I would
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
be supporting it on the atttention is
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
that uh we are so far away from when
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
we're actually going to be selling
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
and that I want to get the ball
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
rolling and not that that the term
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
rolling has other implications but I I
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
truly believe that that um the concept
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
whether we have you know State Stores or
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
franchises or agency stores or the free
 
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.309 align:start position:0%
franchises or agency stores or the free
market

00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
um the the problem of the free market is
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
that if you don't have controls over it
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
like Maine um it it really is it it's
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
seemingly totally out of control over in
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
that state but having said that I'm what
 
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
I do acutely am aware of is that you
 
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:44.440 align:start position:0%
before you can even have a stores you've
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
got to have cultivators that have grown
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
it and that ain't happening for over a
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
year to make to make that happen
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
probably two years
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
so at that case that will be at least
 
00:58:59.559 --> 00:59:00.390 align:start position:0%
so at that case that will be at least
one

00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
election so that we can have plenty of
 
00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
chance to revisit any of these things um
 
00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
and so therefore it's at least make take
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
that first baby step to get forward is
 
00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh is is passing this this legislation
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
and that's why why I will support
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
it okay so uh who would like to make a
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
first

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:03:06.309 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
I all right so which bill is this one I
 
01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
I can't seem to find it it's and what's
 
01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:14.119 align:start position:0%
this one about as a co-sponsor I think
 
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to kill
 
01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:20.359 align:start position:0%
it I I can read the title guys so this
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
is the one that we're trying to change
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh the the language was incorrect
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
and after discussion we even the sponsor
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm a co-sponsor we decided we
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
should just itl it but basically the
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
idea was to try to
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
make the language did the opposite of
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
what what the goal was which was to try
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
to make more specialty beers regular
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
beers but I kind of did the reverse the
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
way it was written and it turns out it
 
01:03:43.839 --> 01:03:44.750 align:start position:0%
way it was written and it turns out it
was

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
maybe not the problem we thought it was
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
okay so this is one of the bills that I
 
01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
was I I missed that day is
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
that um is this maybe maybe a maybe
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%

at that time yeah yeah okay yeah all
 
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:03.400 align:start position:0%

01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
and the reason being was at one point in
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
time Growers was a really major thing
 
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
and it's and right now Growlers are um
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
they're not it's just not popular
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
anymore and so the issue just so
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
everybody remembers and I'm sorry I
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't was n here for this bill when we
 
01:10:59.310 --> 01:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
did it that day the issue was that that
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
a when someone shows in with somebody
 
01:11:01.719 --> 01:11:03.149 align:start position:0%
a when someone shows in with somebody
else's

01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
else's
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
Growler and says and and I want you to
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
feel feel it that well what happens if
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
that person doesn't do take good care
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
with that growler you know turns into to
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
be a bad beer or does something wrong to
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
it and someone else drinks it and say oh
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
my God that stuff is poison how you know
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
you know and starts you know posting on
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
Facebook that that you know the
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
bad beer when when it was simply could
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
have been somebody else's beer or could
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
you know whatever issues so generally um
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
Brewers have been opposed to it is any
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
Brewer here have any we don't even have
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
any c of Brewers okay so they didn't
 
01:11:41.229 --> 01:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
even show up on this okay so like you
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
say in the old days they would all show
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
up and and overwhelmingly tell us not to
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
pass it right so um but at this point
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
it's they're less and less important in
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
terms of what now it's everybody it's
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
more about going in and tasting and
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
drinking and inside the facility which
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
is brings up a whole another set of
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
problems that we have with beverage
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers but uh otherwise you know
 
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
it's people want the product they want
 
01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
it in a can so okay so uh is there any
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment for this one no
 
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
yes not being an expert on Growlers or
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
anything at least I know what they are
 
01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
in in my town I see them being sold the
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
container is being sold all over the
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
place you're saying that it's not common
 
01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
anymore I'm saying is yeah the idea of
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
of people going in and getting a growler
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
filled is is less and less happening
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's not if you were to ask a beverage
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer which of course we don't
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
have any in the room um but you know the
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
only person the only one close to is
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
scotshire and he doesn't want Growlers
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
because they they distribute and they
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't distribute Growers so but um in
 
01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
Growlers are just it's it's it was a
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
phenomenon at one point in time was
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
really cool it was you know that was
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
when it came when we first started out
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
with custom beverage manufacturers it
 
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
was very you know was absolutely Growers
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
was a part of their business um and but
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
now less and less so so I mean the fact
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
that they're willing to you know the
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
scheme of things that they're they're
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're obviously don't care
 
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.390 align:start position:0%
they're obviously don't care
anymore

01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
so but okay the motion
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh who's going to make the motion who
 
01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
wants to carry this forward you want to
 
01:13:28.990 --> 01:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
John L to
 
01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.990 align:start position:0%
John L to
pass

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.910 align:start position:0%
pass
okay

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative pus second
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative hunt moves a to
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
pass any discussion on the motion of a
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
Growlers this will allow this will be
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to refill a growler that's not
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
yours and that's up today and it's
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
enabling they can still say no
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
exactly they can say no we we don't we
 
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
don't trust
 
01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
you somebody else's bot
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
though but the the crazy thing is you
 
01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
would say is well you want somebody
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
walks in a Growler and you go well you
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
sure you how do we know how clean it is
 
01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
so firsthand I saw how they clean a
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
growler they pour some poisonous stuff
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
in it it probably has
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
p and they shake it all about and they
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
rinse it out and it's
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
clean so might be one of the reasons why
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
people don't drink Growlers
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
anymore reusable Growlers
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh next one is
 
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
1702 oh I'm sorry okay all those in
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
favor of to pass to pass on 1334 four
 
01:14:58.110 --> 01:14:58.120 align:start position:0%
please say I I those opposed so moved
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
seven is zip okay
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
1702 okay
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
1702 uh relative to the oversight of
 
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission funding and repealing
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission fund
 
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
representative pusc wants to move
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate yes I
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
do is a there an amendment Mr chairman
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
was going around for the bill if anybody
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
would to consider OTP on this bill but
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay which took care it's right on your
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
desk right beside you there I just
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
passed it around representative Maguire
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay so you want to present your
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment yeah you want to present your
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment then certainly uh what this
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
does is a very simple thing it just
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
moves the uh the the alcohol treatment
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
fund from the liquor fund to the general
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
fund uh the most everybody that showed
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
up to testify against this bill spoke
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
about the liquor fund the treatment fund
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
what this does is it just keeps the fund
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
because if we were to take it out it
 
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
would basically do away with the fund
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
this just keeps it but moves it to the
 
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
general fund if we're going to move the
 
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
revenues to the general fund this moves
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the liquor treatment fund it
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
keeps the treatment fund at the 5%
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
funding and just moves it to the general
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
fund okay but this is only section one
 
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill so you're you're keeping the
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill the rest of the bill
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
would be kept yep just amend you really
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
want to move everything yeah into that's
 
01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.030 align:start position:0%
want to move everything yeah into that's
the

01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
intent so just so you know that whole
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
discussion about moving it from the
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
liquor fund to the general fund the the
 
01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
the big thing I heard when that was
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
going on from the people who spoke on it
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
and I got one year okay was that and now
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
you're making the funding totally part
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the general budget yeah and so
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
whereas under our current system it's
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
locked into to a fixed percentage of
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
from what the Liquor Commission is
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
putting in there and you're now making
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
it vulnerable to
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
be lowered or raised but the thing is it
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
by the whim of the legislature yeah
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
there but there's no guarantee that they
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
get the 5% anyways because they've
 
01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
suspended funding most of the years so
 
01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't gotten the 5
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
per. so this is does no difference to
 
01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
what's been going on now it just he
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
suspending of the funding no there's
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
many years they did not get the 5% oh
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
that well that's back when we were
 
01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
having R even recently so how far is
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
recent so how long has it been since
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
funded okay so um from someone from the
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
finance committee you guys when you cut
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
the funding and you just did it
 
01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the statute now I'm
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
looking at you mark yes yes I'm looking
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
at you now yes I'm looking at you now as
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
someone who said on the finance Comm you
 
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
come up to the mic when you sat on the
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
finance committee how how uh in terms of
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
the statutory requirement that it was
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to the general the liquor
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
fund but you you uh the wisdom of the
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
finance committee over the last couple
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
years you actually
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
didn't have that funding go through the
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
liquor fund or you you said
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding this I assume you must
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
have done this in house bill to you
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
would made the cuts and move the no Mr
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
chair that's not where the problem is
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay the problem is not with the the
 
01:18:41.310 --> 01:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee it is not with the
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee the problem is with
 
01:18:48.189 --> 01:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission as you will see
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
from the material that was given to
 
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
everyone The Liquor Commission has not
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
honored a series of its
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
obligations that the
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
legislature asked the Liquor Commission
 
01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
to do when the liquor okay we're not
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
we're not testifying so you're you're at
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
this point you don't want to answer my
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
question I gu I will answer it I can
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
tell you my question is how could they
 
01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
not if it says liquor fund how could it
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
be that we had in past years not gone to
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
the full Prof 5% who made that decision
 
01:19:27.149 --> 01:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission that's my point
 
01:19:29.709 --> 01:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission made that point
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
when made that decision when the Liquor
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
Commission became uh uh free of the fund
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
well it when it became free uh of being
 
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
a regular state agency so they could go
 
01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
out and make millions for us they took
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
on full responsibility in fiscal year 16
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
even you know they they paid
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
1.7% 17 1.7% 18 3.4 I can go through all
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
the the numbers but you have just want
 
01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
to know the Dynamics of how this all
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
happened the Liquor Commission refused
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
to honor their obligation just as the
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is obliged under the
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
law to every day put into I have an
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
amendment for that bill I have Amendment
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
for that statute and I have an amendment
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
that will change that to 30 days which
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
is what the current pattern in practice
 
01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
is now so I'm just so yes so you are I
 
01:20:30.950 --> 01:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
so you are your Amendment then would
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
take a step to have the Liquor
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
Commission come into compliance with
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
state law by changing the law correct
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
not by requiring The Liquor Commission
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that even that
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
everyone understood that one daily made
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
no sense whatsoever because it varies
 
01:20:53.310 --> 01:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
from day to day
 
01:20:54.910 --> 01:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
and there could be running funds and end
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
months going in that it had always been
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
p as a matter of fact when the statue
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
was first created they were paying on a
 
01:21:02.239 --> 01:21:03.990 align:start position:0%
was first created they were paying on a
quarterly

01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
quarterly
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
basis they violated the statue right
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
from the get-go then then then they made
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
it to monthly when the current fiscal
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
off CFO was in there uh he made it
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
monthly and it has been monthly for
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
several years and yes I will change the
 
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
statute because daily makes absolutely
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
no sense whatsoever um did he or did The
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission remember to tell
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
either the controller or the treasurer
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire what they
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
were going to do if you're going to make
 
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
this about a litness test on the
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner if the chairman if that's
 
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
what you want to turn this bill into
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's not fair you know that is not
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
fair Mr chairman you know you're not
 
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
going did he tell her or tell him
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
whoever was yes be you said that they
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
never did it they were required by law
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
the treasurer expected it when you look
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
at the management letters that have come
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
when you look at the communication from
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
the treasurer and from the controller
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
they were not in compliance if they're
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
going to be in compliance I think that's
 
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
fabulous I think that's great let's all
 
01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
do let let them be in compliance good
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
but don't for a moment M Mr chair think
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
that you're going to get me to say oh my
 
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
my I'm not going to you know say what
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
what has been verified by those people
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
the state legislature has asked to be in
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
charge great okay representative
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
burrow yeah I just wanted to respond to
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
one thing that you said Mr chair was
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
that to make it monthly that's not going
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
to change the fact that they've not been
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
putting in the 5% no that's just a side
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
she she that was a side issue she okay
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
but but what I want to know is what do
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
we do to ensure that I mean if it is
 
01:22:52.390 --> 01:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
going to stay the way it is now how do
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
we we how do we ensure compliance why is
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
it not being complied what do we need to
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
do to make ensure that happens so for
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
someone can uh can you tell us how it
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
could who who was in charge when it got
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
cut in the first place or who who who
 
01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
who in the finance committee thought it
 
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
was okay to take to have less money come
 
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
in you're saying that the The Liquor
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
Commission didn't do it and you didn't
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
tell them that not what I said this is
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
the whole point I was I was on the
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
finance committee correct when the
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
decision was made to free The Liquor
 
01:23:30.270 --> 01:23:30.280 align:start position:0%
Commission from the restraints of State
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
regulation right and they became you
 
01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
know independent and off on their own
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
they then made a series of
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
decisions with which were in violation
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the current law and all that the the
 
01:23:49.709 --> 01:23:49.719 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is not in the state
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise he would be here all he's
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
asking and all all he's asked all along
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
is that the Liquor Commission comply
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
with the law that's all that I agree so
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
what so assuming that they're right now
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
they are now in compliance with funding
 
01:24:06.669 --> 01:24:06.679 align:start position:0%
the liquor fund is that correct at the
 
01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
moment yes you might want to find out
 
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
when they made that decision at this
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
point the only other issue we know that
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
is not being complied by the
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
commission is this one day versus 30
 
01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
days and the commission is saying is 30
 
01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
days makes perfect good sense everyone
 
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
thinks that 30 days is the right number
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
I maybe you think it really should be
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
daily rather than 30 days or are you uh
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
saying that if we amend that that
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
statute and bring it to 30 days that
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to bring them in
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
compliance I don't know whether that
 
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing or a bad thing to
 
01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
me it sounds like what you're doing is
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
saying if there's been a bad procedure
 
01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
rather than change to a good procedure
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
will just make it legal to be bad but it
 
01:25:02.350 --> 01:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
is not the only problem in this bill Mr
 
01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
chair okay um and and there's
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
documentation there's another thing that
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
they're in violation of other than the
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
um in the LBA management
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
letter in 2020 said there is no formal
 
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
risk assessment process which everyone
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
in this room knows is essential the
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
commission responded that they are
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
actively in the process of creating a
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
formal internal audit two years later
 
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
the LBA said exactly the same thing and
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission responded with
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
exactly the same language they will it
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
it is complex they will they will figure
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
out what to do they are free of the
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
normal constraints and they are acting
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
in a way that shows they do not honor
 
01:25:58.510 --> 01:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the law and they've
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
done it in situation after situation
 
01:26:03.629 --> 01:26:03.639 align:start position:0%
great thank you very
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
much you don't really mean thank you Mr
 
01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
chair I am always we've known each other
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
way too long I know thank you very much
 
01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.149 align:start position:0%
way too long I know thank you very much
representative

01:26:15.149 --> 01:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
spear I I've listened to both sides of
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
this thing now quite a bit but
 
01:26:24.910 --> 01:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
there are laws that they have to follow
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
and so there's procedures that we can do
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they follow those laws
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
we can do things about that by beating
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
him on the head or whatever it is that
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
we can do but last week I saw the
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
finance committee do something that was
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
so egregious that I would never give
 
01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
them anything and as a result of that I
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
would never move this fund into the
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
finance committee because you don't
 
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.470 align:start position:0%
finance committee because you don't
deserve

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.270 align:start position:0%
deserve
it

01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
okay if you're talking about if you're
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
talking about the bill um that the
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
chairman just
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
waved oh absolutely and I would suggest
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
to you that you go back to
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
representative burrow and her suggestion
 
01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
about to think about who's going to be
 
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
in the chairs in the
 
01:27:13.149 --> 01:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
future thank you very much you want me
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
to leave now yes please oh you have a
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
question for her okay representative
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
Gibbs was next um well I actually um
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
have a comment so if representative
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
buroughs uh has a question maybe she
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
should go first and then I'll make my
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
comment okay thank you for taking my
 
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
question so okay so I have the same
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
concern UDA this hasn't been happening
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
and then this year they put the 5% in it
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't been by law they're required to
 
01:27:42.870 --> 01:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
do it but it hasn't happened so what do
 
01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
we do to make it happen I know you I I
 
01:27:46.750 --> 01:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
think a lot of us are concerned about
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
moving it to the general fund because it
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
might not go where we want it to go so
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
do you see any solution other than to
 
01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:55.719 align:start position:0%
send it to the general fund to get them
 
01:27:57.870 --> 01:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
to do what's required by
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
law um I see solution but um because I
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
have I have looked with great respect
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
for many years on the chair of the
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee if I suggest my my
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
solution I'm afraid that he will lose
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
any feeling of love and affection he has
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
for me and that is to say they have not
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
honored their obligation as an
 
01:28:31.390 --> 01:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
Enterprise agency they haven't and I
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
mean and I and I say it in situation
 
01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
after situation they look at how much
 
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
money they have borrowed borrowed what
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're paying in interest saying that
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know because they're expanding but
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
they're not bringing in any more Revenue
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
they're not bringing in more Revenue so
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they be limited a little
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
little bit in all their new spending
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
until they're able to bring in more
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue I don't know why they're not
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
bringing in new Revenue whatever the
 
01:29:03.109 --> 01:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
reason is that's their problem they
 
01:29:06.189 --> 01:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
chose to do to do that but when you look
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
at how much that Revenue they brought in
 
01:29:11.709 --> 01:29:11.719 align:start position:0%
and you compare that with how much they
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
are borrowing and having to pay interest
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
on and they're free to do that because
 
01:29:19.550 --> 01:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
they are an Enterprise operation they're
 
01:29:23.830 --> 01:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
not a regular state agency I find that
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
very troubling so it is how the Liquor
 
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
Commission has been managed and there
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
might be perfectly legitimate reasons
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
let's find out what the legitimate
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
reasons are there might be things that
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
we should be doing in the legislature to
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
make it easier for the Liquor Commission
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to generate more Revenue but
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
right now we are they are the money
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's coming in to the Liquor
 
01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.750 align:start position:0%
that's coming in to the Liquor
Commission

01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:29:55.950 --> 01:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
is not going to pay education it's not
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to pay um for to address drug
 
01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
abuse it's paying to pay off it's going
 
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
to pay off the money that they've
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
borrowed and it's not good management
 
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
and the one thing I do know about the
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
chair of the Commerce Committee among
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
many others is that good management
 
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
matters to him and I think you ought to
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
take a look at that uh and figure out
 
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
where you want to go what what the prime
 
01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor wanted to do in this bill and is
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
to say let's find a way to make sure
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
that the money goes to the
 
01:30:38.189 --> 01:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol whatever that full name is you
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
know there's so many words in it I don't
 
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
remember at all um but the money should
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
go to it and it wasn't until there was a
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
Kur fluffle about this that suddenly
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
they put the right amount of money in
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
because somebody body was watching now
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
somebody ought to watch about how much
 
01:30:58.109 --> 01:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
money they're borrowing as compared with
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
how much money they're taking in and
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's documented the control documents
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
the treasurer these are independent
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
people the legislative budget analyst
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
documents it it's not made up Mr chair
 
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's there it's true I noticed that
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
no one from The Liquor Commission
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
testified when this bill was presented
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
and and I don't blame them I wouldn't
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
have wanted to testify either because
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
those numbers they couldn't have argued
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
with okay okay all right representative
 
01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.310 align:start position:0%
with okay okay all right representative
Gibbs

01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
Gibbs
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
is thank you um
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh I have the greatest um respect for
 
01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
the knowledge and experience of the past
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
speaker uh but I do think that it is
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
riskier to put this fund money into the
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
general fund uh than to have it
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
something that the Liquor Commission is
 
01:32:00.109 --> 01:32:00.119 align:start position:0%
is required to put in I know that this
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
is the first year that they've put in
 
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
the full 5% in some years but it's my
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that each year the fund
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
did get something and knowing what can
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
happen in budget
 
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
negotiations uh I'm afraid that if this
 
01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
were put into the general fund uh that
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
would be much riskier than having it uh
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
under the control of the Liquor
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
Commission because if it were in the
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
general fund and subject to full budget
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
nothing okay uh anybody else from the
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
committee so I would like to make a
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
motion of inexpedient to legislate
 
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
actually no have to do the I want to do
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
have to do the amendment first did we
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
actually move the amendment I think we
 
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
were just discussing it actually I think
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%

01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer retail
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
outlet so this bill would allow them to
 
01:43:09.390 --> 01:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
have their on premises
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
license either at their manufacturing
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
facility or the retail
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
outlet so I believe um represent this is
 
01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:21.639 align:start position:0%
the Madam label
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
this label originally wanted that
 
01:43:26.189 --> 01:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
offsite location the the wine
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer retail manufacturer wanted
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
the offsite location that so we're now
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
we're saying is that that that
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturing can occur at either one
 
01:43:40.950 --> 01:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's not locked into the on premises
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
license that they're entitled to can be
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
on the premises of the manufacturing
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
facility or the beverage manufacturer
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
retail outlet yeah right okay because
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
there there has been circumstances where
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing facilities are not
 
01:43:59.229 --> 01:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
zoned properly for a restaurant they're
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
not they can't they don't have the means
 
01:44:03.589 --> 01:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
to be able to have that so if they were
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
to have the retail outlet which is an
 
01:44:08.109 --> 01:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
add-on to the license they would be able
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
to have their on premises license there
 
01:44:13.629 --> 01:44:13.639 align:start position:0%
their restaurant license there and this
 
01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
similarly this language is is found in
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
the beverage manufacturer license that's
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's what where representative svin is
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
referencing the beverage manufacturer we
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
already G we already gave it to them but
 
01:44:28.669 --> 01:44:28.679 align:start position:0%
we just now we're going back to the
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
original uh entity which was
 
01:44:33.790 --> 01:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
wine okay anybody have a problem with
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
this bill no just to clarify you're
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
gonna have you now they can have a
 
01:44:43.589 --> 01:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
retail store and um that sells I mean
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
that oh the retail outlet will be able
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%
to serve liquor and just like wine wine
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
wine not liquor that would be a liquor
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
store so yeah yeah right right so we
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
can't do the liquor store but the wine
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
is uh they're able to add on an
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
additional license to have a retail
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
outlet where they sell their wine only
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
their wine right so that could be a
 
01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:11.719 align:start position:0%
separate location so so now now they can
 
01:45:15.870 --> 01:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
have both right onsite and in a retail
 
01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
they're already able to have onsite
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
right both but they're right now they're
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
only allowed to have their restaurant
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
license that they're entitled to under
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
the statute on their manufacturing
 
01:45:29.910 --> 01:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
facility this would allow them to choose
 
01:45:31.709 --> 01:45:31.719 align:start position:0%
whether they want that one license on
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing facility or the retail
 
01:45:36.350 --> 01:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
outlet which could be it two separate
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
locations but it doesn't unless we make
 
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
that change that I wrote my notes on
 
01:45:43.709 --> 01:45:43.719 align:start position:0%
right correct okay for the wine we
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
haven't not address the beverage
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturer we haven't addressed them
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
yet this all started out with leel
 
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
wanted had that big facility on in in
 
01:45:55.629 --> 01:45:55.639 align:start position:0%
Amherst there and then she wanted to
 
01:45:58.109 --> 01:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
have a in one of the outlets I think it
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
was the marac outlet she wanted to put a
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
put a a location inside there okay and
 
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
we allowed her and that and that that
 
01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
was a whole Hua all right because now
 
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
we're having separate location and that
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
she was going to have be allowed to sell
 
01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
wine in that location it had to be only
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
her wine originally the commission's
 
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
position is no they need to make wine
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
inside that facility and everybody says
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
no we don't think that's probably a
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
really good idea to them to have a
 
01:46:31.709 --> 01:46:31.719 align:start position:0%
little wine making business inside the a
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
mall you know and so that that the
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
conclusion was we'll give them the right
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
to have that other location now we're
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
saying is that location can actually be
 
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
an off- premise license on premise licy
 
01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
which means a restaurant it could be a
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
restaurant on premise
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
lcy so I have a a a question is this
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
just for one individual that came to you
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
no be all wine there's we got other wine
 
01:47:01.870 --> 01:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
people here right no this is this is a a
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
request that's been made several times I
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
guess we don't have any wine people
 
01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
here I see is so the question is are we
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
changing my Mr chair Bing people doing
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
here my question is is my note does that
 
01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
need to be added on to it I something it
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
does so the question is is that should
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
we also
 
01:47:24.709 --> 01:47:24.719 align:start position:0%
add for beverage manufacturers the same
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
privilege um and is what you're posing
 
01:47:30.149 --> 01:47:30.159 align:start position:0%
the question and sort of like uh let's
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
let let's nip this in the bud before one
 
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
of them comes and ask us to do that so
 
01:47:34.830 --> 01:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
that would require just a little bit of
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would requireed
 
01:47:39.149 --> 01:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that correct but you're
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
changing 17812 not 1788 in that instance
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
in that case so but 178 so therefore
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
right now do we
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
allow an individual right now beverage
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers don't have that privilege
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
they do not have this privilege that it
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
is before the committee now yeah right
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to give it to okay so
 
01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we want an amendment for to
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
add beverage manufacturer to get the
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
same privilege as this
 
01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:08.390 align:start position:0%
same privilege as this
exactly

01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
okay got it nice whose coffee was this
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%

right section six of the
 
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill and it wasn't there one other word
 
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
change somewhere else in there too that
 
01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:42.629 align:start position:0%

was

01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:36.750 align:start position:0%
 
what

01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.830 --> 01:51:44.840 align:start position:0%

01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
it's the problem is we don't have the
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
file right no we don't have the file I
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%

01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.199 --> 01:52:15.310 align:start position:0%
 
there

01:52:15.310 --> 01:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
okay just take that is this 1591 is that
 
01:52:43.229 --> 01:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
yeah this yeah this is your it's just
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
not seeing all my
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
mail this a dumb idea
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
the usually there's
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
amendments I ask because these bills all
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
these bills they ask me to put in so I
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
would have them give me the change and
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
then I would send it to ol they would
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
have it done and then normally I then
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
send it to them to make sure it's right
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%

okay so before we we before we end the
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%

everybody else is going to be okay with
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
1591 what was is that with or without
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
change what which
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
Bill where's the gief Danielle which one
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
did I add delta8 and Delta 9 I thought I
 
01:54:15.069 --> 01:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
one right
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
Del right so it was supposed to in this
 
01:54:20.199 --> 01:54:26.950 align:start position:0%
Del right so it was supposed to in this
bill

01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
right and whatever happened to
 
01:54:32.589 --> 01:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
it all right I'll be better prepared
 
01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
next time okay so just so we know we're
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
going to remove this paragraph section
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
six and add a new section six because
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's the last one I think or maybe we
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
were going to add the Banning of the
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
main continue the ban oh no we were
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
going to add
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
what what was the amendment going to be
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
so the amendment was we originally
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
talked about the amendment will make
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
Delta 8 Delta 9 Delta 10 the authorized
 
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
products 21 plus right right they will
 
01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
also require lenses to comply with the
 
01:55:12.510 --> 01:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
statute that puts the parameters on um
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
the the range of Delta we could not put
 
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
it under a license that you needed a
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
license to sell it because it's in the
 
01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:23.320 align:start position:0%
definition of hemp and I don't think
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
that was something we all had the energy
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
to tackle right now was regulating hemp
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
so the he just left the room the hemp
 
01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
the hemp gr so the amendment makes it 21
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
plus there's penalties for selling under
 
01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
to someone under the age of 21 uh
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
possession and then it requires licenses
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
for us to comply with the Delta
 
01:55:51.069 --> 01:55:51.079 align:start position:0%
statutes okay
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:58.669 --> 01:55:58.679 align:start position:0%
that you're yeah because you get to sell
 
01:55:58.679 --> 01:56:00.030 align:start position:0%
that you're yeah because you get to sell
it

01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
now I'm sure you'll be okay I was more
 
01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:09.159 --> 01:56:15.390 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:56:15.390 --> 01:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
right oh they have a
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
senate they have bill they already have
 
01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
a bill to extend the
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
sunset oh they were going to extend the
 
01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
sunset we can so what would you rather
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
do extend the sunset or would you rather
 
01:56:31.079 --> 01:56:37.669 align:start position:0%
do extend the sunset or would you rather
have

01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
us that's fine okay fine we'll wait for
 
01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
that then okay all right so never mind
 
01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:45.320 align:start position:0%
about the Delta 8 Delta 9 and Delta 10
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
now we have a Delta 10 all Del all
 
01:56:53.149 --> 01:56:53.159 align:start position:0%
Deltas all deltas Delta Dent right okay
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
all right but but just section six is
 
01:56:57.790 --> 01:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
what we're going to take out okay so
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
sorry that you guys had to wait here to
 
01:57:02.350 --> 01:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
get to that place but at least now you
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to wait for that one okay so
 
01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
are we gonna so we have one more I want
 
01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
to take up and then and then we I think
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
we've had enough of this okay the one we
 
01:57:14.350 --> 01:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
want to take up
 
01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
is uh 1380 is that correct 1 1380 right
 
01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
1380 uh we gonna take up um oops yards
 
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
15 um we we could talk about his but I
 
01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
want to do 1380 because I don't know how
 
01:57:36.750 --> 01:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
long this conversation is going to last
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
okay so um what we'll do is um I guess I
 
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
can paint the picture here what we have
 
01:57:48.229 --> 01:57:48.239 align:start position:0%
here was a
 
01:57:53.069 --> 01:57:53.079 align:start position:0%
situation um uh that
 
01:57:57.030 --> 01:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
um for better for worse
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
the solution to a problem was that in
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
our statutes uh we have this um three
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
tier requirement it doesn't they don't
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
call three tier but it's basically a
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
separation of involvement of one
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
business versus the other business of
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
the three different tiers and remind
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
everybody the three tiers is
 
01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:19.990 align:start position:0%
everybody the three tiers is
manufacturing

01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
Distributing and then and then retailing
 
01:58:26.069 --> 01:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
or which can be um on or off premise
 
01:58:29.950 --> 01:58:29.960 align:start position:0%
licy the issue uh was that we had that
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
you couldn't if you own one you can't
 
01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
own another you're that that everybody's
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
kind of separated into their to their
 
01:58:38.159 --> 01:58:41.430 align:start position:0%
kind of separated into their to their
Silo

01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
um better for worse and I and I the best
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
offense I can say this all happened
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
before me I know you guys think I've
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
been here all all forever but that the
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislature in its wisdom decided to um
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
create a concept called a brew
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
Hub and a brew Hub is a total violation
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the three- tier system because it's a
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that distributes to itself
 
01:59:11.870 --> 01:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
deliver takes it from one side of the
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
room to the other side of the room and
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
then sells it on as an on premise
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
licy um the other things that they was
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
in the legislature is they required it
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
to it had a cap 2500 barrels it had um
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
it had to get a full liquor
 
01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
license so it wasn't just a a beverage
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer it was it was a it had so
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
it end up having distilled
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
drinks so it wasn't a beer and wine
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
lensey but it um I think those are the
 
01:59:48.550 --> 01:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
the most Salient items what occurred was
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
that we have some somebody who owns does
 
01:59:55.069 --> 01:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
he already own a brew do he already own
 
01:59:57.629 --> 01:59:57.639 align:start position:0%
a brew pub Brew Pub does he already own
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
a brew
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
pub does not own a brew pub now so what
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
happened was is that he um he has
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
restaurants but he would like to own a
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
brew pub and he would like to be able to
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
have uh the beer that he's brewing in
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
this beer pu to be sold in his other
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants which would be on the face
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
of it that is a violation of our our the
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
the title it's it's not three CH what do
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
we call this title it's uh no I know
 
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
title No the
 
02:00:33.550 --> 02:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
uh prohibited interests that's the key
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.189 --> 02:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
um in this issue and yes my name is on
 
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um what became uh clear
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
was issue was that that when we created
 
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
the Nano legislation which yes I was in
 
02:00:58.030 --> 02:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
the room when that happened the Nano
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
legislation which we thought we were
 
02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
just going to be little small little
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
started reppers and that they would grow
 
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
up and be big boys and be real beverage
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers it was always the theory
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
of Nanos but it didn't turn out that way
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
and it turns out that there are some
 
02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
people who are very happy being Nanos
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
and and we have like 30 40 of them and
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
lot we have a lot of Nanos
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
um and and they definitely have a lesser
 
02:01:25.390 --> 02:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
license it's a cheaper
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
license um and they have the capability
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
of one of the first legislation I did
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
which is they can self-distribute they
 
02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
you know they can be they didn't need
 
02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
Distributors they could actually a nano
 
02:01:38.990 --> 02:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
can distributor and we have a one Nano
 
02:01:42.189 --> 02:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
guy actually delivers to your house so
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
we had a
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester so in this prohibitive
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
interest concept the the fact was that
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
when we wrote the statute we of Nanos we
 
02:01:56.550 --> 02:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
didn't go over to the prohibited
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
interest and add Nano to the list at the
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
time we didn't do that because we didn't
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
never crossed our mind that that would
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
get caught up in a
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
problem the upshot was when this
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
gentleman who wants to have a um wants
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
to have he already owns these
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants he wants to create a brew
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
pub and and have that beer distributed
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh was told that he couldn't do it
 
02:02:22.069 --> 02:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
because of the prohibited interest
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
statute and they said um oh by the way
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
you could be a nano and that way you can
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
get around it and so everybody said oh
 
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea let's let him just
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
be a nano well as you might be aware the
 
02:02:38.030 --> 02:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
Senate right now has another piece of
 
02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
legislation that they're sending over to
 
02:02:44.069 --> 02:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
us that gets rid of Nanos repeals it and
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
instead instead we're going to have a
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
tiered system of Beverage mean
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers what you can you're you're
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
tearing and so the um what you're going
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
to hear and I will
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
invite the the party who is in
 
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
opposition because because when when I
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
heard of this idea of the Brew Pub uh it
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
seemed simple enough to me to um just
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
simply you know let the Brew Pub um
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
except it which says 5,000 barrels and
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
that really should be 2500 if you're
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the actual bill but anyway so
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
the issue then was that um the beer
 
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
distributors are saying we're trampling
 
02:03:30.589 --> 02:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
on this prohibited interest statute uh
 
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
that we're violating federal law and uh
 
02:03:35.550 --> 02:03:35.560 align:start position:0%
who knows what nightmares we were
 
02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
creating by doing this and that why
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we just do something that yes
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
I'm been around long enough to know this
 
02:03:46.549 --> 02:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
trick and that is you pass the law and
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
then and then you wait 10 minutes when
 
02:03:51.229 --> 02:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
you pass the bill you say it's effective
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
at a certain time and then you pass
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
another law that's effective 10 minutes
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
later okay so you would say July 1st mid
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
at midnight and then you would say July
 
02:04:06.030 --> 02:04:06.040 align:start position:0%
1st at
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
1210 and that way U we could allow this
 
02:04:15.790 --> 02:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
gentleman who wants to have this uh uh
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
Brew Pub uh to uh to be uh be a nano not
 
02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
a brute Pub be a nano and then have uh
 
02:04:25.229 --> 02:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
he can distribute it to all the
 
02:04:28.470 --> 02:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants as a self-d distributor um
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
instead of having a brew pub license um
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
I when I first heard about where I
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't really aware of too much of the
 
02:04:39.149 --> 02:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
detail of the Nano I I guess I did know
 
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
about the Nano problem but it didn't it
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
always felt for me personally that when
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
we do legislation we normally know that
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
everything we do here as mother mayi
 
02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
that everything's illegal until we say
 
02:04:55.709 --> 02:04:55.719 align:start position:0%
it's legal and so if you know where how
 
02:04:59.149 --> 02:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
do I feel about a brw hub Distributing
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
to other restaurants that are owned by
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
that same facility and the classic
 
02:05:08.030 --> 02:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
example I would always say is
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
well common man's got his own beer but
 
02:05:14.030 --> 02:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
they don't make it they they license it
 
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
from a beverage manufacturer and puts
 
02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
that label on it and then
 
02:05:21.149 --> 02:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know if it's distributed
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
or or self-distributed to Sonny those to
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
they probably take it in and fill a
 
02:05:26.350 --> 02:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
truck and they take it over to the
 
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
common man's warehouse and Common Man
 
02:05:30.549 --> 02:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
then distributes all the stuff but
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's legal because we pass a statue
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
that allowed for contract brew and as a
 
02:05:37.390 --> 02:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
matter of fact we have a bill in this
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
year to tighten up or add the confusing
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
of uh of um terms of the C that kind of
 
02:05:49.229 --> 02:05:49.239 align:start position:0%
Brewer that Brewer versus uh doesn't
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
matter so the issue now at at hand
 
02:05:59.310 --> 02:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
is what is a brw pub is a brew pub a
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant that happens to make beer and
 
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
so therefore they want to distribute
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
that beer to all their locations or is
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
it a beverage
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and therefore it would be a
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
violation for them to sell beer to their
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
other locations representative Wells
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh I'm going to defer
 
02:06:25.549 --> 02:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
to all of your great knowledge in this
 
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
how is this different from 1076 once
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
it's amended to include beverage
 
02:06:36.549 --> 02:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturers isn't this basically the
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
same issue what 10 what's 1076 was wine
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
but we're going to add so um I'm getting
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
1076 is is really about
 
02:06:51.310 --> 02:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh it is true that they're talking about
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
an on- premise license okay and I would
 
02:06:56.350 --> 02:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
say that that was actually one of the
 
02:06:59.149 --> 02:06:59.159 align:start position:0%
Battlegrounds on whether why we allow
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
that legislation so what's different
 
02:07:04.510 --> 02:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of this
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
conversation is uh they have more than
 
02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
one restaurant they have several
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
guess

02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
guess
 
02:07:21.470 --> 02:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
y so whereas that bill was only one
 
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
location and believe you me that was a
 
02:07:25.149 --> 02:07:25.159 align:start position:0%
battle royale just to get to that one
 
02:07:28.430 --> 02:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
location so and and along the similar
 
02:07:31.629 --> 02:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
items here so if I I look at the three
 
02:07:33.950 --> 02:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
people did I articulate the the
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
discussion correctly okay so what we
 
02:07:38.430 --> 02:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
have here
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
just some of you might know Mike Summers
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh well because he's been here for many
 
02:07:45.109 --> 02:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
times and he represents the restaurants
 
02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and Association and this is
 
02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
obviously one of his his clients who
 
02:07:53.229 --> 02:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
would like to uh pass this bill to allow
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
his The Brew Pub for formula and in the
 
02:07:57.870 --> 02:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
back of the room and we have one person
 
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
you have not maybe seen before is a a
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
real live beer distributor who's come to
 
02:08:05.549 --> 02:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
us and of course Scot sh who you have
 
02:08:08.229 --> 02:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
seen in past so I will start with them
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
and have them come up and make the
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
argument to why you because you guys
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
never actually spoke against this bill
 
02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
in the hearing right you didn't just
 
02:08:22.430 --> 02:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
sign okay great so now is now is your
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity with half the committee here
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
to make the case for why we should do 12
 
02:08:34.430 --> 02:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
midnight and and
 
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
1201 for those I haven't met my name is
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
Joe bellavance I'm one of the owners of
 
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
bellavance Beverage uh we are a
 
02:08:41.669 --> 02:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
distributor in more the southern portion
 
02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
state and for the record I'm Scott Shire
 
02:08:46.669 --> 02:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the beer
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
distributors Association thank you for
 
02:08:51.310 --> 02:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
your time and uh this important matter
 
02:08:53.109 --> 02:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to keep this as short
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
and sweet as possible because I know
 
02:08:56.830 --> 02:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
that it's been a long day for everybody
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
especially those who thought we started
 
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
at 10 um but oh well so um here's the
 
02:09:07.470 --> 02:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
essence of it we and the State Liquor
 
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
Commission and they can correct me if
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong classify a brew pub as a
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
manufactur so the manufacturer exists in
 
02:09:19.229 --> 02:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
the middle one of the tiers right the F
 
02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
this is the first tier actually
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer sometimes referred to as a
 
02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:25.639 align:start position:0%
supplier or a brewer or a wine maker or
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
a distiller so they exist within that
 
02:09:31.790 --> 02:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
category the middle tier is distributors
 
02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:32.709 align:start position:0%
category the middle tier is distributors
or

02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and the other tier is the
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
retailers which can be a restaurant they
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
could also be a hotel and they could
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
also be a grocery store so that
 
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
separation exists to this day and
 
02:09:49.629 --> 02:09:49.639 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
illustration of the Brew Pub and the
 
02:09:55.149 --> 02:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
trampling of the three- tier system is
 
02:09:58.270 --> 02:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
not entirely inaccurate but I will say
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
that that Brew Pub does hold a
 
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturer's license they have retail
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
Privileges and distribution privileges
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
that go with that manufacturer's license
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
so that's the real difference they're
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
within one
 
02:10:14.069 --> 02:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
category versus within two now in the
 
02:10:18.390 --> 02:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
case of Mr summers's member he has
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
retail licenses which are restaurants so
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
they exist in the retail tier and now he
 
02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
wants to open up a brew pub which is a
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and exists in the
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer tier this would be the
 
02:10:32.069 --> 02:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
first time we would allow this cross
 
02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
tier ownership since before
 
02:10:39.870 --> 02:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition and this is a very important
 
02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:42.599 align:start position:0%
distinction and it's a lot more serious
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
then some might think it's not just for
 
02:10:45.199 --> 02:10:46.069 align:start position:0%
then some might think it's not just for
one

02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant but it's for the all the
 
02:10:49.549 --> 02:10:49.559 align:start position:0%
particip ipants in the industry that
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
play by the same set of rules with
 
02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
regulation uh representative hunt also
 
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
indicated correctly that the federal
 
02:10:59.350 --> 02:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
government does have a Prohibition
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
against tide house or cros tier
 
02:11:04.830 --> 02:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
ownership it's in chapter 27 of the
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
federal alcohol act and that's been
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
existence again since the repeal of
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
prohibition I'm not going to get into
 
02:11:16.830 --> 02:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
too much more detail but I will tell you
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
that sometimes
 
02:11:21.069 --> 02:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
it's more important to focus on the
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
research and the facts and the data um
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that uh you know we don't
 
02:11:30.030 --> 02:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
have good insights into this but I'd
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
refer to a study that I'm going to hand
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
out to everybody and and I'll have to
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
email this to the committee too because
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
I don't have enough copies for everybody
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
today but um I'll pass that out and um
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
I'll let Joe say a couple of words and
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.159 --> 02:11:48.669 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
and I would say that the the three- tier
 
02:11:53.229 --> 02:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
system has existed for a long time um
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
some people knock it because of its age
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
however it has worked very well you have
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
over a hundred craft breweries in the
 
02:12:03.109 --> 02:12:03.119 align:start position:0%
state right now um one of the concerns
 
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
about this bill is not so much the
 
02:12:08.549 --> 02:12:08.559 align:start position:0%
individual location um Michael runs a
 
02:12:10.310 --> 02:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
great business and if he wants to make
 
02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
beer at one of his
 
02:12:14.430 --> 02:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
locations hey that's probably not a big
 
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
deal but if you take the law as it's
 
02:12:18.669 --> 02:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
proposed to be changed
 
02:12:21.549 --> 02:12:21.559 align:start position:0%
and carry that out across multiple
 
02:12:24.549 --> 02:12:24.559 align:start position:0%
locations the concern becomes what now
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
if he only wants to sell his beer at his
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
other seven locations and the 603s and
 
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
the heners and the small breweries of
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
the world um and ourselves the products
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
that we represent those are the ones we
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
do um now are excluded from being served
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
in those accounts and he only wants to
 
02:12:44.549 --> 02:12:44.559 align:start position:0%
serve his own beers because cost
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
structures and other reasons um make
 
02:12:49.629 --> 02:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
sense so maybe that's two or three
 
02:12:51.270 --> 02:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
locations but let's look at the common
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
man that came up that's a perfect
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
example they do a contract beer right
 
02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
now what if they open their own Brewery
 
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
and across all Common Man locations now
 
02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
all those New Hampshire Brewers were
 
02:13:05.549 --> 02:13:05.559 align:start position:0%
excluded and Common Man only wanted to
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
sell the beer that they produced there
 
02:13:11.310 --> 02:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
so um it's not that farfetched if you
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
think very simply you probably all have
 
02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
your favorite restaurants you can either
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
get a Coke or a Pepsi but usually not
 
02:13:17.639 --> 02:13:18.950 align:start position:0%
get a Coke or a Pepsi but usually not
both

02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
both
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
Coker Pepsi pays for the exclusive
 
02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
rights at those restaurants and
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
therefore you only have one choice or
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
the other choice three tier does not
 
02:13:29.709 --> 02:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
allow that that's why you have over a
 
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
100 craft bries in the state why you
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
have diverse selection of beer uh at the
 
02:13:36.669 --> 02:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
various restaurants uh that we have here
 
02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
in the state and um that is our bigger
 
02:13:41.549 --> 02:13:41.559 align:start position:0%
concern is that this just isn't isolated
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
to one location but that it could be
 
02:13:46.589 --> 02:13:46.599 align:start position:0%
expanded and have Ripple effects um for
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves and for the craft Brewers in
 
02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
the state across many of these
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
restaurants and just to add to that
 
02:13:56.669 --> 02:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
quickly um we know the Michael Timothy
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
group very very well they're excellent
 
02:14:00.669 --> 02:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
partners of ours and Joe's got a good
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
personal relationship with them this is
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
important to us if it wasn't important
 
02:14:08.189 --> 02:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be having this fight but
 
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
this is changing the entire regulatory
 
02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
system and I do believe that there are
 
02:14:16.109 --> 02:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
other ways to handle this
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
without breaking this long held
 
02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
prohibition of of prohibited interest
 
02:14:23.830 --> 02:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
that that exists in the state um
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative Hunt's idea um certainly
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
is one one way to do it I think that um
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's been conversations among
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders with the Liquor Commission
 
02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
about other ways to possibly handle this
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
um but we're firmly supportive of the
 
02:14:40.229 --> 02:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
regulatory system that's provided safety
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
um access to Consumers good competition
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
for businesses and Equitable access for
 
02:14:48.990 --> 02:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
businesses of all SI sizes in beverage
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol and I think representative hunt
 
02:14:54.229 --> 02:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned it during his uh statements on
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
1633 if you don't have any control
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
things can really get out of order right
 
02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
away like in
 
02:15:03.669 --> 02:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
main so represent buo has a question I
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
just have a comment I don't think that
 
02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
would be a good business model for you
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
know restaurants to be only selling one
 
02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
beer it just wouldn't make sense to a
 
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know very successful restaurant tour
 
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
can you comment on that thanks to the
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
question I 100% agree with you it
 
02:15:25.149 --> 02:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make sense but there have been
 
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
situations in the past where
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have had their own retail
 
02:15:34.189 --> 02:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
outlets and um they control the price
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the supply of the products and
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes they drop it to knock people
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
out of out of business and then they can
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
raise the prices when they're done and I
 
02:15:42.750 --> 02:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
think that while we haven't seen that as
 
02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
much in the United States in the last 90
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
years you just have to look South of the
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
Border in Mexico or South America or
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
even in the UK to see the limits that
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
are put on the the regulatory
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
Marketplace by tide house and I I would
 
02:16:01.709 --> 02:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
just add the uh I think the economics of
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
that production obviously would bypass
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
the middle tier so there is a greater
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
gross profit on those products that um
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
the location would manufacture so
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
there's an economic incentive there um
 
02:16:15.470 --> 02:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
yes I agree consumer wise you might be
 
02:16:17.790 --> 02:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
challenged to only offer those at least
 
02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
the environment we're in
 
02:16:23.229 --> 02:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
now so
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
Joe we known each other a long time and
 
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
what was the first bill that I brought
 
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
in that we had this little mono mono
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
discussion on it was probably
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
self-distribution self-distribution
 
02:16:42.070 --> 02:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
right and once again I or no for the
 
02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
first time I was well actually the drip
 
02:16:47.709 --> 02:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
shiing law could be say I was somewhat
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
trampling on the three tier because I
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
was going across state lines with my
 
02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
trampling but that statute was trampling
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
on the three
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
tier and the compromise that we had
 
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
was that there was a limit to how much
 
02:17:09.309 --> 02:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
correct yeah so
 
02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
again if we look at this legislation and
 
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
like I say it's it shouldn't be five
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
should be 2500 because that's what you
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
know we that's the the current
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
limitation of a brew
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
Hub okay are you saying that 2500 if
 
02:17:31.589 --> 02:17:31.599 align:start position:0%
they're limited to
 
02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
2500 I mean you've done the math how
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
much money would you really make if you
 
02:17:37.469 --> 02:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
were involved in the Distributing of
 
02:17:42.709 --> 02:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
2500 barrels and so all I'm saying is is
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
this is treated this okay if they're
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
going to treat him as a beverage
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.679 --> 02:17:53.509 align:start position:0%
 
self-distributing

02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
self-distributing
 
02:17:55.950 --> 02:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
okay and what the self-d distrib law
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
what did we say that it's a th000
 
02:17:59.910 --> 02:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
barrels I'm trying to remember what for
 
02:18:02.349 --> 02:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
brw pubs it's 2500 I know but what was
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
the what did what was the bill would you
 
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
and I compromise that 30 years ago what
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
was average manufacturers yeah 10,000
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
10,000 no was 15,000 total and I think
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.549 --> 02:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
so using your comparison that a brew
 
02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
pub is a beverage
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturer I didn't a manufacturer the
 
02:18:30.559 --> 02:18:31.830 align:start position:0%
manufacturer I didn't a manufacturer the
manufacturer

02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
02:18:34.830 --> 02:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
tier okay so why shouldn't we be giving
 
02:18:39.309 --> 02:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
self-distribute it's it's not about that
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's only because he owns those other
 
02:18:47.549 --> 02:18:47.559 align:start position:0%
facilities correct okay that's the only
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
difference here right and we're worried
 
02:18:52.990 --> 02:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
about that he's going to turn into
 
02:18:56.509 --> 02:18:56.519 align:start position:0%
anheiser Bush and be a tide house and
 
02:18:57.709 --> 02:18:57.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's who we're talking about
 
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
the tigh house
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
legislation concept was worried about
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
anheiser Bush and Miller and you know
 
02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
cores maybe no we're we're not worried
 
02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
about that happening here in the state
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
what we're worried about is the
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
precedent that might be set that might
 
02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
encourage others like Amazon who owns
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
Whole Foods already or somebody else
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
getting into the business and ultimately
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
cutting out small neighborhood Family
 
02:19:23.389 --> 02:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
run businesses in the state but they can
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
only self only deliver 500 barrels I'm
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
pretty sure Amazon would think that
 
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
ain't worth the effort to buying a brew
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
pub and doing that self-distributing for
 
02:19:34.679 --> 02:19:36.110 align:start position:0%
pub and doing that self-distributing for
2500

02:19:36.110 --> 02:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
2500
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
barrels that's what I'm saying is same
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
compromise Joe same compromise we had
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
before with it's put a cap and and and
 
02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:46.599 align:start position:0%
and my memory was that you guys said to
 
02:19:49.309 --> 02:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
me was was that you don't make any money
 
02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
unless you were Distributing more than
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
that 10,000 or whatever that 5,000 that
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
number that we had agreed upon yeah I
 
02:19:58.110 --> 02:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
don't think there was a numeric value we
 
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
placed on it but we did recognize that
 
02:20:02.110 --> 02:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
there were certain small Brewers proof
 
02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
of concept that needed to have an
 
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
incubator and be able to get the public
 
02:20:08.910 --> 02:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
their be to determine whether there's
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
some commercial viability isn't 2500
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
small isn't that kind of a small you
 
02:20:16.309 --> 02:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
would I would say that 80% of the
 
02:20:19.309 --> 02:20:19.319 align:start position:0%
Brewers in the state are below 2500 so
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's a small number but
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's actually pretty 38,000 cases of
 
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
beer 12 ounce 24
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
pack and again again not if I may not to
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
get up off track but just we're talking
 
02:20:37.110 --> 02:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
about prohibited interest Clause here
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
not how much somebody can distribute
 
02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
right you know you can get multiple Brew
 
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
Pub licenses if you want to have a
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant and a manufacturer and that
 
02:20:46.990 --> 02:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
in fact is being done by people in the
 
02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
state right now multiple Brew Pub
 
02:20:51.710 --> 02:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
licenses that's a way to skin this
 
02:20:54.030 --> 02:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
cat without changing the system and
 
02:20:55.389 --> 02:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
without Crossing he would have to
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
manufacture in each one of those
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants Define manufacturer in
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
statute I I I don't want someone to have
 
02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
a a keg in the corner
 
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't we didn't remember we didn't
 
02:21:09.870 --> 02:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
like them doing that in the mall because
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
we didn't want them to have the you know
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
because you got to do some heating up
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
and we didn't think that was a good idea
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
to have
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
them bring in that high voltage wire and
 
02:21:24.270 --> 02:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
who knows with liquids and so
 
02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
um I urge you to think of some kind of
 
02:21:31.309 --> 02:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
compromise that we can do here is that's
 
02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
we have been working very Harding you
 
02:21:37.230 --> 02:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
but that I I you know now I'm speaking
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
for myself and I can't say what my other
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
committee members is but to to play the
 
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know Nano game and for for 10
 
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
minutes and then change it and say okay
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
now they're grandfathered um that is
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
really tacky and and just the idea that
 
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
we we know for well and we're getting
 
02:21:58.150 --> 02:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
rid of Nano so why would we why would we
 
02:21:59.550 --> 02:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
want them to be a nano when we know
 
02:22:01.469 --> 02:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to get rid of that statute
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
so yes if I may there's only one ly in
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
the state that we know of right now that
 
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
falls into this category and they're in
 
02:22:11.790 --> 02:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
the process of applying for their Nano
 
02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
Brewing license they they don't have it
 
02:22:16.830 --> 02:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
yet they're in the process and after you
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
know let's just say that you know a
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
generation goes by 20 years or so and
 
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
they decide they're no longer in the
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
business once they're they're out
 
02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
they're out they're out I mean you can't
 
02:22:29.950 --> 02:22:29.960 align:start position:0%
get it back then that loophole that was
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
created back when the Nano was passed is
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
closed and quite frankly it should have
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
been closed years ago but it didn't get
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
closed so now we don't want to authorize
 
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
a loophole with a statute that changes
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
the regulatory system that's been we
 
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to do the Nano we don't want
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
to do the Nano that's the whole point we
 
02:22:49.750 --> 02:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
want it to be a brew pup no but he's
 
02:22:51.670 --> 02:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
applying it because that's what he was
 
02:22:55.230 --> 02:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
told the only way he could do this is
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
that a nano is not prohibited a
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited interest because it was not
 
02:23:02.429 --> 02:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
put into the statute I think what they I
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
think the solution is what you just said
 
02:23:06.110 --> 02:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
that you didn't want I think that's a
 
02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:07.830 align:start position:0%
that you didn't want I think that's a
perfect

02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
okay so okay representative wals do you
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
have a question yes thank you I'm still
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
trying to catch up on all of this stuff
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
is the difference the main difference
 
02:23:23.389 --> 02:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
between this bill and 1076 the number of
 
02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
barrels is that because they seem
 
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as far as on Prem
 
02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
in ter right so it is it is similar in
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
the sense that um a another one of our
 
02:23:38.349 --> 02:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
quote unquote trampling on the three
 
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
tier that we allowed uh beverage
 
02:23:43.870 --> 02:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and in this case wine
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturers right to own a restaurant
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
restaurant oh okay that's the on you
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
know the on premise license is
 
02:23:55.630 --> 02:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant right okay now meanwhile you
 
02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
know they say if you want to go back to
 
02:23:59.230 --> 02:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
where so this is a restaurant that wants
 
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
a license he wants he wants to you know
 
02:24:05.469 --> 02:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
and and he wants to also he has a bunch
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
of restaurants and he wants to be able
 
02:24:10.830 --> 02:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
to brew his own beer and distribute to
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
all those locations much similar to
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
let's say what the Common Man does but
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
the difference being is he wants to brew
 
02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:19.469 align:start position:0%
the difference being is he wants to brew
it

02:24:19.469 --> 02:24:19.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
himself whereas the Common Man contracts
 
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
it out by a third- party company third
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
party manufacturer not being a a beer
 
02:24:32.349 --> 02:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
Enthusiast but with wine I happen to
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
frequent leels and dairy often and I
 
02:24:37.309 --> 02:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
know when I go to lael's I'm only going
 
02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
to get leel wine so if I go to a brew
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
pub that brews their
 
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
own beer or ale that's kind of you know
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
like if you go to Guinness in Ireland
 
02:24:52.030 --> 02:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to get
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
Guinness so that's because they really
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have a problem with tight
 
02:24:59.190 --> 02:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
houses right well you I guess I don't I
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
don't see the problem I guess visual the
 
02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
problem is is that in this case these
 
02:25:06.910 --> 02:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
are all these different restaurants so
 
02:25:10.590 --> 02:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
the fear is that if that rest all those
 
02:25:12.910 --> 02:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants are dependent upon one
 
02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:14.750 align:start position:0%
restaurants are dependent upon one
manufacturing

02:25:14.750 --> 02:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
02:25:18.190 --> 02:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
facility okay the fear was of Tide
 
02:25:20.469 --> 02:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
houses that that aneis are Bush because
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
they can produce more beer than
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
than that God needs and and therefore
 
02:25:31.550 --> 02:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
would then come into a bar and and and
 
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
basically and they always the fear was
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
strong arming them but that you know
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
saying that you're this is the only one
 
02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
you were going to sell and then that
 
02:25:41.150 --> 02:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
would force little guys out of the
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
business may I ask another but that's
 
02:25:46.230 --> 02:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
not the same here because in your
 
02:25:48.590 --> 02:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
example and Heiser Bush would own the
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
own that Brew pup we're talking about
 
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
the owner right now we don't allow Riser
 
02:25:54.349 --> 02:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
Bush to own restaurants that's right
 
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's so it's not quite Apples to
 
02:25:59.550 --> 02:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
Apples right right or beer to beer
 
02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why this that other
 
02:26:02.269 --> 02:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
bill that's why that bill is not the
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
same as this bill so yeah Scott you want
 
02:26:07.230 --> 02:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
to respond to that yeah thanks for the
 
02:26:09.309 --> 02:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
question representative Walsh I think
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
the difference here and this getss
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
really confusing is
 
02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
that with respect to the wine
 
02:26:18.030 --> 02:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer retail outlet or the
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer retail outlet
 
02:26:22.790 --> 02:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
those are a restaurant they are offsite
 
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
from the original location but they are
 
02:26:27.389 --> 02:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
a privilege of the manufacturer's
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
license they are not a retail license so
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
they exist still within this
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing tier they're not Crossing
 
02:26:38.429 --> 02:26:38.439 align:start position:0%
into another tier and the fear here is
 
02:26:40.110 --> 02:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
is just setting a precedent we have
 
02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
never allowed cross tier ownership we
 
02:26:44.510 --> 02:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
just like we don't allow people to pay
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
for space in the grocery store which is
 
02:26:49.190 --> 02:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
why when you go to Hanford you will see
 
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
probably 100 different labels of beer
 
02:26:53.550 --> 02:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
there and when you go into the potato
 
02:26:55.469 --> 02:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
chip aisle you're going to see you know
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
40 ft of Fredo products and maybe a few
 
02:27:00.510 --> 02:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
locals and that's about it and it's the
 
02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
same thing people pay for that space
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to do it it's the
 
02:27:06.429 --> 02:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
same Principle as having somebody own
 
02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
the retail store and the production
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
facility that makes the product that
 
02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:12.590 align:start position:0%
facility that makes the product that
they're

02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.309 --> 02:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
selling I'm pretty sure that if it's a
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
bakery everything they bake inside there
 
02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:20.470 align:start position:0%
is their their stuff just the
 
02:27:20.470 --> 02:27:22.429 align:start position:0%
is their their stuff just the
[Laughter]

02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol okay so obviously we're not
 
02:27:26.910 --> 02:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
going to solve this today um we do have
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
a deadline uh come next month and so we
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
hope we can figure out some solution
 
02:27:34.269 --> 02:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
here but I did want to make sure all the
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee members are are informed of
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
the discussion but I do want to allow
 
02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
mik sure I was just going to say that if
 
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
there are questions that we can't answer
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure that the folks behind us
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
from The Liquor Commission can because
 
02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
they're the experts on regulatory
 
02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:52.190 align:start position:0%
they're the experts on regulatory
matters

02:27:52.190 --> 02:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
matters
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you all
 
02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity thank you nice to
 
02:28:00.070 --> 02:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
see you Joe okay you get the last word
 
02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:05.190 align:start position:0%

02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
Mike thank you Mr chairman committee I
 
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to rebot a
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
little here um so a few comments
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
um where to begin so obviously uh there
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
was some discussion about this is about
 
02:28:21.429 --> 02:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
one license e it's really not about one
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
license e as as uh the previous speakers
 
02:28:25.389 --> 02:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned this it really is about an
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
indust industry change because and I
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
want to give paint a little bit of a
 
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
picture for you but you know I I find it
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
interesting that over the years since
 
02:28:34.750 --> 02:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
the Nano browers came around and the
 
02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers have been busily
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
trampling the three- tier system and
 
02:28:40.750 --> 02:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
shipping away at restaurants
 
02:28:42.429 --> 02:28:42.439 align:start position:0%
competitiveness in the in the market
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
space nobody objected to any of that
 
02:28:46.030 --> 02:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
except for me I was the only guy that
 
02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:47.230 align:start position:0%
except for me I was the only guy that
objected

02:28:47.230 --> 02:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
objected
 
02:28:49.590 --> 02:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
um but when we talk about a manufacturer
 
02:28:51.790 --> 02:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
has a retail location that's a violation
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
of three- tier system if they have a
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant that is technically a
 
02:28:56.469 --> 02:28:56.479 align:start position:0%
violation three- tier system because
 
02:28:58.150 --> 02:28:58.160 align:start position:0%
they're operating as a manufacturer and
 
02:29:00.349 --> 02:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
they're in the retail sector uh but
 
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's okay for the breweries and the
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
wineries but it's not okay for
 
02:29:04.990 --> 02:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants to go the other way and this
 
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
has been going on for the better part of
 
02:29:09.150 --> 02:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
15 years maybe longer but at least 15
 
02:29:11.469 --> 02:29:11.479 align:start position:0%
years and so really all we're asking for
 
02:29:13.269 --> 02:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
is the ability for a restaurant owner to
 
02:29:15.630 --> 02:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
have a brew pub to essentially compete
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
in the same space
 
02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
so for us and for our members and for my
 
02:29:22.349 --> 02:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
board who really adopted our policy uh
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
supporting this um this is about being
 
02:29:28.830 --> 02:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
able to compete uh competitively in the
 
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
same space and and you have to
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
understand the advantage of being a
 
02:29:34.349 --> 02:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
manufacturer the manufacturer they are
 
02:29:35.950 --> 02:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
getting their product to resell at
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
retail they're getting it at Cost versus
 
02:29:40.030 --> 02:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
wholesale which is what common man is
 
02:29:41.230 --> 02:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
getting through a contract Brewing
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
relationship versus buying it you know
 
02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
or through a distributor so this just
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
gives a restaurants the competitive
 
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
ability to the ability to compete
 
02:29:52.990 --> 02:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
competitively with all of the Brew PB
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
breweries that are out there now that
 
02:29:56.269 --> 02:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
are selling in many cases without any
 
02:29:57.990 --> 02:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
kind of food restrictions or
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
requirements and so that really has
 
02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
become kind of the Crux of the issue for
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of our
 
02:30:05.389 --> 02:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
guys I will also say that whilst I
 
02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:07.160 align:start position:0%
certainly have one member who testified
 
02:30:09.429 --> 02:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
at the original hearing on this bill I
 
02:30:11.630 --> 02:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
have received numerous uh businesses
 
02:30:13.150 --> 02:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
that have attempted to do this and I
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
think the commission could testified to
 
02:30:16.830 --> 02:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
this as well businesses who had wanted
 
02:30:19.469 --> 02:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
to do this in in the last few years so
 
02:30:21.389 --> 02:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
this is not just about one LC e this is
 
02:30:23.550 --> 02:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
about an industry that has been been
 
02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
chipped away at by the Brey industry and
 
02:30:26.910 --> 02:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to get into a
 
02:30:31.110 --> 02:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
competitive set with these guys
 
02:30:33.469 --> 02:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I will say is you
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
know it's not like every restaurant is
 
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
going to rush out and open a brew pub
 
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
the sheer cost of opening a brew pub is
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
is prohibitive uh Ian Buckley when he
 
02:30:43.469 --> 02:30:43.479 align:start position:0%
testified mentioned that he was into the
 
02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
in for the tune of $12 million this is
 
02:30:47.790 --> 02:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
not Trump change right this is a
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
significant commitment and so I don't
 
02:30:51.550 --> 02:30:51.560 align:start position:0%
suspect there's going to be a whole ton
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
of restaurants that are going to do this
 
02:30:55.269 --> 02:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
assuming that you allow them right to do
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
so this is going to be very limited
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
group of people and they are already
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
restricted by their distribution amounts
 
02:31:03.309 --> 02:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
of 2500 barrels and I will also say that
 
02:31:04.590 --> 02:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
you know in conversations with a number
 
02:31:06.870 --> 02:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
of restaurants that have uh Brew Pub
 
02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
licenses now you know they they they
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
consume at their original location
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
almost a th000 barrels a year in beer
 
02:31:16.469 --> 02:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
just for that location so really when
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
you talk about seven restaurants he's
 
02:31:18.950 --> 02:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be able to make
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
enough beer to distribute to all of his
 
02:31:22.190 --> 02:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
restaurants anyway it's going to be kind
 
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
of like a house offering but he's going
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
to have a whole bunch of other
 
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
selections available that he's going to
 
02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
have to buy from other Distributors Etc
 
02:31:31.870 --> 02:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
so this is this is not going to be a
 
02:31:33.550 --> 02:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
fundamental shift in the industry it's
 
02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
going to be a teeny tiny piece of what's
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to happen uh in the industry as a
 
02:31:42.269 --> 02:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
whole um I think that's it I won't beat
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
the dead horse I apologize but thank you
 
02:31:45.670 --> 02:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to get apologize for
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:52.030 --> 02:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
buo yeah you were talking about um other
 
02:31:54.309 --> 02:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
um restaurants that you know were
 
02:31:56.030 --> 02:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
thinking of doing what Buckley is you
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
know was doing but have any of them
 
02:32:01.550 --> 02:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
spent millions of dollars to get ready
 
02:32:04.030 --> 02:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
to do what he thought he could do no
 
02:32:06.349 --> 02:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
because in in the in the SC scenario
 
02:32:08.269 --> 02:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
we're talking about those people had
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
looked to buy a an existing Brew pup
 
02:32:12.349 --> 02:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
they went to the commission commission
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
told them you can't buy it because it
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
crosses the tier so that killed
 
02:32:17.790 --> 02:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
essential an entrepreneurial effort to
 
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
re to rescue a business that I I think a
 
02:32:21.550 --> 02:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
couple of them went out of business
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
right so that's jobs lost meals and
 
02:32:26.830 --> 02:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
rentals tax revenues lost etc etc in
 
02:32:28.510 --> 02:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
this particular instance this is a brand
 
02:32:30.510 --> 02:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
new build so he went to the Liquor
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
Commission and he was told well you
 
02:32:34.190 --> 02:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
can't get licensed as a brewbot but we
 
02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
have this really creative workaround
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
which as a state I don't like the idea
 
02:32:39.550 --> 02:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
of workarounds right I think we should
 
02:32:41.389 --> 02:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
allow it the right or not allow the
 
02:32:43.389 --> 02:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
right and so but with the with the
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
nanoor license he could get a workaround
 
02:32:47.389 --> 02:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
so he would get license in Arab Brewery
 
02:32:49.230 --> 02:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
he would also have under the same roof a
 
02:32:51.269 --> 02:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant license the only restriction
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
would be he would have to have a wall
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
dividing the two licenses and he'd have
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
to drive the beer out through the
 
02:32:57.150 --> 02:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
parking lot and deliver it to the
 
02:32:59.309 --> 02:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
restaurant which just seems like a weird
 
02:33:01.389 --> 02:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
scenario to me and I think for most
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
people one other thing I will say is
 
02:33:05.389 --> 02:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
when you look at a brew pop license I
 
02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of talk about it
 
02:33:08.429 --> 02:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
being a manufacturer's license but it is
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
no more a manufacturer's license than it
 
02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
is a restaurant license because it is a
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
full-blown restaurant it has uh beer
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
wine spirits it has food requirements it
 
02:33:17.389 --> 02:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
meets every other standard that they
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
have to meet in order to be a full
 
02:33:20.630 --> 02:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant so it is no more a
 
02:33:22.110 --> 02:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturer than a restaurant than it
 
02:33:24.670 --> 02:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
is a restaurant versus a manufacturer so
 
02:33:26.349 --> 02:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
it's this weird hybrid that the state of
 
02:33:28.990 --> 02:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has created and so we just
 
02:33:30.670 --> 02:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
see this as kind of an incremental way
 
02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:37.070 --> 02:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
competitive representative
 
02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
spear from your experience a lot of our
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
our three tier uh implementation if you
 
02:33:47.469 --> 02:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
will came about as a result of getting
 
02:33:49.150 --> 02:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
rid of
 
02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition isn't it essentially right
 
02:33:58.110 --> 02:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it really does seem like it's time
 
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:03.640 align:start position:0%
to modernize a little
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
bit and start being a little bit more
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
flexible I don't know just a
 
02:34:14.269 --> 02:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
thought um so just so you know the
 
02:34:17.790 --> 02:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission which is our still is
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
still considered a three-tier
 
02:34:23.230 --> 02:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
model and wait till you hear how that
 
02:34:27.429 --> 02:34:27.439 align:start position:0%

02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
wait which one of we start because there
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
a bunch of them on here what did we
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
cover when I was gone because I had to
 
02:35:58.429 --> 02:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
go speak to a bill say it again what did
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
I miss because I had to speak to a bill
 
02:36:02.429 --> 02:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
uh we were just you wanted to speak on
 
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
you doesn't did we didn't take up your
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%

showed you uh 15 we talked about 1591
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:21.150 --> 02:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
1380 and 1380 was the one we were just
 
02:36:22.950 --> 02:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
discussing Al so we didn't really get
 
02:36:25.110 --> 02:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
too much through so I I think we really
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't have much time unless you really
 
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%

though I'm sure you just thought have
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
conversation yeah that's
 
02:37:37.309 --> 02:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay okay as we were talking about
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
contract Brewers now we're going to talk
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
about tenant
 
02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:54.750 align:start position:0%
about tenant
Brewing

02:37:54.750 --> 02:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
draft and you're you're good with this
 
02:38:04.670 --> 02:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
you're good with this 1 amend coming
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
around okay so why don't you just tell
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:14.469 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I just realized technically
 
02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
we can't vote on it because we don't
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
have I don't have the
 
02:38:23.630 --> 02:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
ls version of it but theoretically we
 
02:38:25.150 --> 02:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
don't need it for the subcommittee we
 
02:38:27.190 --> 02:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
can approve this and then and then take
 
02:38:30.030 --> 02:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
it up to the full committee
 
02:38:33.389 --> 02:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
so thank you chairman committee
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
members uh House Bill 1358 does several
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
things but as as the uh chairman briefly
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
explained one of the concepts on this
 
02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
was to address the contract
 
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that is that is allowed in
 
02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
the beverage manufacturing tiers so the
 
02:38:57.630 --> 02:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturing license the um
 
02:39:00.190 --> 02:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
Brew Pub license and the Nano Brewery
 
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
license the first concept of this was to
 
02:39:06.269 --> 02:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
expand that to the wine manufacturers
 
02:39:07.469 --> 02:39:07.479 align:start position:0%
and the liquor
 
02:39:09.389 --> 02:39:09.399 align:start position:0%
manufacturers contract brewing and
 
02:39:12.590 --> 02:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
tenant room because we've had several
 
02:39:17.550 --> 02:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
industry members uh in the past who
 
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to start up a business or they
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
have a recipe that they don't have the
 
02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:23.790 align:start position:0%
have a recipe that they don't have the
equipment

02:39:23.790 --> 02:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:39:26.910 --> 02:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
for right so under the tenant
 
02:39:29.790 --> 02:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturing concept they
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
would um with a tenant manufacturing
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
license go on to another existing wine
 
02:39:38.950 --> 02:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or liquor manufacturer and
 
02:39:41.590 --> 02:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
they would use their equipment to
 
02:39:43.750 --> 02:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
produce their
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
product okay under the
 
02:39:50.510 --> 02:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
contract manufacturing an existing
 
02:39:54.190 --> 02:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
licensed manufacturer would enter into a
 
02:39:56.389 --> 02:39:56.399 align:start position:0%
contract to
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
produce a product an alcoholic beverage
 
02:39:59.399 --> 02:40:00.710 align:start position:0%
produce a product an alcoholic beverage
with

02:40:00.710 --> 02:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
another lensey another existing
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer right is the difference
 
02:40:09.309 --> 02:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
between contract and tenant right so
 
02:40:13.750 --> 02:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
this already exists for beer beverages
 
02:40:16.389 --> 02:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
but it didn't exist for wine or liquor
 
02:40:18.389 --> 02:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
this is expanding it out to include wine
 
02:40:19.550 --> 02:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
and liquor in
 
02:40:25.429 --> 02:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
it what it's also doing um and and a a
 
02:40:29.550 --> 02:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
representative from uh Noble is here a
 
02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
business a beverage manufacturer here in
 
02:40:34.230 --> 02:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and of course he could
 
02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:36.110 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and of course he could
testify

02:40:36.110 --> 02:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:40:40.110 --> 02:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
um to our discussions on this but uh for
 
02:40:43.870 --> 02:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
a business model that wants
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
to bring a product product in from out
 
02:40:46.640 --> 02:40:47.510 align:start position:0%
to bring a product product in from out
of

02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:40:50.269 --> 02:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
state right that is that is allowed
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
under a tenant
 
02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:53.790 align:start position:0%
under a tenant
manufacturing

02:40:53.790 --> 02:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
02:40:57.230 --> 02:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
license to bring a product from another
 
02:41:00.830 --> 02:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
state into our state in order to package
 
02:41:05.750 --> 02:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
it the problem is that you're limited on
 
02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
what products you can you can do that
 
02:41:10.429 --> 02:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
for under the tenant Brewing license you
 
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
only can do it for beer and Specialty
 
02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
Beer as the statute is written this
 
02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
expands it out
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
to be available for products that you
 
02:41:23.349 --> 02:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
currently are licensed to produce which
 
02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
in this case for Noble's purposes would
 
02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:27.110 align:start position:0%
in this case for Noble's purposes would
include

02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
include
 
02:41:31.590 --> 02:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
cider okay so this is this bill expands
 
02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
the contract Brewing the tenant Brewing
 
02:41:38.750 --> 02:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
to tenant manufacturing and contract
 
02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and
 
02:41:45.510 --> 02:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
allows the um products to come into to
 
02:41:49.469 --> 02:41:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:49.479 --> 02:41:51.230 align:start position:0%
 
state

02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:41:54.670 --> 02:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:03.110 --> 02:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
yeses this is the first time that we're
 
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
seeing the draft
 
02:42:08.349 --> 02:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
correct but no we've had this bill we
 
02:42:10.630 --> 02:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
had the bill we have the bill we had the
 
02:42:13.230 --> 02:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
bill and the Brewers Association came in
 
02:42:20.550 --> 02:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:26.750 --> 02:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
did and they're not here does nobody
 
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
here they provided the Brewers
 
02:42:33.150 --> 02:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
Association did provide testimony a
 
02:42:35.870 --> 02:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
02:42:40.269 --> 02:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
okay no was it looks like this
 
02:42:44.110 --> 02:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
it's okay yeah it looks B well do you
 
02:42:45.870 --> 02:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
see that language in this build well
 
02:42:47.389 --> 02:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
that's what I I this is the first I'm
 
02:42:48.990 --> 02:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
looking at it so I'm wondering if
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
anything if we took any of their
 
02:42:54.710 --> 02:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
advice some of that is addressed in here
 
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
one of the recommended changes from the
 
02:43:00.510 --> 02:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh Brewers Association was using
 
02:43:02.790 --> 02:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
instead of the term tenant manufacturing
 
02:43:05.150 --> 02:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
using the terminology consistent with
 
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
the federal um regulations is
 
02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:09.150 align:start position:0%
the federal um regulations is
alternating

02:43:09.150 --> 02:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
alternating
 
02:43:11.950 --> 02:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
proprietorship which is an ALT industry
 
02:43:15.309 --> 02:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
term referred to as alt prop under an
 
02:43:17.150 --> 02:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
alternating proprietorship is the same
 
02:43:18.990 --> 02:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
thing as the tenant
 
02:43:21.830 --> 02:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
Brewer but
 
02:43:25.150 --> 02:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
um we didn't adopt those changes in the
 
02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
amendment but there were also
 
02:43:31.870 --> 02:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions you didn't take we did take
 
02:43:33.830 --> 02:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
some of the suggestions yes okay well I
 
02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm really concerned about is
 
02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
you did give it a thorough good look
 
02:43:38.429 --> 02:43:38.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely we've been working with all
 
02:43:40.950 --> 02:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
industry um members on this Bill thank
 
02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:44.269 align:start position:0%
industry um members on this Bill thank
you

02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.279 --> 02:43:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:52.349 --> 02:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
that term you used is alternating
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
proprietorship yes it's a Federal
 
02:43:57.230 --> 02:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
Federal ttb Regulation they refer to it
 
02:43:59.349 --> 02:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
as an alternating
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
welcome all right so given that we're so
 
02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
but this so I'm this is your version
 
02:44:18.990 --> 02:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
right what I'm what we're looking at
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
right it looks like our version so you
 
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
just would you make sure that the
 
02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:25.590 align:start position:0%
just would you make sure that the
beverage

02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.469 --> 02:44:29.479 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have okay to just to okay
 
02:44:33.309 --> 02:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
certainly make sure they they're okay it
 
02:44:33.319 --> 02:44:35.070 align:start position:0%
certainly make sure they they're okay it
um

02:44:35.070 --> 02:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:38.030 --> 02:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
but just goes to show this is you know
 
02:44:40.190 --> 02:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
liquor laws or mother mayi everything is
 
02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:41.990 align:start position:0%
liquor laws or mother mayi everything is
illegal

02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
until somebody comes in and this is you
 
02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
know when I was talking about how this
 
02:44:49.070 --> 02:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
isn't the only guy you know nobl is the
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
only person who ever came in from out of
 
02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
state and say gee I want to I want to do
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
this inside your state and so yeah and
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to we're trying to solve a
 
02:45:02.389 --> 02:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
couple of problems with this not just
 
02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
the original request but it also um is
 
02:45:08.349 --> 02:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
trying to to get clarify this the
 
02:45:10.349 --> 02:45:10.359 align:start position:0%
difference between the tenant
 
02:45:13.309 --> 02:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and also includes the wine
 
02:45:16.030 --> 02:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
so and also and flavored malt beverage
 
02:45:18.030 --> 02:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
right do we have the
 
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
other the espe especially beverage which
 
02:45:23.309 --> 02:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
is the higher higher alcohol content so
 
02:45:25.990 --> 02:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's we're trying to make sure we
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
cover everybody
 
02:45:30.230 --> 02:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
represent thank you um I just got
 
02:45:31.870 --> 02:45:31.880 align:start position:0%
confused because I'm looking at the
 
02:45:36.590 --> 02:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
draft and it refers repeatedly to tenant
 
02:45:40.190 --> 02:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturer uh and doesn't again I'm
 
02:45:42.670 --> 02:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
just skimming over it uh since I hadn't
 
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
seen it before either uh but it doesn't
 
02:45:48.110 --> 02:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
seem to refer to alternating
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
proprietorship so I'm confused whether
 
02:45:52.429 --> 02:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
this is the same draft you're talking
 
02:45:55.670 --> 02:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
about thank you representative in in in
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes the alternating proprietorship was a
 
02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation that was made by the
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
Brewers Association right she's saying
 
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
she doesn't see that phrase in the bill
 
02:46:08.030 --> 02:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
because we didn't put it in the
 
02:46:11.830 --> 02:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
amendment we elected to continue to use
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
the tenant language which is
 
02:46:18.870 --> 02:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
part of the title 13 our title so we
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
revie reviewed that recommendation but
 
02:46:23.110 --> 02:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
decided not to accept it correct thank
 
02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
02:46:28.990 --> 02:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
you okay so we still need have an
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
amendment drawn up yep
 
02:46:35.309 --> 02:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right that's enough for
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:42.870 --> 02:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
you L have
 
02:46:51.309 --> 02:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
yes so that way that way
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
room
