we're waiting for members to trickle in
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
from their various places and the
 
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that they have to
 
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 align:start position:0%

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
session followed by the end of session
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee lunch which some of us
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
consider to be the even more important
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
activity of the
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
day but we we'll begin as we usually do
 
00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
by all rising and joining representative
 
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
Allegiance indivisible with liberty and
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
all so this is our final bill for the
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
2024 session of the house a Senate bill
 
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 595
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
FN which is a bill that seeks to deal
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
with an
 
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
issue regarding poll attachment
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
rate cases and disagreements and
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
disputes and as many of you know the
 
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
original Bill actually
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to have the department of energy
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
create a formula that the commission
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
would then use and we're going to be
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
proposing an amendment this morning that
 
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
asks the doe to conduct an investigation
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
first so that all parties can
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
participate in coming up with a formula
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
that everyone can agree
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
with so that is
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
the uh strategy that we will use
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to wait a few more minutes
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
because there are some members who are
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
testifying in front of the senate or
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise occupied will open the exec
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
10:15 now does anybody have any they
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
would like to bring before the committee
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
wait so we have lunch reservations at
 
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.509 align:start position:0%
wait so we have lunch reservations at
11:30

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
11:30
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
rep representative uh Vice chair Thomas
 
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:35.320 align:start position:0%

Restaurant at 11:30 this morning right
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
now my headcount I believe is
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
18 um so we will take up the entire
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant that's about their
 
00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
capacity and it's a not too bad of a
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
walk it's a short walk over there so I
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to uh hustle over
 
00:09:58.750 --> 00:09:58.760 align:start position:0%

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
so be there by by 11:30 and uh they're
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
going to have a I guess they're going to
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
have a long table for us so grab your
 
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
menu um okay and please be patient until
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
10:15 and we'll begin our executive
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
session representative McGee yeah I took
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
a look at the Senate bills that we have
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
um uh house bills passed by the Senate
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
actually that are pending and I'm
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that some of these might be
 
00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
coming over to us for Con well they will
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
be coming to us for concurrence and I
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
was just wondering if we have had any
 
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
discussion or if you have had any
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
thoughts about the four bills um it's I
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
I mean I I pretty much know the status
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
but I think there may be some
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
conversation about what changes were
 
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:44.200 align:start position:0%
done in the Senate if we want to talk
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
about that um we have HB 458 which is um
 
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
this nuclear power study bill uh I and I
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't think they made any changes to
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
that and then there HB 609 which is the
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
fast track of the SEC which we changed
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe they changed as
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
well um but they made some I think minor
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
edits and then hb1 1431 integrated
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
distribution planning um that's in their
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
52 Senate journal and um I admit I have
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
to go take a look at at that at that
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment at their amended version um
 
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
I've heard about the changes but I
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
haven't read it
 
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
yet and then HB 1697 on the forest
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
uh so I didn't know if you had any
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts about those or yes I can
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
comment on all of those I have um
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
already instructed the clerk our
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
position on those bills on HB
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
458 we will nonc concur with the Senate
 
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
change and request a committee of
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
conference and the reason for that is
 
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate changed the wording of the
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
house version of the bill
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
to indicate that they wanted to see a
 
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.870 align:start position:0%
to indicate that they wanted to see a
single

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
single
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
point of assessment activity for
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
Generation assets but the bill as passed
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
by the house allowed
 
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.629 align:start position:0%
by the house allowed
for

00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
multiple points of view to be
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
accommodated in the assessment formulas
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
that eventually get created so we
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a more proper
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
course to take for this bill so we're
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
going to try to ask the Senate to either
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
aced to the house position or maybe
 
00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:41.079 align:start position:0%
suggest some modified language that
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
accommodates both of those
 
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
things House Bill 609 as you all will
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
recall is an extensive bill that reforms
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee the Senate
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
made four changes to that bill all of
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
which improve the bill and so I
 
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
concurred with the Senate's changes to
 
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
that bill the four changes and I'm doing
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
this from memory so I may get some of it
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
wrong but uh the four changes include
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
adding some language to the Preamble
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
about the importance of fishing game and
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
other natural resources some language
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
about adding
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
offshore to
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
the language in the Preamble Preamble
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
some language about that was suggested I
 
00:13:33.079 --> 00:13:34.910 align:start position:0%
some language about that was suggested I
think

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
by well it doesn't matter who suggested
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
the language but anyway some language to
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
clarify how cities and towns get
 
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.350 align:start position:0%
clarify how cities and towns get
notified

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
notified
 
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.350 align:start position:0%
notified
about

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
pending sighting
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
changes and the last
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
change had to do with notification also
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
so they were all good changes relatively
 
00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
minor they don't change the substance of
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
the bill they just
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
clarify uh a few of the the
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
details House Bill
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
1431 was a bill that we passed to
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
reinstitute a long range planning
 
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
process for Distribution Systems and the
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
change that this that the Senate made
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
was they took
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
out some changes that were made to RSA
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
378 colon
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
37 which is the state energy policy
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
section of state law they took those out
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
uh restored it to its current state
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
basically or left it alone and then they
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
made one other small change to the
 
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.749 align:start position:0%
made one other small change to the
effective

00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
date of the bill I believe so it takes
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
effect upon
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
passage once again I'm working for
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
memory so I'm not 100% sure that was the
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
only change but I think that's what it
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
was was and then for
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
1697 they made no sub substantive change
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
but they did change some language at the
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
very end of the bill to
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
clarify um just exactly
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
how communities would be not notified of
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
of creating a carbon credits
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
registry once it's developed it it was
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
good a good language change so I
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
concurred with that as well so I'll
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
explain all of these changes in more
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
um yes I'm sorry we concurred with 1431
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
as well so of the four bills that
 
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative McGee mentioned we
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
concurred with three and requested a
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
committee of conference for one
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh did you you have something you want
 
00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
anybody that's all that we've received
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
from the Senate so far I'm aware that
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
the Senate has passed some of our bills
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
out of committee but I don't think
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
they've gone to the senate floor yet so
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
we don't have them they haven't been
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
they haven't been adopted sufficiently
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
to come to the house yet all right so I
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up question sure since
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
this is our last actual meeting in
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
person in public how do we discuss those
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
further concurrences because I know we
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
have to kind of or I have to relay to my
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
caucus if we're not meeting physically
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh once we have a notice on a bill so
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
that if we have some you know if we
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
disagree or whatever we we have an
 
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that well we can
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
discuss that as a committee my stry
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
would be to contact you and have a
 
00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:03.799 align:start position:0%
discussion with
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
you um just the two of us and if we can
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
come to some kind of a consensus then
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
we'll move forward with that if we can't
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
we could call another meeting of the
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
full committee to discuss a path forward
 
00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:20.470 align:start position:0%
full committee to discuss a path forward
okay

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
okay all right well it's it's beyond to
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
10:15 so I'm going to open an exec
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 595
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
FN relative to the rates for poll
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
attachments and I'm going to move aop
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
pass on the bill and recognize
 
00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:45.070 align:start position:0%
pass on the bill and recognize
representative

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
amendment uh yes I I want to um move the
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
amendment 1931 H I recognize Vice chair
 
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
Thomas second moved and seconded that we
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
adopt the amendment 2024 d19
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
31h which everyone has received a copy
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
of just a few moments ago I apologize
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
for the fact that the amendment came in
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.950 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
was con conf refusing to OS and so the
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
amendment they supplied didn't achieve
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
the outcome we were looking
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
for so as a result of that we requested
 
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment that you see before you at
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
9:00 this
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
morning this is the original amendment
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
intended for OS to draft and now that
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
the confusion has been cleared up we now
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
have the amendment that we wanted to
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
bring to the
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
committee so what does this amendment do
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment as you can read on lines
 
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
five and six request that the department
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
of energy set up an investigatory
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
proceeding about the use of a poll
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
attachment rate
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
formula that will be used once it's
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
developed by the Public Public Utilities
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
Commission to resolve
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
disputes when there are pole attachment
 
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.870 align:start position:0%
disputes when there are pole attachment
disp

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
disp
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
disputes the rest of the bill is
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
language that sets up
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
the conditions under which the
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
investigation will take place and who
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
will pay for it
 
00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
Etc and it's fairly straightforward
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
language not completely different from
 
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
what was in the original
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
bill so it does require that the
 
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
department investigate the use of a pole
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
attachment formula
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
and potentially to develop such a
 
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0%
formula and it also requires the
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
commission the Public Utilities
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
Commission to maintain and Report
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
property information to ensure that
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
information questions or comments from
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
the committee about this amendment
 
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.470 align:start position:0%
the committee about this amendment
representative

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um I'm looking
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
at lines 18 and 19 where um at the
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the investigation the
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
department shall issue a report of its
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
findings to the house Science Tech and
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
energy committee um with should there be
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
added well I'm not going to I'm not
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
going to hold up an amendment but um is
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this report to propose
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
legislative Solutions or they just going
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
want the purpose I believe is to keep us
 
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
informed Med as to
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
the formula that
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
they eventually settle upon as being a
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
relevant and acceptable formula for all
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
parties to to move forward
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
down now that that's a different
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
language I was looking at language at
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
2930 on page 1 and 1 and two on page two
 
00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:36.039 align:start position:0%
but that applies to something
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
else essentially it basically
 
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.070 align:start position:0%
else essentially it basically
requires

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
requires
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
that the department issue this report
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
and it's likely that the report will
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
contain the formula that everybody
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
agrees to but do we then have to
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
authorize that that formula or or okay
 
00:21:59.710 --> 00:21:59.720 align:start position:0%
it or they can just go ahead and do use
 
00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
line five and six that the rate formula
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
will be used by the commission when
 
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.350 align:start position:0%
will be used by the commission when
resolving

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
resolving
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
disputes so once the report containing
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
the formula is available then that will
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
be available to the commission to use to
 
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.830 align:start position:0%
be available to the commission to use to
resolve

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
disputes yes as representative bernardy
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
just pointed out rules 16 and 17
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
indicate that the commission has to do
 
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
some rule making to it um incorporate
 
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.190 align:start position:0%
some rule making to it um incorporate
that

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
formula representative
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you um I'm going to couch
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
my question in terms of computer
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
programming um there are two types of if
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
statements if then and if then else I
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
see an if then I don't see an if then
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
else here so it says if the department
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
determines through this investigation
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
that the use of a formula would fully
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
compensate pole
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
owners what if the department does not
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
determine through its investigation that
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
the use of a formula what happens then
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
that's the else part that's
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
missing the implication I think is that
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
they have to keep going until they till
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
they satisfy the then there is no else
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
so then it's a repeat until Loop a
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
repeat until
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
exactly representative McGee thank you
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um so on line eight which
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
starts that sentence if the department
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
determines through this investigation
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
that the use of a formula would fully
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
compensate pole owners for their portion
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
of costs of owning maintaining and
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
operating polls arising from pole
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
attachments the stuff that's after that
 
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
semicolon is actually
 
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
um was added to the language in order to
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
satisfy my request in the hearings that
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
we identify some outcomes that this
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
investigation needs to solve for so that
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
it not determine uh among or against any
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
one attaching entity including the poll
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
owner be transparent to all parties
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
result in just and reasonable rates and
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
the development uh
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
shall oh the department shall develop
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
and finalize such formula meeting these
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
criteria no later than J January 1 2026
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
so we basically are sort of corralling
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
the process and saying by this time
 
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
frame you need to address these
 
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
specifics in your uh Ru making as to how
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
poll rates for dis discrepancies between
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
the parties will go forward um but I do
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
take your point that just the sentence
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
itself doesn't resolve in the way the
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
start of the sentence would would
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
warrant you know it seems like it might
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
smithing and I would remind them members
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
that Jael car will eventually have to
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
approve any rule that is developed by
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
the commission based on all this
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah thank you
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um little confused here I'm
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
trying to put my uh old pu hat back on
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
for a minute here and it sounds like
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
we're saying the department of energy is
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
going to come up with a formula and then
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
the Pu is forced to use that formula
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
into rule making well the Pu is a
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
separate entity that has the authority
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
to make their own rules within the scope
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
of the law so are we telling them that
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
they must do what the department of
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
energy tells them to do and what's the
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
point of rulemaking uh if that's the
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
deal are you asking a question or yeah I
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
am I I think we have an issue here and
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have some legal
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
interpretation of it can the department
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
of energy do they have the authority to
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
tell the Pu here's what you're going to
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
do in rule making because the rulemaking
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
just becomes a you know just a never no
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
never mind because we're telling you
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
what to do and I don't I'm not sure that
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
the department of energy has the
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
authority to do that and like I say I
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer and I don't even
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
pretend to be one but maybe someone with
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit more legal background or
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
maybe from the Department of energy or
 
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
maybe from the Pu could uh advise us is
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
as to how that's going to
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
work would the department like to
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Chris Elms
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um I I would say
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
first off under you know if the
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
legislature passes a bill right we would
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
have that Authority but in this case um
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know we view this as the department
 
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
is going to pursue the investigation
 
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
develop the formula um that would come
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
out of that and put it before the Pu the
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
Pu would have the opportunity to
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
undertake their own rulemaking here to
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
incorporate that that formula within
 
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.230 align:start position:0%
incorporate that that formula within
their

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
authorities follow up yeah um okay
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
here's my problem it says the commission
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
shall conduct a formal rule maky to
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
incorporate the formula developed by the
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
department so what it's saying is that
 
00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.070 align:start position:0%
department so what it's saying is that
the

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
must develop rules based on what the
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
department of energy is telling them to
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
do and I'm not sure that the department
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
of energy has that Authority or we go
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
one step further do we want them to have
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
that Authority because the Pu is an
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
independent body and they should be able
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
to make their own decisions telling them
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
to make rules when you get when you got
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
to give them the rules doesn't seem like
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
rule making and someone's going to bring
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
that up in the hearings in the rul
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
making saying well I don't like what the
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy did so so can they
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
change that if they given new
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
information or are they fixed in
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
according to this you must do what the
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
department of energy tells you and don't
 
00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
make any independent decisions sure I
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
before you answer doesn't the language
 
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.750 align:start position:0%
before you answer doesn't the language
on

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
line 15 that says within 30 days
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
following the close of the Department's
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
proceeding the commission shall conduct
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
a formal rulemaking isn't that a
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
legislative prescription that allows
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
this to
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
happen so yes yes uh thank you I I do
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
agree with you representative V that
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
that is the case um and I apologize our
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
general counsel is out today he was
 
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the bill but I'm not a
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer so I I if I get something wrong
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
or I'll ask Amanda to come running up
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
here to clarify something that I uh that
 
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
I said wrong um this is as much in part
 
00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
because the department has the
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
capability and the capacity to go
 
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
undertake the investigation and the
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
proceeding uh related to that this is we
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
we view this bill as the legislature
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
saying we want you this process to
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
happen through the state executive
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
branch we will we will go through and do
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
that make that report with the results
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
of those investigation to this committee
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
um and then and then proceed with the ru
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
making that that you see here um the
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
result of any rule making whether it's
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
through the department or through the
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
commission does have to go through the
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
jail car process and I representative B
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
referenced this earlier that is another
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
opport opportunity for the legislature
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
to weigh in and approve uh the results
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
rulem thank you representative muns
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I you know
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
the what I understand is we're replacing
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
a formula that's going to be developed
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
by the department with
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
um replacing that replacing the well in
 
00:29:59.509 --> 00:29:59.519 align:start position:0%
in in St statute today there is there
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
already is a multi-part test the statute
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
says they must use a multi-art test so
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to replace that with a
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
formula so I'm not sure that
 
00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:14.519 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's concern is
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
is is valid I mean we already have that
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
right I mean we've already the
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
legislature has already said you have to
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
use this kind of approach we're just
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
changing that to a formula
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
approach okay
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
does anybody have anything else they
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
would like to ask of commissioner Els
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
Elms if not I'll let you go thank you
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate your help further discussion
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
um I have two things that I'd like to
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
clarification on um from the original
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
Bill the date was on or before the
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
effective date of this section in this
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
in the amendment and you don't have to
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
pull it up but it's the first amendment
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
we got which was
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
um oh I don't even know where it is
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
anyway um the the amendment we had prior
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
to this one talked about a January 1st
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
date and then this one talks about a
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
July 1st date can you just walk me
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
through why there's three different
 
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
these probably because there were three
 
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.870 align:start position:0%
these probably because there were three
different

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
legislative um vehicles that were
 
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.750 align:start position:0%
legislative um vehicles that were
created

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
and as each vehicle gets created you
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
probably have to change the date to
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
accommodate the
 
00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919 align:start position:0%
process that would be my guess I don't
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
know of any specific reason why it would
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
be why it would have been done for any
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
other reason okay the bill itself does
 
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
say that the final formula I have it
 
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
shall be developed no later than January
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
1st of
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
2026 so by by making the bill effective
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
July 1st of 2024 that basically gives 18
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
months for this investigatory proceeding
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
to all right finish its work um can I
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
have a followup yes follow up um my my
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
second question was on and I have it now
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
the um the prior Amendment which was
 
00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
1668 I had a comment here that grants
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
cover construction and make ready is
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
that information included in this
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
amendment the new amendment is it a
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
concern that was covered or is it not a
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
concern read it again please grants
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
ready no that's that's just a note I
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
took on it oh a note you took yeah from
 
00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.950 align:start position:0%
took on it oh a note you took yeah from
the

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
discussion so is that something that's a
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
concern and that might impact this
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
formula making or is it not go
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah I would say
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
that uh we we've got just in reasonable
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
cost recovery which I think you know in
 
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
the hearings with the Pu or in any
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
formula that's being devised they are
 
00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:08.919 align:start position:0%
required to look at the actual costs
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
that people have to recover in order to
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
be made whole that's the kind of the
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
starting point in any of the formulas so
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's covered okay yeah all right
 
00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.509 align:start position:0%
I think it's covered okay yeah all right
representative

00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
bernardy yes I think the Make Ready part
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
is covered by uh compensate poll owners
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
for on P line nine compensate poll
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
owners for their portion of the cost of
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
owning maintaining and operating polls
 
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
so that's making ready for new lines and
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
whatever else has to be done okay all
 
00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:43.960 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative Ms um I'm
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um I'm going to raise um
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's two concerns and
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
concerns so um I guess that the so
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying this is a poker
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
game I'm I'm I'm I don't know if I want
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
to I don't know if I want to distinguish
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
it that way um so um I guess the first
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
the first question I had was on line
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
13 um we talk about the cost of the
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
proceeding may be assessed to parties
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
36537 Roman numeral 2 I guess the
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
question I have there is I just want to
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that that that does
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
not only include the owners of the polls
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
but the people that are bringing the
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
proceeding or the the the users of the
 
00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
polls um I think the language um I think
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
the language in RSA
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
365 372 includes includes users but I
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.879 --> 00:34:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
owners

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
owners
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we could look up RSA 365
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
col colon 70 or col
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
says I don't know if there's anybody
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
here that can talk to
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
that well it looks like it's a fairly
 
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:19.910 align:start position:0%
that well it looks like it's a fairly
lengthy

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
paragraph I mean I'm looking at it as
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
well and it says the um I see language
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
it says the Commission in the department
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
of energy May assess the cost of experts
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
accountants or other assistants hired by
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
the commission of the Department of
 
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
energy against the utilities and any
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
other parties to the
 
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
proceeding so it looks like that would
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
appear to to cover your concern
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
right I I I I think so I just want to
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that um you know
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
um you know what is the definition of a
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
party to the proceeding I mean if do you
 
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
do you have to formally ask to be part
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
of the process or is it anybody that's
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
that are all attachers going to be
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
included in the
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
assessment a representative I mean
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner Elms uh thank you back
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
again um and and again apologies if I
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
get something wrong I'm not the the
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
counselor or business office but in this
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
case yes so all parties to the
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding um you know could share in
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
the costs of the whatever costs are
 
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
associated with that proceeding uh being
 
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599 align:start position:0%
a party means you know that's how you
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
participate and so uh you know in in
 
00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
this case folks who are concerned and
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
who've raised this issue right are those
 
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
attaches who uh might not be a mandatory
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
party but they are the ones who would be
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
interested in expressing their their
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
their views here and having their voice
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
heard uh so we feel pretty confident
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
that those parties would be able to be
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
assessed follow up um so would would the
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
party would it an attacher for example
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
would they have to file some notice with
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
the Department or the puing saying yes
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
we are we are interested in this we are
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
an interested party or would would by
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
definition all attachers be included and
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
so I apologize for not being as up to
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
date on this but there is a process
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
which somebody becomes a a a formal
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
proceeding representative
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
Harrington oh go ahead I I had my other
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
two he's got other two my other two
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
concerns I'm willing to let me
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
so may I go ahead okay sorry what's up
 
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.470 align:start position:0%
so may I go ahead okay sorry what's up
um

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
um duly noted um one second concern was
 
00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
and and this may just be a a drafting
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
issue or may not be but in line 15
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to required in
 
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.270 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to required in
paragraph

00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
4 and I believe that that's paragraph 4
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
of RSA 374
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
34- a i don't know if we need to maybe
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
include that RSA reference in
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
there this paragraph 4 is just kind of
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
hanging out there um so I'll leave that
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
to the um wisdom of the chair to decide
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
well there is no paragraph 4 in RSA 365
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
colon 37 expensive
 
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
investigation so I think it's reasonable
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
to conclude that paragraph 4 refers
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
a I think it's clear enough as as
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
written all right and then I will as I
 
00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:38.839 align:start position:0%
said I'll thanks for for bringing that
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
that to our attention and questioning
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
that and then the last one okay is um
 
00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.069 align:start position:0%
that and then the last one okay is um
the

00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
um we we we have these criteria that um
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
the formula need to um comply with um
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
fully compensate poll owners for a
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
portion of costs maintaining operating
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know etc etc um some of those are
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
fairly subjective who's going to be the
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
arbitrator of whether they have
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
accomplished the mission or
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
not how do we know that in fact um it
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't discriminate against one
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
attaching entity or that it's
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
transparent I mean is there do we need
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
to have some
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
arbitrator one would hope I wouldn't
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that the investigation will
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
figure that out and will provide that
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
information as part of its report would
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
that be a reasonable expectation
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Elms uh yes under reading
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
this it would be the department that
 
00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:41.319 align:start position:0%
makes a determination there and moves
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
forward with with the the um
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
investigation makes that recommendation
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
to uh the legislature puts this in front
 
00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
of the Pu and then jail car would have
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
oh you have one more sorry so um I'm I'm
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
out a roll today and now I owe
 
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
Harrington double so um so ultimately if
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
if there was some concern about the the
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
formula it would be jail car that would
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
say no we don't think that that meets
 
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.990 align:start position:0%
say no we don't think that that meets
the

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
criteria that that would certainly be
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
one opportunity and there might be
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
others through the puc ru making well
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
good now we know who's buying drinks at
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
lunch thanks okay represent Harington
 
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
okay I um I have a real problem with
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
this okay um what we're saying here is
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
conduct a formal rule making to
 
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
incorporate the formula developed by the
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
department so we're telling the Pu you
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
must do this whatever the department
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
comes up with and under 541 A3 for
 
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
making rules it says you have to hold a
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing receiving comments well
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
if you've already made if we told we're
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
telling the Pu you have to do ABC what's
 
00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
the point of having a public hearing and
 
00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
giving comments you comments going to
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
Comm in you can just throw them in the
 
00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
trash I think this needs to be changed
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
to say conduct a formal rul making in
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
consideration of the formula developed
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
but the Pu has the authority to do this
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
by by themselves and they are not going
 
00:41:23.069 --> 00:41:23.079 align:start position:0%
to be they should not be dictated by the
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
department of energy and it makes kind
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
of a fce under this rulemaking process
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're saying everyone talks about Jael
 
00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
car I mean let's face it most of us have
 
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with gel car they are not experts
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
on um pole attachments or anything else
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
to do with poles or electricity or
 
00:41:42.589 --> 00:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
telephones they they know the rules but
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
that's all and my point is here it says
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
holding a public hearing and receiving
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
comments if you're going to do that then
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
you have to give the Pu the flexibility
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
to make changes to whatever comes out of
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
that formula because right now it says
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
you you will incorporate it as is period
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing who cares if
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
anybody shows up throw all the comments
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
in the in the uh trash bucket I I can't
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
go along with
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
this well I appreciate your
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation but I would respectfully
 
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
disagree the ru making process which is
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
outlined pretty extensively in RSA
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
541a says that the department creates
 
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
rules which intended to accomplish the
 
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.710 align:start position:0%
rules which intended to accomplish the
legislative

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislation that spurred
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
the development of the rule
 
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.190 align:start position:0%
the development of the rule
correct

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
and so the department or the Commission
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
in this case would develop the rules to
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
try to implement the legislative intent
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
legislation and then you have to have a
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing so that the interested
 
00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
parties can look at the rules you came
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
up with and say yes you did achieve the
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
legislative intent or intent or no you
 
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
didn't achieve the legislative attent
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
intent so I think this covers the
 
00:43:10.839 --> 00:43:12.390 align:start position:0%
intent so I think this covers the
process

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
correctly now we could disagree I
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
suppose about whether this is
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
forcing the commission to
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
do the exact formula that the doe
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
investigation comes up with
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
or maybe the DOA investigation comes up
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
with with some flexibility in the for
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
formula that it suggests and lets the
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
commission uh have some leeway in the
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
development of the rules either way I
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
think the legislative intent of this
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
bill is to make it
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
happen representative McGee thank you um
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
so I just started doing a little
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
searching on the references to the rsas
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
in here um and I'm looking at the
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
general regulations under chapter 374
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
for pole attachments which is 374 colon
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
34- and what's interesting to me is it
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
seems like there's already been a stab
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
at uh at this what we're doing it's
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
already in this um in this RSA and so
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm concerned for whether we're
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
trying to reinvent a wheel here it it
 
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:32.359 align:start position:0%
says under this poll attachment sections
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
uh starting on section two which is when
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
there's a disagreement between the
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
parties it says whenever a poll owner is
 
00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
unable to reach an agreement with a
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
party seeking poll attachments the
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
commission shall regulate and enforce
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
rates charges terms and conditions for
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
such poll attachments with regard to the
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
types of attachments regulated under 47
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
USC section 224 which is what you were
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
saying Chris is that there there already
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
is sort of a standard that they refer to
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
um to provide that such rates charges
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions are just and
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable so that's already in here the
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
authority uh shall include but not be
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
limited to the statutory regulatory
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
Authority referenced in 47 USC section
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
224 C and then section three goes on to
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
say the department of energy shall adopt
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
rules under RSA
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
541a to carry out the provisions of this
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
section including appropriate formula or
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
formula for appropriate uh apportioning
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
costs and shall adopt rules under RSA
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
541a implementing the provisions of One
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
Touch Make Ready the otmr as adopted by
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
the Federal Communications Commission in
 
00:45:46.549 --> 00:45:46.559 align:start position:0%
47 CFR so and they give the reference
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
there so it it already says here what
 
00:45:54.549 --> 00:45:54.559 align:start position:0%
the department versus the Pu should be
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
doing it I mean I don't want to read the
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
whole thing to you but
 
00:45:59.470 --> 00:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say in exercising
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
Authority Under the subdivision the
 
00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
department of energy shall consider the
 
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
interests of the subscribers and users
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.990 align:start position:0%
of the
services

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:46:10.549 --> 00:46:10.559 align:start position:0%
um offered such uh via such attachments
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
as well as the interest of consumers of
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
any poll owner um providing such
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
attachments so it it already kind of
 
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.990 align:start position:0%
attachments so it it already kind of
lays

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
lays
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
out how it's supposed to work so I'm I'm
 
00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
wondering whether this is and this piece
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
comes in as section nine starting on
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
five of the amendment line five of the
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
amendment so there are eight sections
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
here and this would just be tacked on
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
below that so all it accomplishes is to
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
say that the doe now has to create an
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
investigation in order to try and come
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
up with a process that I guess improves
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
on the existing process because there is
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
a process it's just that the Pu is in
 
00:46:58.109 --> 00:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
charge of it if there's a disagreement
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
so does the legislation you're looking
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
at mentioned this multi-part test for
 
00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
dis resolving
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
disputes the what test this multi-art
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
test well
 
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
multi-art uh let's
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
see because during testimony on this
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
bill we heard that what this bill is
 
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:21.640 align:start position:0%
about is coming up with a way to resolve
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
disputes when there when there is a
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
dispute between a pole attacher and the
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
pole owner and the current process which
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
involves a multi-part test has proven to
 
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.870 align:start position:0%
involves a multi-part test has proven to
be

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
ineffective and needs to be
 
00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:40.839 align:start position:0%
replaced Mr chair I believe that the
 
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
multi-part test is referenced in the um
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
the Pu um regulations in the rules but
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.150 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
okay so the problem this bill is trying
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
to solve solve is to try to come up with
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
a dispute
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
resolution process using a formula
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
instead of a multi-art
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
test so that would involve replacing if
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
the multi-art test is described
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
currently in pu rules replacing those pu
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
rules with new rules that
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
use a formula instead of a multi-part
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
test and that I believe is the intent of
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation didn't we now it's
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
legitimate to question whether it
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishes that intent but I think
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
that is the intent didn't we hear
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that there they were uh
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
deferring to the a federal
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
formula so there I mean there is
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
difference currently to an ex to an
 
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
existing formula for poll attachments no
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
without seeing the puc rules M I've got
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
the rule right in front of me do the
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
rules mention uh the formula as part of
 
00:48:58.750 --> 00:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
the multipart test yeah one of the one
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
of the six um criteria is the formula
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
the formula adopted by the P the FCC and
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
47 CFR blah blah blah in effect on
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
October 1st
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
2022 so that's one of it looks like
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's one of the six elements of the
 
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.309 align:start position:0%
that's one of the six elements of the
multipart

00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
multipart
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
test so potentially the intent of this
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
legislation is to remove the other five
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
parts of the multi-part test would that
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
proposition would anybody like to
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
Weston we appreciate you being able to
 
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
answer our question this seems to be an
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
extremely confusing situation and we're
 
00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
having a tough time as you can see
 
00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
getting a total handle on it well we
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to be here
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
and help clarify and answer questions
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
and hopefully simplify this for you I
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
have with me Shan Caroll uh I'll let
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
Sean introduce
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
himself thank you for the record Sean
 
00:50:16.589 --> 00:50:16.599 align:start position:0%
Carol with Comcast and here on behalf of
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
the New England connectivity and
 
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
the New England connectivity and
Telecommunications

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
Association um so to answer the most
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
recent question um the intent as as I
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
see with this leg just is to essentially
 
00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
remove those other five factors and
 
00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:33.799 align:start position:0%
focus on an objective formula that has
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
been adjudicated up to the United States
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um the the other five
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
factors insert um some uncertainty and
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
some confusion into the pole attachment
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
rates that are charged in New Hampshire
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
and so uh the legislation would remove
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
those and focus on a single formula as
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of uh the New England states
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
and most perhaps all of the states uh in
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
the country do um with a single formula
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
based on uh pole owner property records
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
inputs maintenance costs uh pole plant
 
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
costs um things of that
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
nature okay so that's the answer to the
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
question does is the intent of this
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
legislation to remove the other five
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
sure and I would follow up and and
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
remind you that the bill as passed by
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate mandated the adoption of a
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
formula uh in consideration or
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
difference to the absc formula and what
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
we heard from all of you is that you
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
would like additional process in the
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
form of an investigation for the
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
Department to look at
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
outcomes and then in fact based on their
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
analysis and the outcomes as prescribed
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
in this amendment as we read it they
 
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
would then determine whether the
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
adoption of a formula is appropriate and
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
make that determination and move forward
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
and I think we've heard questions today
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
about the sort of I'll call it the
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
division of labor between the department
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
of energy and the commission and I think
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
this goes back to the
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
restructuring of uh the department and
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
the commission uh over the past years
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
and so existing law actually outlined
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
some of that division of labor and what
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
you're looking at in the amendment today
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
I think builds off of what has already
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
been well
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
established excellent thank you okay I I
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
think that gives us some clarity as to
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
where we're going with this um
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative Corman do you have a
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
question for these folks or um no just a
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
comment just a comment uh to play
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
Devil's Advocate uh it's certainly
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
possible to come up with a single
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
formula that actually is a multi-part
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
Formula right you take part a of your
 
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
formula multiply that by zero or one
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
depending on what you want and then you
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
take Part B multiply that by zero and
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
add them all together I mean you can
 
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
have a single formula that's as many
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
parts as you want if you really want to
 
00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
do that and and we would suggest and
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
Sean can can address this I believe
 
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
we've spoken to this before about some
 
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
of the elements or inputs rather to a
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
formula and it is not one size fits all
 
00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:21.799 align:start position:0%
it is not rate setting it is in fact a
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
complicated process with many uh inputs
 
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.910 align:start position:0%
complicated process with many uh inputs
involved

00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah I'll speak to the FCC formula
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
which is the the most widely used um in
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
the region and in the country but it it
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
is multi-art in that it has multiple
 
00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
inputs so you have your pole owner costs
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
that go into it you have the space that
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
an attachment takes up on a pole and uh
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
as related to the usable space on the
 
00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:48.799 align:start position:0%
pole you have the number of poles um
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the attacher is attached to so in
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
that sense it's multi-art in that there
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
are multiple inputs and those inputs are
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
specific to each poll owner own um so I
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that gets to your uh
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
gets to your point or
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
comment representative Corman I think
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we want the doe to do
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
this is so that we don't have to figure
 
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
this out and all its permutations and
 
00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:14.789 align:start position:0%
this out and all its permutations and
and

00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:14.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
mathematical possibilities all right
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you folks for for speaking to
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
us and answering our questions is there
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
another one representative Harrington I
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
just had a a comment in general not not
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
to these uh people um hey thanks you
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
folks y it sounds like we're doing here
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
is we're saying okay go out and and come
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
up with a formula why don't we just
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
because we're the legislature why don't
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
we instead of kicking this to the Pu and
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
making them follow which I still don't
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
think is correct a rule that made by
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
somebody else and you have a public
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
hearing and comments cuz everyone's
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
going to say well someone could take it
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
to court I assume and say well we they
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
have to do what they were told to do so
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
what's the point of a public Hearing in
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
comment why don't we simply just say
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
that the doe will do a study in a report
 
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
and make a recommendation back to the
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislature and then we can decide if we
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
like it we'll say this is what you're
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
going to do and put it in the
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
statute well that's what the original
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
Bill did so you're advocating that we
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
just pass Senate Bill 595 as it came to
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
us from the Senate well I I don't
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
remember exactly what the word words are
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
in it but I think that saying that the
 
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy shall develop a
 
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
formula and then Force the Pu to do that
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
through through a rulemaking process
 
00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
makes a joke out of the rulemaking
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
process so if that's the case have them
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
submit the their investigation back to
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature and then we can say
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
good idea bad idea and we can just put
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
it right in the statute if it's a good
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
idea and we don't have to screw around
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:56.789 --> 00:55:56.799 align:start position:0%
making okay
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
I think the reason we came up with this
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and please committee members
 
00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong about this is
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
that we were concerned that not all
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
parties were going to
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
get an opportunity to comment on
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
whatever formula was developed and so we
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
decided to turn this into an
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
investigation in the
 
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
hopes that that would allow all
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
parties to comment and to provide input
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
and to provide
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
addressed so we have two options here
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
one is we could pass the bill as it is
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
and just tell them what to do as the as
 
00:56:41.029 --> 00:56:41.039 align:start position:0%
the original Senate Bill did or we can
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
pass this amendment and ask the doe to
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
allow all parties to participate in the
 
00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
development of a formula I think those
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
are the choices here representative
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair I just want
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
some clarification on line uh 21 it says
 
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
that the um the authority necessary to
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
conduct this investigation and implement
 
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.630 align:start position:0%
conduct this investigation and implement
this

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
subdivision why are we using subdivision
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
change yeah a subdivision of the go
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
ahead representative McGee sorry I was
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
just it it is hard sometimes because the
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
context of especially the Amendment
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
after Amendment where does it go what
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
does it relate to um the subdivision is
 
00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:33.039 align:start position:0%
on pole attachment formula okay under
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
General regulations so that's this part
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the statute we're talking about thank
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Ms thank you Mr chair
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
I I think what representative Harrington
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
was suggesting and correct me if I'm
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
wrong is that there's a
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
third I rely on that um is is a is a is
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
a third alternative which I think what I
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
heard you say was we have the department
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
do this investigation they come up with
 
00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
a formula then they come back to the
 
00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
legislature we review it and then we
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
decide whether that's something in a
 
00:58:09.789 --> 00:58:09.799 align:start position:0%
separate action probably next session we
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
decide if that's something we want to
 
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.910 align:start position:0%
decide if that's something we want to
implement

00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
so so that so what I think what he was
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting was you know the
 
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
investigation but it doesn't become law
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
until after we've had a chance to review
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
it is that okay
 
00:58:29.069 --> 00:58:29.079 align:start position:0%
well the amendment as written on lines
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
18 and 19 says at the conclusion of the
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
investigation the department the
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
department shall issue a report of its
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
findings to the house science technology
 
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
and energy
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
committee so that would give us the
 
00:58:44.829 --> 00:58:44.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pass judgment on the
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
formula and if we didn't like it we
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
could submit
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
legislation at some subsequent point
 
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
that report probably won't be
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
forthcoming until
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2026 but after that we
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
could submit legislation to fix it if if
 
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
we think it's badly
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
broken got a comment representative
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
Kennedy yeah looking at this I think I
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
mean uh representative Harrington could
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
answer this but if we eliminated the
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
sentence that starts on line 15 then I
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
think everything that people are talking
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
about the last 10 minutes would be
 
00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:31.069 align:start position:0%
about the last 10 minutes would be
accomplished

00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
well that may techically technically be
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
true true
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
but what would then happen to the
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
investigation would it sense I mean it
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
says at the conclusion the department
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
shall issue a report blah blah blah and
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's it that's it so then that would
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
require future legislation in order to
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
implement something correct if we like
 
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
it okay all right thanks for that
 
00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.789 align:start position:0%
it okay all right thanks for that
comment

00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
representative McGee yeah I had just two
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
small thoughts um one is about let's see
 
01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
to put my glasses on because I cannot
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
see um on the line uh on 19 where it
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
says submit the findings to house
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
I thought we had discussed that it would
 
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
also go to Senate enr and I'm not sure I
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
know we discussed it but I'm not sure
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
whether that is appropriate or whether
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
we want to just send the report result
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
back to us so that it's not diffuse in
 
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
terms of a response but I would think
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
they might want to
 
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.589 align:start position:0%
they might want to
respond

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
respond
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
see we did discuss that
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
and because this is a house
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I decided that we wouldn't
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
include the Senate if they want to non-c
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
Concur and request a committee of
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
conference to add
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
themselves we can certainly
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
we would probably uh aced to that
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
request but I I don't foresee a
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
situation in which we would not share
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
our findings with them if they wanted to
 
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.230 align:start position:0%
our findings with them if they wanted to
see

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
them okay and then the other thought
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
that I had was around um SE the section
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
that starts on line 8 which talks about
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
what the Department is supposed to do in
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
terms of an investigation it doesn't
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
list anywhere that uh stakeholders
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
should should be included and to your
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
point that you made earlier one of the
 
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had in looking at how
 
01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
pole attachment rates would be applied
 
01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:39.039 align:start position:0%
uniformly across various types of pole
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
owners is that the smaller owners may
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
have differences that need to be taken
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
into consideration and I'm just
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
wondering whether this investigation
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
should be required to actually include
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
some of the stakeholders so that they
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
have a direct abil you can assume that
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
they're going to be included or you can
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
state that they need to be included and
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
right now I don't think the language
 
01:02:00.359 --> 01:02:03.630 align:start position:0%
right now I don't think the language
does

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
that I believe that if it's in their
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
best interest to be included they will
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are
 
01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:14.309 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are
included

01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.029 --> 01:02:16.039 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I was just going to
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
say I mean do we have to tell the
 
01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
department to include people when they
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
do an investigation I hope
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
not do not I don't believe we
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
do representative
 
01:02:32.029 --> 01:02:32.039 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah thank you um just in terms
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
of the the division of labor that we
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing and I think it's
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
clear in the amendment that the the
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
division of labor as we intended is that
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
the department draw rules and the Pu
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
department dropped the formula and pu
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
developed the rules and I don't think
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem with that because
 
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
after all the
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
legislature determines what our intent
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
is and and the Pu and the department
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
carry those out out so you know I don't
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
see I think we're we're getting down to
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
the weeds of of division of labor if we
 
01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:04.039 align:start position:0%
have a clear intent both of those
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
organizations have to carry it
 
01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:10.039 align:start position:0%
out thank you further discuss
 
01:03:10.039 --> 01:03:11.549 align:start position:0%
out thank you further discuss
representative

01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I just listen to what we
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
just said um we saying that it's not
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
stated that the department has to have
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh input from other other groups but we
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
just assume they're going to do this
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
let's assume one group who thinks they
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
should be involved uh doesn't get
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
involved and or never is never asked
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's no public hearing there's no uh
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
posting it in the uh wherever one posts
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
things these days newspapers internet
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
whatever and then this rule comes out
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
because the rule has to do what the
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
investigation says there's no option
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
there they will incorporate the formula
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
period so there's no public input at
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
least for one entity
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
so next thing you know they go to the
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of uh New Hampshire
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
because that's where the that's the
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
appellant court for the Pu decisions and
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
say we had no input to this decision uh
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
because when they had the rul making
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
they were already told by the
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
legislature you have no option you must
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
incorporate the formula period And I
 
01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
dream would I like to change I would say
 
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
that we stated earlier simply report
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
have them do the investigation and
 
01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
report back to the legislature with
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
saying here's our recommendations and
 
01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
then the legislature can Implement that
 
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
by Statute we don't even need to go
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
comments just a comment on
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative McGee just a comment on
 
01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's comment um
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
on the other Comics yeah because there
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
already is although it's vague there
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
already is a process set up under the
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
poll attachment regulations for when
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
there is a a
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
disagreement um I don't have any problem
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
with us uh delaying and having a report
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
brought brought back to us because it's
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
not like there isn't anything in place
 
01:05:20.589 --> 01:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
um and there were even disagreements
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
among the people who testified in the
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
hearing as to whether what we had was
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
adequate so it wouldn't bother me to
 
01:05:28.829 --> 01:05:28.839 align:start position:0%
have it just be a report that comes back
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
and we take action after we actually get
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
to see what it is that we're
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
implementing so representative
 
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
implementing so representative

Harrington
 
01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.910 align:start position:0%
Harrington
on

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
line 11 there is a
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
phrase one of the requirements of this
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
investigation there is a phrase that
 
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
says be transparent to all
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
parties does not that imply that
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
this investigation would
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
be so transparent that there'd be little
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a party to miss out on
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
participating well I think we're getting
 
01:06:11.789 --> 01:06:11.799 align:start position:0%
a little technical here but transparent
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
means it's published so people can see
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't mean they necessarily have
 
01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
any input whatsoever and I think that's
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
the part that's missing here because as
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
written we're going to have the
 
01:06:26.269 --> 01:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
department come up with something
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully because I know the people over
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
there and I'm sure they'll do a good job
 
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:33.799 align:start position:0%
right Chris and uh but legally they're
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
not required to have any input from
 
01:06:38.630 --> 01:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
anybody on this unless there's some rule
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
under the department of energy I'm not
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
aware of so they can come up with this
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
and somebody can claim oh yeah it was
 
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
transparent I read it on the Internet or
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
I read the report but I tried to submit
 
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
comments and no one would pay attention
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
to me so that's that's my issue here and
 
01:06:58.269 --> 01:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
so I think rather than say we want the
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh Department of energy to basically
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
have the final say on this I think the
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
final say should be the
 
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislature because they can come up
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
with any formula they want based on this
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
kind of vague wording here and then the
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
Pu must incorporate that that wording so
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
I mean and I don't like the idea of
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
saying well if it's bad then we'll pass
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
another law to fix it I prefer not to if
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
when in doubt vote it out so if you if
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
it's a bad law don't say we're going to
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
fix it later on with a good law just
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
don't vote for it to begin
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
with so what would you Advocate that we
 
01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
do with this bill just what I said just
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
get rid of that is as representative
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
Kennedy said get rid of that statement
 
01:07:41.589 --> 01:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
about uh the ru making altogether just
 
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
say they they shall submit the report to
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
the science energy and Technology
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
partial yes I tend to concur with
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative ferrington um thank you U
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
chair uh and I also like representative
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
Kennedy's Simplicity in that's striking
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh section four I think that makes a lot
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
of sense if uh we had uh the poll owners
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
be transparent and open to all parties
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
would that go any distance at all that
 
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
satisfying repr hearing concerns and
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
also I'm looking at 18 and 19 says
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to issue a report uh could
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
we specify what we would like to do with
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
their report pending further legislation
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
or pending put it in statute these are
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:28.430 align:start position:0%
 
further

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
rolds thank you Mr chairman and and I
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
apologize for my uh for my lateness this
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
morning I just had a a family situation
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
I had to take care of um I'm I'm
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
struggling to understand you
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
know why why we have as a committee have
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
become mired in
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
this debate at the at the level that we
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
are sort of debate ating the the
 
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
intricacies of what
 
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
is I to me normal procedure where
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
legislators pass legislation and
 
01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
administrators Implement legislation
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
through proceedings that they are
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
empowered to to do and we have a pu we
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
doe um and when I when I read the the
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we're here to debate
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
this morning I I honestly I come up with
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
it's sort of
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
another way of saying just
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
about the same thing that the bill as
 
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:34.759 align:start position:0%
amended came to us from the Senate
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
except that
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
we we changed uh the tasking to the
 
01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
energy to conduct an investigation well
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
we said they they shall investigate the
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
use of a formula and then they we say if
 
01:09:50.110 --> 01:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
they determined through this
 
01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:52.759 align:start position:0%
investigation but down at the bottom of
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
that paragraph on line 15
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
we use the word proceeding or the the
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
amendment uses the word within 30 days
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
following the close of their
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
proceeding which sounds a little bit
 
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
more formal than an investigation I mean
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the original bill as given to us from
 
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.430 align:start position:0%
in the original bill as given to us from
the

01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
Senate the department was tasked with
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
um conducting a uh non adjudicative
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
proceeding the formula shall be
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
developed by the department in a
 
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
nonadjudicated proceeding within 18
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
months so that was the original bill so
 
01:10:32.669 --> 01:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
I I guess I don't understand why we
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
Twisted it around here to to sort of
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
talk about an investigation but then we
 
01:10:37.709 --> 01:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
call it a proceeding and then we're not
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
sure when they're
 
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
done uh you know should
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
says conduct a u formal rul making and
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
incorporate the the rule but give us a
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
report I mean I again I don't know why
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're so wrapped around the this seems
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
like normal proceeding I I'm inclined to
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
us okay so there is another option
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
here we've discussed the possibility of
 
01:11:13.390 --> 01:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
passing this bill as it came to us from
 
01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:14.550 align:start position:0%
passing this bill as it came to us from
the

01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
Senate we've discussed the option of
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
passing this
 
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
amendment there is a third option and
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
that is we could determine that this
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
bill should be referred for interim
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
study if we're so confused by this whole
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
situation that we can't come up with a
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
solution then interim study is another
 
01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
option I just throw that out there if
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
anybody has any thoughts on that idea
 
01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
please let me know representative
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
partial yes thank you chair I would
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend not interm study this
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
has been kicked around for 25 years if
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity to get some
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
forward progress on it let let's let the
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
department of energy get involved with
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
this and come up with some reasonable
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
suggestions after appropriate hearings
 
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
rather than pull it back into our
 
01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee once again and kick it around
 
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
for another 25
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
years representative
 
01:12:13.149 --> 01:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
Kennedy yeah just repeating myself a
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
little bit if if we get rid of the
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
sentence that starts on line 15 then
 
01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
we're kicking the can down the road a
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
little bit hopefully not 25 years but we
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
will get some input if if people here
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
want to be so involved in all the
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
details you know go over every bit of
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
the formula um you know then we can have
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
them develop a formula and we can look
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
at it next time next term
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
whatever representative
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I I uh concur with the
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative parshall I think we
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
should uh take the action that we're
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
here to take today um and I also feel
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
that uh by voting to Kick the Can down
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
the road as representative Kennedy
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
suggests would kind of M us down in the
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
same process that an interim study would
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of are we really equipped to
 
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
to be getting into the weeds of the rule
 
01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:04.360 align:start position:0%
making and and determine you know is it
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know the different multi-art versus
 
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
formula and you know if if we're
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
charging the department of energy to
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
carry out this investigation I think we
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
can trust that they you know that they
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
are going to do it and I also like the
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
fact that this the way we've laid it out
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the language here it gives them an
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
outcome that we're aiming for in terms
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
of being fair and transparent to
 
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
everybody so you know I'm inclined to
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment the way we have
 
01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.229 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment the way we have
representative

01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
bne uh thank you chairman uh just kind
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
of looking through the original Bill uh
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
passed by the Senate um it includes a
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
lot of the things that we have in this
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
one and um it also uh shall give
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
difference to the FCC formula and which
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have in this one and I was just
 
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.950 align:start position:0%
we don't have in this one and I was just
wondering

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
um I guess I guess I I think the
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
original bill seems to cover a lot of
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
the things and I was wondering what were
 
01:13:59.550 --> 01:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
the reasons that we put this amendment
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
in there was a lot of disagreement about
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
whether the original bill was the right
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
approach that was the reason we
 
01:14:09.629 --> 01:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
considering we're considering this
 
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:12.520 align:start position:0%
amendment representative mons thank you
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I would agree with uh
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative parall and and Kaplan and
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
and I think even representative Kennedy
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
that um I think we've done some good
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
work here we've made some progress in
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
terms of defining exactly what outcome
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
is that we're looking for and i' um I'd
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
hate to um have that all be for not if
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
we did interim
 
01:14:33.679 --> 01:14:35.470 align:start position:0%
we did interim
study

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
okay let me do a straw poll if you're in
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
please okay so interim studies
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
out if you're in favor of the original
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
bill as it came to us from the Senate
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay if you're in favor of the amendment
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing right here please
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
hand so a majority of the committee
 
01:15:17.950 --> 01:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
appears to be in favor of the amendment
 
01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.270 align:start position:0%
appears to be in favor of the amendment
representative

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
partiall uh thank you chair I I would be
 
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
in favor of this if we could make the uh
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
at least the
 
01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:29.239 align:start position:0%
change that represent Cy suggested um
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
and I would like that to be an option as
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
well yeah I think there are people rais
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
their hand with the Assumption we'd be
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
changing this I just want to make that
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
clear that you know I would be in favor
 
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
if it if we were to make that change of
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
striking uh clause
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
for okay let's see a show of hands of
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
people who would prefer to see the
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
amendment without lines the sentence at
 
01:16:04.750 --> 01:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
okay so that appears to be an
 
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
amendment uh or in favor of an amendment
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
to the amendment so that being the case
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
I guess we're going to recess this
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
executive session and come back again
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
another day with a new Amendment lunch
 
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
again so
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
I think we'll do lunch today but we may
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
not do lunch on that day so
 
01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:31.149 align:start position:0%
not do lunch on that day so
representative

01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
Ms is there any chance we could
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
reconvene after
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
lunch there is a chance but I certainly
 
01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't promise it it's a relative
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
either way we could recess and um but I
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
need to discuss this this amendment
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
change with some other folks before I
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
move forward with it so
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
um so we will recess
 
01:16:58.940 --> 01:16:58.950 align:start position:0%
this executive
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:17:00.310 align:start position:0%
this executive
[Music]

01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
session for today and we'll notice a new
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
executive session on another day it'll
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
probably be relatively soon because
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to start running up against
 
01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
house deadlines soon I'll have to look
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the calendar to see exactly when they
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
are but uh representative uh Vice chair
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas has something to say yes I think
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
I was just reminded by uh Christie that
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
we only have till tomorrow to enact on
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
this bill because the deadline we need
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
to get it out
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
really the deadline is Thursday so it's
 
01:17:38.629 --> 01:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
too late to notice a
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
right may I make a suggestion I vote for
 
01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:43.400 align:start position:0%
the original
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's what I was gonna say
 
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
can we second representative cre could
 
01:17:50.430 --> 01:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
we just pass the amendment in its
 
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
current form and then create a floor
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh we could try that it's that's a
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
um all right so we won't recess then
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is we'll cease this
 
01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
executive session for now and reconvene
 
01:18:12.199 --> 01:18:13.350 align:start position:0%
executive session for now and reconvene
after

01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
lunch by that time we will be able to
 
01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.430 align:start position:0%
lunch by that time we will be able to
decide

01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
whether making this amendment change is
 
01:18:25.870 --> 01:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable and we can even ask OLS to to
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
prepare that
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then uh we can decide we
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
can exec the bill or finish executing
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
the bill then so we will now take an
 
01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
official break from executive session
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
and Recon reconvene
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
at 1:30 we will reconvene at
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
1:30 to finish this executive session
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.719 --> 01:19:23.709 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.719 --> 01:19:53.629 align:start position:0%

business is I am going to withdraw my

03:50:17.189 --> 03:50:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:21.429 --> 03:50:21.439 align:start position:0%
1850 um I'm going to I'm going to
 
03:50:25.710 --> 03:50:25.720 align:start position:0%

amendment 1931 H 1931 H right sorry
 
03:50:33.030 --> 03:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay got the number wrong okay so
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
that motion is withdrawn now we're open
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
to uh further amendments and I would
 
03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
recognize representative McGee to make a
 
03:50:44.110 --> 03:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
new motion I'd like to make a motion
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
that we accept Amendment 20241
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
195h recognize Vice chair Thomas second
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded that we adopt the
 
03:50:54.479 --> 03:50:57.469 align:start position:0%
moved and seconded that we adopt the
amendment

03:50:57.469 --> 03:50:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:00.630 --> 03:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
19508 so what this amendment does is on
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
line 16 and
 
03:51:07.590 --> 03:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
17 after the word formula it adds the
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
phrase that gives consideration to the
 
03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
and then on lines 19 and 20 it adds the
 
03:51:21.309 --> 03:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
phrase and the Senate energy and natural
 
03:51:24.149 --> 03:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
resources committee those are the only
 
03:51:27.790 --> 03:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
two changes that the amendment makes
 
03:51:31.349 --> 03:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
and representative Harrington deserves
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
the credit for suggesting the phrase on
 
03:51:35.870 --> 03:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
lines 16 and
 
03:51:38.269 --> 03:51:38.279 align:start position:0%
17 that gives consideration to the
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
report delivered by the
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
department because he thought it was
 
03:51:46.149 --> 03:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
important to indic
 
03:51:48.630 --> 03:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
that the commission is not being forced
 
03:51:51.670 --> 03:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
to do something but they're just giving
 
03:51:53.349 --> 03:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
consideration to the department
 
03:51:55.750 --> 03:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
delivered report delivered by the
 
03:51:58.990 --> 03:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
department so I'm interested in hearing
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
the committee's reaction to this new
 
03:52:05.790 --> 03:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Vice chair
 
03:52:08.110 --> 03:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh based on what we discussed
 
03:52:09.429 --> 03:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning and what we heard
 
03:52:12.550 --> 03:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
just now I'm fully in favor of
 
03:52:15.670 --> 03:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
it representative Thomas
 
03:52:18.189 --> 03:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
yes not trying to be pedantic here but
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
um the previous um Amendment said that
 
03:52:21.359 --> 03:52:22.990 align:start position:0%
um the previous um Amendment said that
it

03:52:22.990 --> 03:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:52:25.469 --> 03:52:25.479 align:start position:0%
uh it on line
 
03:52:29.189 --> 03:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
17 um the formula developed was in the

but and while I agree with
 
03:56:13.269 --> 03:56:13.279 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas that the the
 
03:56:16.510 --> 03:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
wording of that last phrase is a little
 
03:56:20.750 --> 03:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
bit awkward uh it gets the job done so
 
03:56:24.110 --> 03:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
let's move forward with it and uh
 
03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
