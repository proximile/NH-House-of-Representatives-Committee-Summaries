in the state's manual for districts
 
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.769 align:start position:0%
in the state's manual for districts
um

00:11:38.769 --> 00:11:38.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
on how they
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
track especially costs and what they
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
need to submit to
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
Market there's actually two worksheets
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
on calculating especially a
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
and I found it very interesting so it
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
was a present
 
00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.990 align:start position:0%
was a present
formula

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
so there's an example here on this
 
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
example the estimated State average
 
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
expensive with people at this time was
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
just under twenty thousand dollars
 
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
just under twenty thousand dollars

[Music]

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:34.019 align:start position:0%
so if you multiply between 20 000
 
00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:35.579 align:start position:0%
three times three and a half I'm sorry
 
00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:37.250 align:start position:0%
three times three and a half I'm sorry
okay

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
it comes out to just under seventy
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that's the special
 
00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:43.019 align:start position:0%
education in cap
 
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
that was that student's clause
 
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.170 align:start position:0%
that was that student's clause
um

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:54.650 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
to put it more concise when you go
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
through the rest of the worksheet
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
for this particular student the distance
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility comes out against you
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:11.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:17.579 align:start position:0%
the state is not paying anywhere near
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
us wherever the student goes if their
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
education

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.449 --> 00:13:41.459 align:start position:0%
I support this building because I think
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
we're much more Equitable or whether you
 
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:47.180 align:start position:0%
are unhapple in town or
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
not as a well-funded town
 
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:54.980 align:start position:0%
a special ed doesn't have any benefits
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:43.569 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:14:43.569 --> 00:14:43.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
one of the issues
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with of course
 
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
there'll be no appropriation for this
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
we've the budget we've already completed
 
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.470 align:start position:0%
we've the budget we've already completed
so

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.170 align:start position:0%
so
hello

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:56.180 align:start position:0%
hello
 
00:15:01.329 --> 00:15:01.339 align:start position:0%
hey you found your what was lunch good
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
but here it's good to see you did you
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
get my message yeah I did
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
try and read our rules here on this
 
00:15:23.699 --> 00:15:25.970 align:start position:0%
try and read our rules here on this
um

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:39.050 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
so just carry a little further one of
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
the other things that we should know is
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
right now in the coming formal of the
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
way it's part of it exists the state
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
pays 3 300
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
in a differentiated key
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
for students discussion
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
so we're acknowledging that it is
 
00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459 align:start position:0%
they should pay professionally
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
but they're not paying anymore
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay now what we are doing is uh in in
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at 577 and if you
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
recall that dropped it from three and a
 
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:40.220 align:start position:0%
half to it's the special ed age
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:45.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
just as a side note we do I did have
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
communication from representative Heath
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
that she's putting in legislation
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
for the formation of a commission that
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
would be also funded up to 150 000 for
 
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.810 align:start position:0%
would be also funded up to 150 000 for
support

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
to look at the entire package of funding
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
this area of special education along
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
with a differentiated Aid component
 
00:17:15.289 --> 00:17:15.299 align:start position:0%
amount and trying to come up because she
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
she sees it the same what I do is that
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
we've had this issue come before so many
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
times before
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
and there's a number of issues like
 
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
we're talking about spreadsheets just
 
00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:27.419 align:start position:0%
now what would it cost if we dropped it
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
from three and a half to one and a half
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
or two two and a half and what would be
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
the implications for how much we have to
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate from the state
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
um we don't have that information
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
and when I talked to Caitlin in the past
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
she said it'd be more expensive of
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
course for the state in the cad aid but
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
you're splitting that money up amongst
 
00:17:48.289 --> 00:17:48.299 align:start position:0%
more kids now
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
because you're reducing from three and a
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
they're being paid by local appropriated
 
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.549 align:start position:0%
they're being paid by local appropriated
dollars

00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:03.950 align:start position:0%
dollars
yes

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
and some differentiated Aid
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
everybody gets differentiated if you
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
have an IEP
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
which is minimal
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
twenty one hundred dollars twenty three
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
so what I'm basically suggesting because
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
we only have
 
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
a month
 
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.770 align:start position:0%
a month
and

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
we're we're not going to get any dollar
 
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the finance anyways
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
on this and I understand I was trying to
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
look in and there's some reference and
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
rules that
 
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:49.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
well I I thought I'd read somewhere
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere and I'm trying to find out if
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
it had a fiscal note
 
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.070 align:start position:0%
it had a fiscal note
that

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.890 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
can we
 
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.370 align:start position:0%
can we
uh

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
approach doe required doe to provide us
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
some numbers they have the data they
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
they need to make it available to us
 
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
they have to have it they require the
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Rebecca fredenham the state
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
director of special ed
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
um so we did submit a fiscal note on
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
this and the reason that we um said that
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
it was indeterminable is the only data
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
we collect is when the district knows
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
that a student is going to go over cap
 
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
so they're not going to put in a kid
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
um a kid's expenses that are less than
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
cap because they're not going to get any
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
money from it and they have to upload
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
into our system in order to be
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursed so they'll only put in the
 
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
invoices for a student if they know that
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to go up over that cap amount
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
so we don't collect all the expenses for
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
um and welcome and that's not how I had
 
00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
understood it so hence my baffled face
 
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.770 align:start position:0%
understood it so hence my baffled face
um

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
but districts have to track all their
 
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
special ed expenses correct
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
they should be tracking all of their
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
special ed expenses yes they may not
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
necessarily track it individually per
 
00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:33.299 align:start position:0%
child they may say I oops sorry I paid
 
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
for a speech-language pathologist at
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
this amount for the year and it was for
 
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
these 10 kids I don't know if they
 
00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:42.299 align:start position:0%
necessarily would break it down into
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
each child we spent this much money on
 
00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:49.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
so they could have
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
an average number per special ed student
 
00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:58.100 align:start position:0%
in their District
 
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%
our students that have not met the cat
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
yes yes one of the directors in the back
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
but that's not provided to doe no
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
because we don't we wouldn't use that
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
currently we don't use that for anything
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
so all we would use are the funds that
 
00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:15.419 align:start position:0%
they're requesting from us to pay them
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
for special education Aid or court
 
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
how would we know
 
00:22:24.539 --> 00:22:26.270 align:start position:0%
how would we know
what

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
the collective we both local and State
 
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
are investing in Special Ed
 
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.789 align:start position:0%
are investing in Special Ed
too

00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
you're not from the doe but she is from
 
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
so I don't know this but I'm wondering
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
if you can get it from the doe 25 that
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
the districts submit to
 
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:57.140 align:start position:0%
yeah so you wouldn't have it by student
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry Lisa Moody um I'm with the
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
office of finance and data so I overseas
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
special education Aid and court ordered
 
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.270 align:start position:0%
special education Aid and court ordered
payments

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.490 align:start position:0%
payments
um

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:09.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.029 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.190 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
what's what's Caitlyn's group division
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
of educational and analytics and
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
statistics so they get the doe 25 so
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to collect that
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
information but it would be their
 
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
special education costs for all students
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
that are in their District not just one
 
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.230 align:start position:0%
that are in their District not just one
student

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
but that would give you a total
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to get a total cost of
 
00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539 align:start position:0%
special education for the state well
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're looking for we
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
don't need it everybody correct me if
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
you think otherwise we don't need it per
 
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:54.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
no because it's the state average I
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
think it is the total amount divided by
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
the number of students right we need the
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
number of students yes we need a number
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
of students
 
00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:08.710 align:start position:0%
of students
right

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
looking averages
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
I believe you had said that you had the
 
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
average at 32 000. that's what I yeah
 
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
yesterday and you guys can certainly
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
amend that I think that there's such a
 
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
um there's such a disparity in the level
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
of services that are provided you're
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
providing maybe two speech services a
 
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
week all the way up to a residential
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
placement with speech and OT and PT and
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
swallow studies and like there's a huge
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
disparity so it comes out to thirty
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
thousand thirty two thousand dollars a
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
year so that's why why it's I think it's
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
more helpful if you had it individually
 
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
because we could say okay all of these
 
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
kids would now qualify whereas we we are
 
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:51.059 align:start position:0%
saying only these kids qualify for
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
special education Aid but because
 
00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
there's such a range of services it's
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
hard to say like that average isn't
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
going to help us I don't think
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's why we need what we had last year
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
right because that would
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
that would deal with that some somewhat
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
but not completely I mean there's you
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
could have a student who has speech and
 
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:18.419 align:start position:0%
language services but they're also
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
identified with autism they're
 
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
identified with other health impairment
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
there so it it every it's every kid is
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
individual and really those numbers are
 
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
based on the services that they receive
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
because it just adds up as you add more
 
00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.370 align:start position:0%
because it just adds up as you add more
services

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
um just preferred uh assistant
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent from SAU 53 the Pembroke
 
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
area schools I think something to
 
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
consider if you talk about delineating
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
cost per disability area you run the
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
risk of some discrimination factors in
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
there too
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
um so just caution that
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and I can say that you know just from
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
thinking of the kids that we have in our
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
own District you know we've got a
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
student that may be deaf or visually
 
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
impaired that is costing five times as
 
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:03.380 align:start position:0%
much as a student who's intellectually
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
impaired so I think to generalize those
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
categories of disability may be pretty
 
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
categories of disability may be pretty
misleading

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
misleading
 
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
we do know there's a number of states
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
with weighted amounts per disability
 
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
that is part of their formula and we've
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
gone through and acquired that
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
information that's why we did bring
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
forward that uh Bill last year which did
 
00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
have two two categories that's all we
 
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
had in there uh three and one in ten IEP
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
categories in the other and passed out
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
of here with a unanimous vote and went
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
on to finance due to the cost it cost
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
about 15 million dollars more with this
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
and we weren't really jacking up those
 
00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
costs a whole lot in conjunction with
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
actual cost it would have cost to
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
provide the services for a child that
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
had TBI or a child in need an orthopedic
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
support or a child that had a disability
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
which was significantly more than just
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
the old resource room for 30 minutes a
 
00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
day type thing or or even speech where
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
it's you know a group of five kids
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
getting together in in second grade and
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
sitting there for two times a week at 30
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
minutes per time learning their R's or
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
what have you so we know we can do that
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
the concern I think the the hardest
 
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
thing to do though is to get a grasp on
 
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.730 align:start position:0%
thing to do though is to get a grasp on
this

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:27.740 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
this guilt catastrophic Aid category
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
because a lot of these kids are coming
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
some of these kids come in during the
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
course year and you're not even ready
 
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden your small District
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
of 67 kids having to pop in on you like
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
Piermont had at 250 000 plus per child
 
00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
you take the formula and they're still
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the ropes for a lot of money which
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have a trust fund or
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
something set up in the sorrow Reserve
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
set up for that like some of the larger
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
districts do have uh so in knowing this
 
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
this is why I representative Heath and I
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
and she's putting this in she's the
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this legislation that's
 
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
been submitted there's LSR number now
 
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
for it to set up a commission to really
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
take a deep dive into how we're funding
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
special education services there's also
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
an appropriation in that commission bill
 
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
that she's putting forward for support
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
Personnel to help us in that endeavor
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
um which I think is a great idea
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
um because we know that we're struggling
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
and if there's any one issue we hear
 
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
more from school districts it's that of
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
how do I pay for my special education
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
costs it's dragging money from other
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
areas my budget to support this one and
 
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's not good and it's really
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
coming down where I think uh 91a issue
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's an unfunded mandate that's coming
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
out those we know it's Federal so we
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
can't get away but the federal part is
 
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:03.059 align:start position:0%
no longer being funded
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
28 aches 91 that's personal privacy
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
confidence 28a excuse me but uh yeah the
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
feds are way below their 40 initial
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
offerings was even at less than half of
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
that now we're receiving
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
but we're still required to do idea
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I I think Mary's got a good idea here
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
we need to have in a committee like this
 
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
studying for
 
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
three weeks four weeks I don't think
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to come up with a
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
all the information to make a decent
 
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
decision as we would do it through a
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
commission study
 
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.590 align:start position:0%
commission study
yeah

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:45.740 align:start position:0%
what else last night and I thought today
 
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.950 align:start position:0%
what else last night and I thought today
uh

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:51.049 --> 00:29:51.059 align:start position:0%
I thought today we were going to have
 
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
the down doe on January 31st so it
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
retained at the executive session to
 
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:00.260 align:start position:0%
find about paid costs
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know we had to deal with
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
um but I have concerned a lot of the
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
Peaks uh Bill not for the commission
 
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
aspect of it but rather it's just
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
keeping this issue down the road
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
this legislature has in the past recent
 
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.990 align:start position:0%
this legislature has in the past recent
history

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
unfunded expensive items that they did
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
not know the cost
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
they they found me a hundred thousand
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
dollars a million though so they have
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
the capacity and the willingness to help
 
00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
education in their perspective
 
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
this is no more this is more important
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
than likely for little small thoughts
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
are you talking about people
 
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
when these cash property folks come to
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
the door they advise a section of the
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
year they have no option and I
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
understand the federal mandate about the
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
40 we haven't got that we haven't got to
 
00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419 align:start position:0%
ask it down mistake I got all that
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
but this is a chance we have to step up
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
and say you know what
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to help the school district
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
and the youngsters who in need in the
 
00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:03.419 align:start position:0%
school district is actually the property
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
taxpayers they won't really throw the
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I'm concerned about the school
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
district has a full because they the
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
only one they have and I I have
 
00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
and I I think I don't know if if it was
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
it withhold for me or you or or the
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
chair or the scenic seated Democrat know
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to ask doe so we said
 
00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:33.059 align:start position:0%
this last January 31st we're going to
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
ask for these spots and they're going to
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
provide some recommendation
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
now because certainly sitting here
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
saying well we're gonna kicked down the
 
00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
road at the whole cycle we made the
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
commission that comes through
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
well it is going to go for another at
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
least two years we we are just approved
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
a budget and we've appropriated X number
 
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:52.260 align:start position:0%
of dollars for I I don't know what that
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
amount was 30 something million 32 32
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
million somewhere around that
 
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.310 align:start position:0%
million somewhere around that
neighborhood

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
and that's appropriated now we drop it
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
down to one and a half
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to have more kids
 
00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:07.700 align:start position:0%
qualifying for that pot of money correct
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
so it's going to be distributed that
 
00:32:12.289 --> 00:32:12.299 align:start position:0%
limited amount of money is no longer
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
going to be distributed to the the ones
 
00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
three and a half to ten times it's going
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
to be one and a half
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
upwards yeah so it's less money per
 
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.570 align:start position:0%
upwards yeah so it's less money per
pupil

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting Rick that we that we
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair I'm not suggesting that we
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
diminish the three and a half to one and
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
a half
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
I'm suggesting we allow we categorize
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
and allow one and a half to be the
 
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
number and that's the number the state
 
00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:42.620 align:start position:0%
is responsible to find
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
money we yeah
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
this is not the first time we had budget
 
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
items of money not set aside that the
 
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
state found in general funds if this
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
passes is their responsibility to find
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
it let downstairs let the corner off and
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
somebody else find it the money's there
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
we have about revenue revenue I'm
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
talking about this you know I I come
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
from a town that's not as small as some
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
of your folks towns and it still hits us
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
but this this is this is a a a a base of
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
a big foundation and I'm concerned that
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
we just
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
I mean I've been in three years in
 
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
education and I've heard every time in
 
00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I hear about the castle
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
obligated every and moans about
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
it but he had the chance to do something
 
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
about it and we've been waiting and I'm
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about honestly about kicking
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
it down the road again and maybe you're
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
talking out of sorts but it doesn't
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
bother me I think we should
 
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:36.740 align:start position:0%
take some action as As
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
you move forward it's an important this
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
is an important piece it's an important
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
piece with for all the small towns in
 
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which there are many
 
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere in these rules as the
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations we can make in this sex
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
session coming up
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
passing another money Bill I don't think
 
00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to do that
 
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:07.460 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna is there
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
hold on sure sure I I mean there's
 
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of bills that have FMS on
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
them that we will see
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
this coming year
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
so so uh so I don't think that's the
 
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
Restriction but and I'm sorry I was a
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
few minutes late but was there a um was
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
was there an amount a dollar amount that
 
00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:31.270 align:start position:0%
was there an amount a dollar amount that
um

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's been presented that that that
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
sort of sums up what's between one and a
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
they can't have they don't have that
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
information okay I didn't hear that I'm
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
sorry so and that's the point so we
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
don't have it but and then the mayor
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
under they were legitimate why they
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
didn't because the eye collecting that
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
data which makes sense you know it'll
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
click today I can't guess this is a way
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
back nicely known since January 31st
 
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
that that data wasn't collected because
 
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
we want to know the phase of this but
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
this is a retained bill right it's going
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
to come back up and and it's it's a it's
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
a policy bill
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
so so you know not to not to you know
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
put um put Precision over accuracy but
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
um but could we get an idea from the
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
Department you know sort of finger in
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
the wind what we think the differences
 
00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
between one and a half times the the
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
average per people cost and the um the
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
the full cost of um of special education
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
so we can have a better understanding
 
00:35:35.329 --> 00:35:35.339 align:start position:0%
about how much this is how much of this
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
is being borne by the um uh local
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
So currently um for special education
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
Aid as you said it's 32 million um we're
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
just over 32 million this year in our
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
calculations and that's only 700 kids so
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
if you change that number to one and a
 
00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:53.099 align:start position:0%
half you're you're I would I would
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
estimate that you're more than tripling
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
that number of students um I can't say
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
how much how much more but if you're
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
saying that the cost per pupil is only
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to go your cap is only going to go
 
00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:04.820 align:start position:0%
to one and a half times
 
00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:06.900 align:start position:0%
you're you're including a lot of kids
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
that are in in your schools and are
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
participating and they're receiving
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
services in your schools which currently
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
they are not participating in the
 
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
special education Aid pot that we
 
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.609 align:start position:0%
special education Aid pot that we
provide

00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
um so I would say that at least three
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
and a half times more students probably
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
a lot more than that I'm I'm going low
 
00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
on my estimate okay so so so just to
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
just to sort of you know uh you get an
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
idea and this is again this just finger
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
in the wind So So currently we're
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
spending 30 it's 32 million dollars
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
which are essentially the 20 plus the
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
10x group yep
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
um uh 20 above three and a half and then
 
00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
100 above 10x and but 100 above one and
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
a half times could be in the 200 250
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
yes because you have to think we have 30
 
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
000 in special education students and
 
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
we're only covering 750 of them
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
approximately with that special
 
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
education Aid so you're yeah it's going
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
to go up drastically because you're
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
going to come we're going to cover a lot
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
more students
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I would say you know you would cover
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
and right now they're total cost of like
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
82 million for all students right for
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
the qualifiers for special education
 
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
their total costs come to 82 million for
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
the for the students that would
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
currently qualify for for or or where
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
districts are getting some relief
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
through the special education uh Aid
 
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:39.109 align:start position:0%
through the special education uh Aid
okay

00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:41.890 align:start position:0%
okay
foreign

00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:41.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I got this right or not
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
so you I believe you said special at
 
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
eight now is 32 million for just over
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
700 students obviously those are the
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
and you as representative Luna said
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
finger in the Wind
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
think three and a half times more
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
students than that at least if we change
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
to this formula at least yes
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
would it be correct to
 
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.710 align:start position:0%
would it be correct to
[Music]

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
um to understand that
 
00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
those students are less expensive per
 
00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:26.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
there's just so many variables here we
 
00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
unless we were able to get all of the
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
data from each district but as I said I
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if you track it by individual
 
00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:38.710 align:start position:0%
don't know if you track it by individual
student

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
because the only ones they're tracking
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
individually are the ones they know they
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
can get money from us to help them out
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
with their bills so they would track
 
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
their special education Aid students
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
they would track their court order
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
replacement students but other students
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
there's I think maybe one or two
 
00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
districts that track all of their kids
 
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
to determine I think that's right if
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
they can get special education aid for
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
some of their other students I could be
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
wrong Jess could speak to that but um
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
I I think it would be a harder number to
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
them not we do not track individual
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
costs for every single student
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
um I have gone through and tracked all
 
00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
of our districts costs as a whole so
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
I've gone through and said all right we
 
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.190 align:start position:0%
I've gone through and said all right we
have

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
52 students in this one school that that
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
are qualifying for special education
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
here are all the related service
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
Personnel here all the special Educators
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
and here's how much that total is here's
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
the average cost per student for that
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
school but to break it down you'd I'd
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
have to go through every single IEP
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
calculate the hours calculate the
 
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
minutes and then calculate that based on
 
00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:46.619 align:start position:0%
the salaries per individual so we don't
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
track the individual student costs but
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
the group as a whole we do I do anything
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
would you or that inspire you any of the
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
three of you
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
would you know how frequently districts
 
00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339 align:start position:0%
do the aggregate accounting that you've
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I could speak to all of
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
them I know I did it because I was
 
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
concerned about the cost of our special
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
education programs
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to know on average how
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
much each building was spending on
 
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
special education and if there were huge
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
influxes why
 
00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:25.619 align:start position:0%
um and really it was our at a district
 
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
costs that spurred those conversations
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't even like the school-based
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
programming that spurred me to do that
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
it was the cost that we're spending for
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
our out of District costs that's what
 
00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.339 align:start position:0%
spurred me to do that because I wanted
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
we were over spending in one building
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then under spending in another
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
building and what the reason would be
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
for those things
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that
 
00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:50.339 align:start position:0%
a big portion of our costs are
 
00:40:50.339 --> 00:40:52.010 align:start position:0%
a big portion of our costs are
transportation

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
it's not even Direct Services that are
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
given to students in special education
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
it's Transportation One specialized
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
transportation for a student can cost
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
around eighty five thousand dollars and
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's about average
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
is that for a student who's receiving
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
education out of District not
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
necessarily so if there are barriers to
 
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
a student
 
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
to get to school and they have an IEP we
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
are required by a lot of transport them
 
00:41:23.329 --> 00:41:23.339 align:start position:0%
to school so there there is a mix yes it
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
is for students who go to out of
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
District placements but it is also for
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
students who attend the local Lea
 
00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.030 align:start position:0%
students who attend the local Lea
um

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
and okay hold on
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
um I want to read a rule here rule 45
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
that for the house rules here
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
and it says reporting a bills committee
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
reports retain bills interim study as a
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
second year report
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
printing uh of committee reports and
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
amendments part one are in compliance
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
with this all bills in The Possession
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
committee shall be reported out by the
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
date specified in rule 66 when one of
 
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
the following recommendations we can
 
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
either recommend ought to pass
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment inexpedient
 
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
to legislate refer for interim study or
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
recommend but the past uh uh let's see
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
recommend but to be laid on the table
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
because of funding
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
this is a funding bill so if we
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
recommend go forward this is going to be
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
put on the table
 
00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
basically it's dead
 
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
or you can interim study it and there
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
would be a study conducted
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
but because of the budget already being
 
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:40.140 align:start position:0%
defined there will be no additional
 
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.390 align:start position:0%
defined there will be no additional
dollars

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
in the biennium we just passed the
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.210 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
you know we have two options here one to
 
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
study it as this committee right here
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
or to recommend not to pass and then
 
00:42:58.370 --> 00:42:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's going to be put on the table
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
or we go with representative Heath spill
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
setting up a commission study to really
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
properly look at not just catastrophic
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
AIDs that this bill is but look at the
 
00:43:11.569 --> 00:43:11.579 align:start position:0%
whole thing differentiated a how many
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
kids about 30 000 special ed kids
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
twenty one hundred dollars a piece
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
that's you're close to 60 million
 
00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.309 align:start position:0%
that's you're close to 60 million
dollars

00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
plus adding on the 30 million dollars so
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
we're up close to 95 million 100 million
 
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
dollars for a special ed here
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
it seems reasonable to me that we're not
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
going to be able to get something done
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
in this committee right here
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
we've studied this bill before and I
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
never got the data back from when we
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
asked we tried to drop it down not the
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
one and a half but the two and a half
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
we never got the data back then
 
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.829 align:start position:0%
we never got the data back then
so

00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
I think it needs to step it up a notch
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
from committee to commission and really
 
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
look at overhauling how we're funding
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
special education in the state of New
 
00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.030 align:start position:0%
special education in the state of New
Hampshire

00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
yeah turkey is the third clarification
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
all of it hope is one of the co-sponsors
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
of you as a chair
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
I thought the intent of this bill I may
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
be I may be wrong but I thought the
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
incent of this bill was to
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
um reduce the catastrophic impact
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
end of the annual special ed impact on
 
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
budgets I thought this was to to reduce
 
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
the the times for the catastrophic
 
00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:31.210 align:start position:0%
the the times for the catastrophic
impact

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:31.220 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
stop in that point right there if you're
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
a small different District like a
 
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.970 align:start position:0%
a small different District like a
Paramount

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
Paramount
 
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
you're you're hammering them more
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
because by reducing to one half we've
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
just been told the number of kids
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
qualifying for cat Aid is going to
 
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.870 align:start position:0%
qualifying for cat Aid is going to
increase

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
that limited pot of money is going to
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
then be spread over all those kids and
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
the amount that Paramount would have
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
gotten it's going to be less
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
and they don't have a reserve fund and
 
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
they don't have other special ed kids
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
which are going to capture any funding
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
based upon differentiated Aid which is
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
limited amount of money to begin with
 
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
the best pay if I may isn't that based
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
on the number in the budget right now
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so let's assume that there's
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
no number so some of the intent the
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill if I understand it
 
00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
correctly and you may hear the
 
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
corresponsible I may be wrong but
 
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
thought the attemptive bill was to set a
 
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
number one and a half to two and a half
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
move down to three and a half times the
 
00:45:31.089 --> 00:45:31.099 align:start position:0%
catastrophic eight so that that
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
districts have a better chance of
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
surviving after their school budget set
 
00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
and they have something to come in so
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
they aren't paying waiting for three and
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
a half it's a two number or a two and a
 
00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:42.470 align:start position:0%
a half it's a two number or a two and a
half number

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
half number
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
I wasn't talking about well you can do
 
00:45:47.089 --> 00:45:47.099 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to just set a
 
00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:49.220 align:start position:0%
policy and put an effective date of
 
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
2026. or something
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
that that is something that's a step
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
forward this is year four and we don't
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
we still live in the same goal Rick this
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
is my point the only problem in special
 
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
ed okay in terms of funding I don't
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
think it is
 
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
so but this is that may not be the only
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
problem especially I would concur with
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
you however this is a problem as one we
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
can address
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
policy wise
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
so respectfully I don't think it's
 
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
either or
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
we could support this bill
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
we have the language you just noted that
 
00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
it can't go into place until funding
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
is appropriated and we could also
 
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
support Mary Hughes study commission to
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
look at the whole broad picture
 
00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:41.540 align:start position:0%
for instance looking at
 
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
the reality that the state can
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
if they don't fund enough not
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
supply all the CATE at whatever formula
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
is being used they Supply whatever
 
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
I think we should do both
 
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
I also want to note that it's not quite
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
accurate to think that this is only
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
affecting the small towns and gosh knows
 
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
I really want to help the small towns
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
but actually it's all the towns
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
23 percent of Education funding is
 
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
Special Ed
 
00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:18.380 align:start position:0%
across the board Portsmouth is 21
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're not a little small poor town
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's everywhere
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the little towns but
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I I agree this the system has
 
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
to be fixed but do we have command of
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
everything we need to for example if
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's going to be three and a half eight
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
and a half whatever
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
that money's being used to support a
 
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
what do we do in terms of auditing or
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
going out there and evaluating ensure
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
those IEP goals are being followed at
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
that residential placement let's say in
 
00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.550 align:start position:0%
that residential placement let's say in
Massachusetts

00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
or in Tennessee
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
so the responsibility Still Remains with
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
that residential Lea so if the student
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
comes from Pembroke and they go to
 
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
Tennessee to go to school it's still the
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility of where that child
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
resides which is in Pembroke to ensure
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
great on paper
 
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.230 align:start position:0%
great on paper
but

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know the visitation never happens
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent a hall thank you I'm
 
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
finding it hard to believe that this
 
00:48:32.569 --> 00:48:32.579 align:start position:0%
data can't be
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
can't be collected right I mean can can
 
00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:38.099 align:start position:0%
you make can you can the doe ask special
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
ed directors individual
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
directors to come up with this
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
information I mean to sit back and
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
always never know what that number is an
 
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
estimate or something we other than what
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
you just gave us which is not really
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
accurate probably unless um there was
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
something unless there was something
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
within that language I have no authority
 
00:48:58.550 --> 00:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
to ask them for that because I'm not
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
using it for anything I have the
 
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
authority to ask them when they apply
 
00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:03.720 align:start position:0%
for special education Aid because I'm
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
reimbursing them for that but I don't
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
have the authority to say you need to
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
give me each individual child's costs I
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing there's no language that
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
says that I can ask them for that and it
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
would I think it would take them a while
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
to do that as Jeff said it's not
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
something that she does
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
um you'd have to go and we do it this is
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
what we do for special education Aid we
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
it takes us from July until December and
 
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
we go through every single IEP and every
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
single service and correlate it to every
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
single invoice there are four people we
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
typically hire four people to do this
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
and that's their job for those six
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
months is to go through and correlate it
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
so is this number never going to be
 
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
known unless it goes into effect and
 
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:47.420 align:start position:0%
then we'll find out
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
authority to ask for it so unless it
 
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
went into effect then they were then I
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
could ask them for it when they applied
 
00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
I don't have the authority to ask them
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
for that and it's I think it would be
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive to try to get them to
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
to do that to submit to us
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
I think the closest thing that is
 
00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
readily available like uh was alluded to
 
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
before was the doe 25
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
um so the special education directors
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
across the street estate every year
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
optionally fill out what we call the
 
00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
special ed cost survey and so we review
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
our doe 25 which gives us a whole cost
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
of special education and we answer a
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
variety of questions that ask number of
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
students those kind of things
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
um and there's some formulas they put
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
into these questionnaires and it comes
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
out it spits out what our average cost
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
for special education is each of those
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
districts the survey is optional we
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
don't have to fill it out but there is a
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place to gather some
 
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
baseline data but it won't give you
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
per cost per kit it gives you an average
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
but there is a survey that exists I know
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
I have filled it out every year for the
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
last four years
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
so and that will go back to the average
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
cost that we have been asked about we
 
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
could give you the average cost but it's
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
not going to give you that higher that
 
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
low or individual student possible
 
00:51:10.609 --> 00:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.849 align:start position:0%
 
um so

00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:51:16.859 --> 00:51:17.630 align:start position:0%
um so
um

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
just a just a couple thoughts on the
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
conversation that we've been having here
 
00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:23.950 align:start position:0%
conversation that we've been having here
too

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
I I think it probably would I mean if if
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
a bill like this were to pass
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
I think um that's a that's an
 
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
alternative to prorating all the
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
payments in districts by a substantial
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
amount because obviously there's more
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
pupils involved that the department
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
could go to Detroit fiscal committee and
 
00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.370 align:start position:0%
could go to Detroit fiscal committee and
request

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.170 align:start position:0%
request
um

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:47.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
for that print so I mean there are I
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
think Provisions in in state government
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
to um you know where where where money
 
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's that
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
that was not appropriated during a
 
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
during a budget year can be used to
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
handle new expense that that's that's
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
what they call the black hole in funding
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
well the the the fiscal committee and
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
the number of departments all over the
 
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.410 align:start position:0%
the number of departments all over the
state

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:17.339 align:start position:0%
know they're going to need X number of
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
dollars but their budget's only funded
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
at this level they say oh don't worry
 
00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
I'll just go back and say I've spent
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
more than this and I need this and and
 
00:52:29.569 --> 00:52:29.579 align:start position:0%
whether they get or not so I wanted to
 
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
comment on that but I also wanted to
 
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
comment that um that if we um you know I
 
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
think it would be a loss for the uh from
 
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.750 align:start position:0%
think it would be a loss for the uh from
State

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and the lost opportunity if we were
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
to itl 577 and not at least use it for a
 
00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:52.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle to require the department to um
 
00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
to to determine what the cost would be
 
00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
above 1X one and a half to two and a
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
half three three and a half
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
um so that we sort of get those those
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
break points and I think we could
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
probably do that that's an amendment to
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
uh to this bill that is something that
 
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
would would um would make a study
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
commission even that much more effective
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
having having those those numbers
 
00:53:21.059 --> 00:53:22.910 align:start position:0%
having having those those numbers
available

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know I agree with you on that
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative that during the month of
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
July and August we weren't allowed to
 
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.950 align:start position:0%
July and August we weren't allowed to
meet

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
so here we are in the month of September
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
dealing with this heady issue which we
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
know was a tough one and talking about
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
gathering information you're not going
 
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
to get it you're not going to get it in
 
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
just three weeks time four weeks time
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
we've been asking for Teacher shortage
 
00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:49.140 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get figures on
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
certification and Steve's lucky be able
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
to get you know the first request he got
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
he got 20 percent of the districts to
 
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.770 align:start position:0%
he got 20 percent of the districts to
respond

00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
respond
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
six months later it gotten up to 56
 
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:01.849 align:start position:0%
six months later it gotten up to 56
percent

00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
and that's where it lays
 
00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
and we had the same thing when it came
 
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
to the Emergency Management plans
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
operation plans
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
when we sat in there we're trying to
 
00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:12.780 align:start position:0%
Dole out the 40 million dollars so 30
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
point something million dollars
 
00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:18.300 align:start position:0%
we asked how many have submitted
 
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
20 and ultimate sure I think you know if
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
we were to amend this bill to collect
 
00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:26.339 align:start position:0%
that data yeah we could put a carrot on
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
it too yeah well you got to have the
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
carrot and the only thing you can't
 
00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
compensate the districts and the
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
department for uh for doing the work
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
and this is why I think that
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative he has money attached to
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
her commission study that to get the
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
survey data data you know I I wonder how
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
many surveys are sent out monthly or
 
00:54:52.609 --> 00:54:52.619 align:start position:0%
requests for information of these school
 
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
districts that are understaffed to begin
 
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:55.250 align:start position:0%
districts that are understaffed to begin
with

00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
and you they're sitting trying to
 
00:55:00.049 --> 00:55:00.059 align:start position:0%
process this stuff and you're
 
00:55:00.059 --> 00:55:02.030 align:start position:0%
process this stuff and you're
understaffed

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
understaffed
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
um eighty percent of the salaries are
 
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
they're paid by federal dollars At Doe
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
and so you know I I think that this is a
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
real stretch it's beyond just normal
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
operating procedure and Gathering of
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
data especially when we send the stuff
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
out and we have folks that are not
 
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.230 align:start position:0%
out and we have folks that are not
responding

00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
responding
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
I get that I get that constantly from Mr
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
Appleby I get it constantly from Caitlin
 
00:55:27.359 --> 00:55:28.309 align:start position:0%
Appleby I get it constantly from Caitlin
Davis

00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
Davis
 
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
and and it takes a number of Yanks to
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
try to get the information brought back
 
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
in I bet you get the same thing things
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
don't come in a timely basis but but
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
this bill if it were Amendment could be
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
interact passed on January 4th
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
signed shortly there are certainly
 
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
months in advance of you're in
 
00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.750 align:start position:0%
months in advance of you're in
representative

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
yeah you're not gonna and have that
 
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:56.579 align:start position:0%
information available to a commission at
 
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
the time it starts
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
does this sound like something
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
your eyes are with an interim study and
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
do it it's a in-room study that way you
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
can do it now
 
00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
you'll begin
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
as we said most districts are very short
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
on staff I think it would be extremely
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to get from them not that they
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to provide it knowing that
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
they could get more funding I just think
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
that it goes back to we have four people
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
do this for six months for 700 kids
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
you're asking the entire state to do it
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
for 30 000 kids in every single IEP so I
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
just like I don't know how long it would
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
take I don't know if they have the
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
manpower to do it I I think they would
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
be they would understand why you're
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
asking for it but it's just that's a
 
00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:41.410 align:start position:0%
asking for it but it's just that's a
huge

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:41.420 align:start position:0%
huge
 
00:56:47.089 --> 00:56:47.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
learning data anywhere perhaps
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
that compares New Hampshire special ed
 
00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
costs with the cost of special ed
 
00:56:58.849 --> 00:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the country
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there is I could try to find
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
something for you
 
00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to make more work that's
 
00:57:07.609 --> 00:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
actually easier because I could just
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
reach out to one of my ta providers and
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
say do you have average cost of special
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
education across the states
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
we could get that through the education
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
Commission in the state yeah I mean I
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
think would perhaps be worthwhile if
 
00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
if there's not a large disparity between
 
00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.170 align:start position:0%
if there's not a large disparity between
states

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
then maybe it's at least some
 
00:57:31.849 --> 00:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
perspective on what this bill would cost
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
us to look at you know how is this
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
happening elsewhere
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I do just want to say I fully
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
support representative lunos
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
perspective that if we can figure out
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
some viable way
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
to start getting data
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire sooner and respecting
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
that you you and your staffs do not have
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
time to do that in the schools they're
 
00:57:58.970 --> 00:57:58.980 align:start position:0%
already trying to do more than enough
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
but the commission's not if the
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
commission gets formed what is it going
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
to work with if it doesn't have any data
 
00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to get the data why wait
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
so who's going by what Authority are we
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
yeah passing law which is not until
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:36.260 align:start position:0%
accidental Amendment
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
when January 1st
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
so that's to get started it'll go to a
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
second committee
 
00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:48.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:50.990 --> 00:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
I guarantee it won't make it out of that
 
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
second committee
 
00:58:56.569 --> 00:58:56.579 align:start position:0%
because this this bill has gone to that
 
00:58:59.289 --> 00:58:59.299 align:start position:0%
second committee at two and a half times
 
00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
the bill that's written here right we're
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
talking to collect data right
 
00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:14.180 align:start position:0%
collect data yeah okay
 
00:59:17.329 --> 00:59:17.339 align:start position:0%
so we amend this bill to replace the
 
00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
content of the bill
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
with a request to collect the data that
 
00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
would help us
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
determine how to proceed us or the
 
00:59:25.799 --> 00:59:26.870 align:start position:0%
determine how to proceed us or the
commission

00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
no that'd be strictly policy
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
well there could be there could be a an
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation yeah just to collect the
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
data universe
 
00:59:42.359 --> 00:59:48.349 align:start position:0%
data universe
yes

00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.210 --> 00:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
comparing Apple
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
's because
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
from you that
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
school has this much that they have to
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
fulfill and one person fulfills it but
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's hard to divide it up into what
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
portion of their salary is being devoted
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
to that so we're not we're at we're
 
01:00:08.329 --> 01:00:08.339 align:start position:0%
asking for how much does it cost to do
 
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
this student and you're paying for it by
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's a part of this and it's a part of
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
this teacher and part of this Aid and a
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
part of this thing so I'm not sure how
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
to draw those two numbers together
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
because we're asking for people to do
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
not just math but to change it and to
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
and to put it into different form to get
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
it and they're usually used to reporting
 
01:00:30.839 --> 01:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
it and they're usually used to reporting
it

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
personally that's why I haven't
 
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
collected the individual student data
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
and I've gone with a district average
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
I I mean I could look up and tell you
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
what my average cost per pupil is we
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
identified people in each one of my
 
01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
schools because I calculated it out
 
01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
doing just that but I didn't break it
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
down per hour per kid because that would
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
be a whole different thing and it isn't
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily the scope of what I was
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
looking for and so the problem is we're
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
trying to look at those kind of numbers
 
01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:00.299 align:start position:0%
by one and a half times x but we don't
 
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
know what x is exactly
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right well okay I got a
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
question yes so so the question that I
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
have of listening to all this is
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
when you when you
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
when a school district makes a request
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
do they make a request on a specific is
 
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
their title is there a label is there
 
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
how do you know what you're going to be
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
paying for there's got to be some kind
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
of a uh an invoice or something that
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
says okay this student is going to this
 
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
residential school it's costing this
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
amount this is the request so so what
 
01:01:42.370 --> 01:01:42.380 align:start position:0%
are you actually reimbursing
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
so we have so the districts all know
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
about special education Aid and their
 
01:01:49.849 --> 01:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
student has to reach the three and a
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
half times the estimated cost per pupil
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
and so that estimated cost for pupil is
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
for the whole state and when we're
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
talking about the doe 25 that's where it
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
comes from and so anything over so they
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
put all this information into nessus and
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
then we have a uh
 
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
um behind the scenes it formulates it
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
for us and so our district will upload
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
their invoices and then we're in our
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
review process now and we're reviewing
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
all the district's costs to make sure
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
that's in the IEP and allowable and then
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
we refund them come January 1st so what
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
is a cost so they they submit costs for
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
um the tuition for a residential
 
01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
placement for transportation for speech
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
services for a paraprofessional for
 
01:02:36.289 --> 01:02:36.299 align:start position:0%
anything like anything like that that is
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
going to bring them up over the cap if
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
they're in if they go to another school
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
and they may submit for for the teacher
 
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
cost if they're going to a charter
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
school sometimes they submit for the
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
teacher cost because you're splitting
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
the cost of that teacher between five
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
special education students as you
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
provide services to them so it's
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
anything that is provided to a child for
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
services including tuition is something
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's submitted to us they need to
 
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
submit the invoices and then as as Lisa
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
said they take we take the invoice and
 
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
then we look at the child's IEP and say
 
01:03:07.190 --> 01:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes this says that they got speech three
 
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
times a week and yep their IEP says they
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
receive speech three times a week yes we
 
01:03:13.609 --> 01:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
can reimburse you for that and that
 
01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
child has an identification number
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
correct so it's not it's not specific
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's not specific to any name it's just
 
01:03:23.809 --> 01:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
to an ID number right the system does
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
have their names in it yes the system
 
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
has the names but from an identification
 
01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
standpoint you've got the number rather
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
than the name
 
01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
we have all so we have all of that
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
um typically what they put on an invoice
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
is a student's sacid number yes thank
 
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you so but so if you have
 
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
Mill Myler is as has an IEP and in that
 
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
IEP it says this is what he has to do
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it says and also says
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
um how much teacher luno is spending
 
01:03:58.849 --> 01:03:58.859 align:start position:0%
with that teacher how much that is uh is
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
is cost a cost for that so you you do
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
have that information on an individual
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
so by individuals students only for the
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
students that they are submitting for
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
special education Aid so if they're not
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
going to submit if if if she has a
 
01:04:14.569 --> 01:04:14.579 align:start position:0%
student who she knows is only going to
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
get two units of speech each week she's
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
going to say nope they're not going to
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
meet special education Aid cap I'm not
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
even going to put their invoices in I'm
 
01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
I'm just gonna we're just gonna pay that
 
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
cost because I know it's not going to
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
reach cap so we never see that invoice I
 
01:04:29.569 --> 01:04:29.579 align:start position:0%
have the IEP I have the services I never
 
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
get an invoice from Jess to say please
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
pay me for this because she knows she's
 
01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
not going to reach the cap with that
 
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:35.990 align:start position:0%
not going to reach the cap with that
student

01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
so we only get the students that they
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's the districts know that they're
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
either going to meet cap or come very
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
close to cap so that they can ask for
 
01:04:43.799 --> 01:04:46.730 align:start position:0%
close to cap so that they can ask for
reimbursement

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
how do you break down the expenses that
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
are separated between HHS and doe on
 
01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
these residential placements so we pay
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
the education portion and then they pay
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
the residential portion now
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
what about room and board if they're
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
placed by DHHS
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
if they're placed by DHHS yes
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
and you have that explained to me a
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
little boy if we have in my district a
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
child that's going to receive
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
a placement in a a school that's not in
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
the district for a special IEP needs
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
and going to have to be there 24 7.
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
how's that break down in terms of shared
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
costs there is no shared cost if it's
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
not if they are not involved with DHHS
 
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
is not a shared cost it is just the cost
 
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
of the district so that's all private
 
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
District yep
 
01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540 align:start position:0%
and and uh and you do an do you do an
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
audit of the accounting practice that
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
you know to ensure that they're saying
 
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
this is going to cost 186 thousand
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
how do you ensure that the expenses and
 
01:06:00.109 --> 01:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
what they're submitting to you are
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
associated with the IEP so we approve
 
01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
rates for special educa for private
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
providers of special education each year
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
they submit their budgets to us and
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
their audits to us of the costs that
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
they've put in
 
01:06:14.569 --> 01:06:14.579 align:start position:0%
um over the year so they have the whole
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
form that they fill out that puts in all
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
of the costs that they spent and then we
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
use that to determine their rate each
 
01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:24.170 align:start position:0%
use that to determine their rate each
year

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hall thank you is
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
there a software that you don't own but
 
01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:32.579 align:start position:0%
is it a software that would sort this
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
stuff out there's got to be right there
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
would the you've never heard of any
 
01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
software this is with software
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
um so this is with our New Hampshire
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
special education information system we
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
call it nessus right so all of um all
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
but five districts use nesses to put
 
01:06:49.609 --> 01:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
their IEPs into that and then the other
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
five districts have to put in um a
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
certain number of data points and they
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
have to put in more information if
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
they're putting in for special education
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
Aid so they have all of the information
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
regarding the child in the system and
 
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
then they submit their invoices through
 
01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
the same system and it and we calculate
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
the system calculates what their cap is
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
but then we go back and confirm that yes
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
this invoice matches this IEP and we're
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
actually paying for what we're supposed
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
to pay for so the system does it does
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
track it and pull it all in but then you
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
have to go back and you have to confirm
 
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
because sometimes they'll put in for a
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
paraprofessional and um it's five hours
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
a day and sometimes the IEP only says
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
two hours a day and we can't pay for
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
that extra three hours a day so we could
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
we go have to go back and correlate the
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
IEP to the invoice it's just it just
 
01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
seems like there's got to be something
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
out there this is so easy I mean I've
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
written many IEPs and
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I just find it hard to
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
believe that there's not a sorting
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
system but
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
that would cost money that you don't
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
have something sure just a question on
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
the current three and a half times
 
01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.109 align:start position:0%
the current three and a half times
uh

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
just ballpark
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
how many of those youngsters still
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise are retained in District
 
01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
versus out of District
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
oh I have no idea I mean we could look
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
at it but
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean we could look at the
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
700 kids and see um I would I would say
 
01:08:21.769 --> 01:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
that most of them are residential or day
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
placements in an outside facility right
 
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
but um I could look at the numbers no
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
and I only I always say that not to put
 
01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
you on the spot because
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
grant that I was there the Conestoga
 
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
wagon but when when I was there the the
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
bulk of the cash drop across were
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
youngsters who were were placed on a
 
01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:39.229 align:start position:0%
youngsters who were were placed on a
district

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
so it did so this is you know so a small
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking made a small number of
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
reset cap in in-house yeah so this is
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
the youngsters are moving on somewhere
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
else yeah okay thank you represent dry
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
so if we can't
 
01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
fix things by
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
um moving it from three and a half to
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
one and a half could we change it by
 
01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
paying a hundred percent of the people
 
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
that are getting
 
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
three and a half instead of eighty
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
percent you know I have the department
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
I I mean moving it to one and a half
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
will help them as well I mean yeah but
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
it also opens it up to a lot more people
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying if we did that it would
 
01:09:21.050 --> 01:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
only affect the ones that are the
 
01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:22.739 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid right now it would
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
still affect the same number of kids
 
01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:25.550 align:start position:0%
still affect the same number of kids
because

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.020 align:start position:0%
um you're they all meet cap and then
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
from cap until 100 that they pay 20 and
 
01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:33.900 align:start position:0%
then we pay at 100 percent
 
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm not speaking very clearly
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
so for example if we left it at three
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
and a half so for last year yep
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
um it the total was eighty thousand two
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
cap was 43 000. so
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
um we would be paying them more than the
 
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
30 I mean thousand million than the 30
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
million we'd be paying them 37 million
 
01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
instead of 30 million
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
to them being the district the districts
 
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.050 align:start position:0%
to them being the district the districts
okay

01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
because we don't if we don't have enough
 
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
like what did you say the costs were
 
01:10:12.169 --> 01:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
this year 80 . 87 so if we go over the
 
01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
amount of money we have we have 32
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars if once everything is
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
all verified and
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
um accounted for if we get to the end
 
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
and we say all of these costs are 35
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars we then have to prorate
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
it and the district gets less than the
 
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
80 percent or the um the 100 over 10
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
times so it's all based on it's all
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
based on the total number amount of
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
money that we have oh
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
okay kind of like planning your school
 
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
budget ahead of time you have this much
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
money okay
 
01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
money okay
yes

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
do we have a a way now of of calculating
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
what the average cost of regular
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
education is
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
I would assume so yes I could talk to
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
Caitlin and find that out yes okay so
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
that that well isn't that the that's the
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
cat that's the estimated cost for people
 
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
that's the answer of 1100
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
um the 1100 group right yeah yeah gee I
 
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
can remember that from school board days
 
01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.250 align:start position:0%
can remember that from school board days
so

01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:14.209 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
and then we could also probably
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
calculate an average cost additional
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
cost for special education based on the
 
01:11:21.659 --> 01:11:23.450 align:start position:0%
cost for special education based on the
1200

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
1200
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
group yeah okay
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
so that we could get without any data
 
01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:29.780 align:start position:0%
collection yeah great thank you
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
so 1100 this is from school board
 
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
accounting uh is regular education 1200
 
01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
is special education and 1300 is
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
something else so you're asking for the
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
difference between the average cost per
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
pupil for all students and the average
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil for special education
 
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
right you would want the difference
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
between the two of those yeah and we
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
could pull it from the data that's
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
voluntarily submitted on the doe 25 for
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
special education okay and we could pull
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
it from the doe 25 for for all students
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
no thanks so I think that would be
 
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
helpful to really understand what the
 
01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:08.460 align:start position:0%
what the you know Costa communities are
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
um for special education which is
 
01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:14.219 align:start position:0%
clearly the right thing to do providing
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
special education and is and is mandated
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
to us under uh state and federal law so
 
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.030 align:start position:0%
to us under uh state and federal law so
um

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:26.219 align:start position:0%
you know so and and actually the way the
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
the way 577 is written is it talks about
 
01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
the average cost per pupil one and a
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
half times the average cost per pupil
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
which includes regular and special
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
education and um and it would probably
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
be also good to to look at you know the
 
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
administrative because I think the the
 
01:12:48.649 --> 01:12:48.659 align:start position:0%
all this or whatever it's called if
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
administrative costs are included or
 
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
excluded uh in that so that we really
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
know what the all-in costs are for um
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:13:02.689 --> 01:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
for educating all of our kids so
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
pretty expensive you know when you take
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
the three and a half I'll just take some
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
ballpark figures say the average cost
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars a kit
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
and if you have 700
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
kids that average all in that is so just
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
to get the three and a half points yeah
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
you're gonna be talking 49 million
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
dollars right right but that 20 000 and
 
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
is the average cost of all students
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
which includes yeah the the you know
 
01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.270 align:start position:0%
which includes yeah the the you know
um

01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
83-ish percent
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
regular Ed and 17-ish percent special ed
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
so that's not a right that 20 000 isn't
 
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
an all-in regular
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
it's not a regular at cost no it's in
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
all it's a that's an all-in for people
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
including special education students
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
yeah you just want to try to verify a
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
point I think the
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
um I think I understand where it came
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
from the 32 million dollars that are
 
01:14:05.630 --> 01:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
currently in the budget
 
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
was that a number that was uh
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
established and requested by Doe or is
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
that number that was was uh came through
 
01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.090 align:start position:0%
that number that was was uh came through
Finance

01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
Finance
 
01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
I believe it came through Finance we
 
01:14:19.970 --> 01:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
don't request that amount see Matt can
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
you tell me what you actually requested
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
would you requested we don't request an
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
amount for that when they um just give
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
us that amount each year
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay so that that's totally on the will
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
and pleasure of the finance committee
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
to representative woodcock's
 
01:14:39.179 --> 01:14:39.890 align:start position:0%
to representative woodcock's
um

01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
most recent questioning
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
so how similar or different is that 32
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
million over say the last 10 years has
 
01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
it changed
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
yes because
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
I've been around for a little bit I've
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
been around for like 23 years and so
 
01:14:58.850 --> 01:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
um in the doe I'm much older than 23.
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
so they had at one point taken away
 
01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars or down to 23
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
million and we were prorating like 70
 
01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
million and we were prorating like 70
percent

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
um and so then I don't know
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
not us someone brought it forward and
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
they put more money in and brought it up
 
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
to the 32 million but I don't know how
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
that all worked we're prorating in many
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
subject areas Career Technical education
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
is also prorated uh I can remember it
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
lower than 70 percent
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and when you come to CTS we're
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
actually funding around 56 percent
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
and and so this is across all the fields
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
can I follow yeah so is the current 32
 
01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
million the most that it has been yes
 
01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:55.140 align:start position:0%
but if I understood what you said about
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
three years I think maybe three years
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's been 30 32 million and we've and we
 
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
one year we did 98 but we it's been a
 
01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
and we've come up we were down really uh
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
when it was a 23 million I mean 69 68
 
01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:21.709 align:start position:0%
when it was a 23 million I mean 69 68
percent

01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
right going back 10 years ago eight
 
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
so what we can do is of course we're
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
going to have another meeting on this
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
because this is some committee
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
come up with some kind of sense of
 
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
direction or where we want to go with it
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
um I I suggest too if you have a chance
 
01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
to talk with Mary you talk to her about
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
what she's doing because that's that's a
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
critical component of trying to get some
 
01:16:58.610 --> 01:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
work done as far as funding things
 
01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.709 align:start position:0%
work done as far as funding things
properly

01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:17:00.719 --> 01:17:02.990 align:start position:0%
properly
yeah

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
well Mary put it out to me does you know
 
01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
I said yeah I'll jump right on that
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
but I don't know who she's who else
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
anything else that we need from doe
 
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna put if we're going to ask
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
for this and we're going to put some
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
sort of carrot out there
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
can you make a ballpark estimate of what
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
it would cost the school the schools to
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
come up with the numbers we're asking
 
01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.870 align:start position:0%
come up with the numbers we're asking
for

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
here we lost my time
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's going to take me away
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
from a lot of my other obligations and
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
duties I'll do it if you he tells me to
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
do it I'm certainly gonna do it I think
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
I have a step ahead of the game because
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
I already have a lot of my numbers but
 
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that everyone else does But
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately you'd be it'd be a cost of
 
01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:07.970 align:start position:0%
ultimately you'd be it'd be a cost of
time

01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's a hard thing to find some of these
 
01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.169 align:start position:0%
it's a hard thing to find some of these
districts

01:18:15.169 --> 01:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
like the essay used the co-ops how many
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
directors do you have and they have one
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
director and then a whole lot of schools
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
or towns which are receiving this money
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a lot of different budgets
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
um and I do know that having been in the
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
school district has a principal
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
administrator this is a bad season to be
 
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
putting out another request when you're
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
just starting schools up and you're
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
trying to get some of these things going
 
01:18:42.179 --> 01:18:43.490 align:start position:0%
trying to get some of these things going
smoothly

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
smoothly
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.590 --> 01:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much you might let
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
if you see you're not in the same
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
building as Caitlyn right oh you are
 
01:19:00.169 --> 01:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
back you're over there now
 
01:19:00.179 --> 01:19:01.910 align:start position:0%
back you're over there now
congratulations

congratulations
 
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
you might let her know we're looking for
 
01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything else here we can
 
01:19:14.410 --> 01:19:14.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
it is yeah Escape
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
not seeing any more discussion here
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
we'll adjourn this one and we'll come
 
01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.669 align:start position:0%
we'll adjourn this one and we'll come
back

01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know what I have for time here
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
I I I don't want to go anywhere until I
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
I've talked with Caitlin and find out
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about and some of
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
this spreadsheet stuff we need to know
 
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:46.950 align:start position:0%
this spreadsheet stuff we need to know
that

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.209 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:47.219 --> 01:19:51.530 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
okay yeah and I want I think we also
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
have to really find out what are all the
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
