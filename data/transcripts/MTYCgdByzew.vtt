test
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
yes good morning chairman hunt members
 
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
is DJ beton court and I have the
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
pleasure of serving as the commissioner
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire insurance
 
00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
department I'm joined this morning by my
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
colleague Alex Feld Daval Senate Bill
 
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
173 represents a three-year effort of
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
to synchronize state law with the
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
federal no surprise act and to accept a
 
00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
healthy amount of delegated authority
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
that the federal government has made
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
available to the states to enforce the
 
00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:10.759 align:start position:0%
provisions of the no surprises act the
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
reason that this has taken as long as it
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
has is because there's a lot that is
 
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:17.720 align:start position:0%
included here and we have had to work
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
very carefully and I think very
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
constructively with a number of
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
different stakeholders and at this point
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
we have found a compromise between
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
carriers and providers and obviously the
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
Department itself is satisfied that we
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
now have the ability to provide as much
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
consumer protection as we are able to
 
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
given the Contours of the no surprises
 
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
act so in short not to be repetitive of
 
00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
what Mr bossy said this bill will
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
harmonize New Hampshire's existing
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
balance billing law with the federal law
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
so that we will have one standard one
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
set of standards and protections and not
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
two as currently exists we have
 
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
protections for a more narrow
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
limited set of practices in state law no
 
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
surprises Act is more expansive we want
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
to Simply match the protections that the
 
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
federal government has made
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
available uh just as in the no surprises
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
act it requires Health carriers to cover
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
the relevant out of network services in
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
the same manner as if the services were
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
provided by an in network provider or
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
facility most importantly the bill
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
establishes a state level independent
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process C to resolve
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
disputes about the fair value of Medical
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
Services provided by outof Network
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
providers and I want to stop here for uh
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
two important points for your
 
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
consideration the first is the way
 
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
current statute is in New Hampshire when
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
there is a dispute and you're trying to
 
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
determine what that fair market value is
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
the process is such that the parties can
 
00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:54.519 align:start position:0%
appeal to the department and the
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner whoever he or she may be
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
serves as the oneperson IDE r that was
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
the nature of the compromise that was
 
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
reached in
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
2018 we have since had conversations
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
with both providers and carriers who are
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
a bit uneasy about having one individual
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
have that type of authority so what
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
we've done instead is kind of tried to
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
create a Choose Your Own Adventure story
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the parties uh they can go the
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
independent dispute resolution process
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
at the federal level or they can have
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
the same type of process at the state
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
level and what that looks like is the
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
federal government has contracted with
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
independent idrs they take in the
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
complaint they send it off to the IDR
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
the IDR makes a determination and that
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
determination is binding on the parties
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
we would do the exact same thing here in
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with a couple of different
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
improvements the first is our system
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
will not break down like the federal
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
government system has it's frequently
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
subject to litigation and therefore
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
shuts down uh the federal process has at
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
times been overwhelmed and so therefore
 
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
or they have to shut down to allow for
 
00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
themselves to catch up and we will do it
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
faster and cheaper we have heard
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately of instances where the
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
carrier has lost the arbitration through
 
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
that IDR process and has been very very
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
slow to pay the provider what was agreed
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
upon we obviously will make sure that
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
does not happen here in New Hampshire so
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
as I've said we've worked really hard
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
over a number of years to come up with a
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
good compromise uh we are here and so we
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
hope obviously the committee will take
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
this under consideration and move it on
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
to the governor thank you Mr
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
chairman okay we have questions
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
representative burrow just a second you
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:49.720 align:start position:0%
next is it me or him yeah okay uh thanks
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question if the state
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
level uh arbitration is is chosen is it
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
still just go before you as an
 
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
individual no what we will do as I said
 
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
is we will the department will take in
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
the complaint and what we will do is
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
follow the same process that we have for
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
an external review so for example for a
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
prior authorization that's been disputed
 
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
it will go out to external review a
 
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
third party will determine whether or
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
not the prior R should be granted or not
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
similarly we'll take in the complaint
 
00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
we'll send it off to the IDR that we
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
contract with here at the state level
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
they'll make the determination and then
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay now you inquire um thanks for your
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
time I uh this is anecdotal so uh my my
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
impression has been that um there has
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
been some private Equity investments
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
into uh the medical field Health Care
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
field and and I was just wondering is is
 
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
and I I came away with the impression
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
that that was where some of the conflict
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh happens that's where you get a
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
surprise in your bill and so I was just
 
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
wondering um if you have any kind of
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
comment on um how this is going to
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
improve that sure issue so I can't speak
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
in any detail to the private Equity
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
piece but what I can tell you is how a
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
balanced Bill essentially comes to be
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
and boy you're going to get an education
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
on this later today when we start
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
talking about ground ambulances which by
 
00:13:28.509 --> 00:13:28.519 align:start position:0%
the way may I add is not included in
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
we deal with everything except ground
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
ambulance it's a thorny issue you'll
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
hear more about it today there's a
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
reason why the federal government was
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
able to handle helicopter rides before
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
they were able to handle ground
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
ambulance it's really
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
thorny how a balance Bill comes to be is
 
00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:48.519 align:start position:0%
you will have a facility or a provider
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
who is not in
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
network but it's not readily apparent to
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
the patient that that facility or that
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
individual is not in network so for
 
00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
example you fall someplace they take you
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
hospital we want you to focus on making
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
sure that you're getting the care that
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
you need and you're getting better we
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to have you to have to worry
 
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
about whether or not that particular
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
hospital is in network and therefore you
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
fearing that you're going to get a bill
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
so these protections will prevent that
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
for emergency room visits and other
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
things like that but what happens is is
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
that the insurance carrier will have a
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
minimum allowed amount by which they
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
will pay an out of network provider
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
so whatever the bill is they'll have a
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of that that they'll
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
pay but there'll be a Delta between what
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay and what the bill
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
is and the balance of that is ultimately
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
what goes to the consumer and those are
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
the types of things that we very fearful
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
of because number one in many instances
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
it's out of the patients hands and
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
number two they have no idea that it's
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
coming and some of these balanced bills
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
can be really large bills and can be a
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
real Financial strain on patients so
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
that that is our concern and those are
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we want to bring these
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
more expansive protections to the state
 
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
level the other common thing that we see
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
that again is dealt with to a less
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
degree in current state law but will be
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
dealt with more comprehensively with
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
passage of Senate Bill 173 is you'll go
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
in for surgery the facility is a network
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
the doctor the surgeon is a network but
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
the anes theologist is not and so there
 
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
again we don't want the patient to be in
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
the position of sitting there on the
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
table getting ready for surgery and say
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
okay doctor I know you're in my network
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
but ma'am who are you and are you in my
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
network I mean that's an absurd scenario
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
to put a patient in so again that would
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
that would be uh addressed through
 
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill Keith can I follow
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
up oh followup
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
um now that this is going to be come law
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
here um is there any
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
um opportunities for additional funding
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
if you have run
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
into a lot of issues that take some time
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
from the federal government so we're
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
always seeking out opportunities to take
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
advantage of resources that are
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
available I think the state Prides
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
itself on getting good return on
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
investment from the federal government
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly do our part uh to
 
00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
advance that what I can say is is we're
 
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
not anticipating a Lar large number of
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
appeals to come through so again we've
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
had state level balance billing
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
protections on the book since in in
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
effect since 2019 passed in 2018 went
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
into effect in
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
2019 to date the insurance department
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
has received a grand total of zero
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
requests for us to arbitrate a dispute
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
and the reason why in my opinion and my
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
theory on this is because the parties
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
don't want us to be the ones who decide
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
the dispute because once you start doing
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
that you start setting precedent for a
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
fee schedule which the parties in many
 
00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
cases do not want so the incentive is
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
there for both sides to negotiate with
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
themselves reasonably and come up with
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
what is actually a fair value for those
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
Services we think that some of those
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
Dynamics are still going to be very much
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
in play with the passage of 173 though
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
the dispute resolution process will be
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
different representa Pella did you have
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
a question and then representative
 
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
Spears yes um thank you for taking my
 
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
question so I wanted to know about the
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance so that's definitely
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
excluded that is excluded air is
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
included air and then I have a followup
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
about actually how balanc sure work so
 
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
100% ground ambulance is not dealt with
 
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
in this bill again we'll talk about that
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
later today yes that's a separate issue
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
when the no surprises Act initially
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
passed it did deal with balance billing
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
issues related to um air ambulance uh
 
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
helicopters uh the dart U uh program
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I think is
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
something you may be familiar with um my
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that was subject
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
to some litigation and again don't quote
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
me on this but I think they ran into
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
some issues with how the no surprises
 
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
act impacted FAA regulation
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
and that was where the rub came in so I
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
think that has since Fallen away but
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
again I humorously noted that the
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
federal government was able to come up
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
with a proposed solution to air
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
ambulances before they were able to deal
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
with ground ambulances okay which I have
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
like a real all right so my real
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
question is can you help
 
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
summarize not what is in current statue
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
but for this bill can you help summarize
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
um what is there what is the changes to
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
the balance billing and what are you
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
recommending now that the insurance
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
companies do between out of network in
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
network can you just summarize for us
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
exactly what this bill is doing sure so
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
for me there are two main issues and
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
then Alex can maybe give his to for me
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
the two big issues are it synchronizes
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
state law with federal law so you're
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
going to have the same protections
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
whether you're dealing with a fully
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
insured plan which is dealt with by the
 
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
federal government or whether you're
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with a self-funded plan excuse
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
me fully is US self is the federal
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
government will have the same basic
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
protections um so that's consistent so I
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
think that's going to improve uh doing
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire that you're
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
not going to have two sets of Standards
 
00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:48.039 align:start position:0%
the second big thing that I would point
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
out is the independent dispute
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
resolution process again while you'll
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
have the option to go the federal or the
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
state route the process itself will be
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
the same so again we're synchronizing
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
and we're harmonizing ing what the no
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
surprises act provides with State
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
Statute Alex do you have some others yes
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would emphasize um
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
beyond that is that by harmonizing with
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
the federal no surprises act we are
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
expanding the footprint of the state no
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
surprises act um the state as it exists
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
um only applies to uh when you go to
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
inetwork hospital and then you see an
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist or radiologist or a
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
lab um through this harmonization
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
process it'll be any provider who's out
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
of network if you're an in network
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
Hospital you'll be covered by the
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
prohibition on balanced billing and then
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
it also deals with any emergency
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
services that you receive at a
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
non-participating provider so it's a
 
00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:50.919 align:start position:0%
bigger footprint and it lines up with
 
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
the federal law and then representative
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
I remember the last portion of your
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
question there what I hope this will do
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
is is to further encourage carriers and
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
providers to negotiate with each other
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
to get in network because once you're in
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
network you don't have to worry about
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
any of these things you have an you know
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
you've got a contract you've got a
 
00:21:12.909 --> 00:21:12.919 align:start position:0%
negotiated rate you're Off to the Races
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
it's smooth sailing U so hopefully this
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
bill will be a further incentive for
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
those types of conversations to take
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
place okay last one um and help us
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
understand what segments of the insured
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
population right there's lots of
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
segments so is this everybody or just
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
certain segments so for fully insured
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
which is what we regulate those fully
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
insured commercial products they will
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
now have the same level of protections
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
from balance billing as is provided
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
under federal law for self-funded plans
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
so we're matching our state level
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
protections with the federal
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
protections representative
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
spear this is a a simple clarification
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
question question on page two uh around
 
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.750 align:start position:0%
question question on page two uh around
line

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
12 could you explain what those that
 
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
string of words mean
 
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
sure page two line 12 you said page two
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
line 12 representative yeah yeah there's
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
a string of words there I I can't figure
 
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
out what they're saying you want to read
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
the words just so we know I can try yeah
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph one shall not apply with
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
respect to items or Services other than
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
items or services that qualify as
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
ancillaries Services Under 42 USC
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
section 30 3 300 gg- 132 B2 and three
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
furnished by a non-participating
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
provider to a covered person if the
 
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
provider satisfies the notice and can
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
send criteria under oh you can read the
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
rest of it okay
 
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
um that for us please we don't need to
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
apologize for the obscurity of this
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
language because it's word for word from
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
the federal statute so they're the on
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
who are obscure but basically um what it
 
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.070 align:start position:0%
who are obscure but basically um what it
allows

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
allows
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
for um in certain situations the
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
patients can wave uh the right to be
 
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:12.919 align:start position:0%
protected from balanced billing if
 
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:15.640 align:start position:0%
they're in network and they are notified
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
of their rights and they want to go
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
ahead and get services from this autof
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
network provider they can wave it under
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
certain yes yes you have to forgive me I
 
00:23:30.029 --> 00:23:30.039 align:start position:0%
never would have guessed that okay
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
so I have a question um this parallel
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process how do the
 
00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
parties decide whether to use the state
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
or federal uh process when is it decided
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
how is it decided um the way we um got
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
it to work is that basically we treat
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
only the health care providers as the
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
grieved party so it's the provider who
 
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
gets to decide whether to go with the
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
state process or the federal process for
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
so there's this 20-day time limit if the
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
provider wants to go with the state
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
process you have to act within that 20
 
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
days and if you want the federal process
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
um you can go beyond the 20 days to the
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
30-day Federal deadline and and then
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that uh in your
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
current budget you can manage this
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
parallel process standing it up and yes
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
we are very confident that we can do
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to require any
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
additional staff because as I said we'll
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
just contract with the third party rdrs
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
we'll send that out to them it'll come
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
back in it should not take any more
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
effort or work than it does for our
 
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
current external review process which
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
we've got bandwidth and capacity to
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
handle all right great any further
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing none thank
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you all and
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
I have one more card here for 173 and
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
Alexandra I can't I can't read your last
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
name I'm sorry you can just tell us
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
begins with an s from the uh New
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Justice good
 
00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
morning Alexander snowski for the
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice members of the
 
00:25:04.389 --> 00:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
committee um so I am an Assistant
 
00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
Attorney General with the consumer
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
protection and Anti-Trust Bureau and I'm
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
here to speak solely on the portion that
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
adds the balance billing provision to
 
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act under
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
358a um so I want I just want to mention
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
we've spoken to the insurance department
 
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
on this part of it um but under RSA 358
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
A3 there's an exemption for trade or
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
Commerce that is regulated and subject
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
to the jurisdiction of the insurance
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
commission and they believe that this
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
the portion that we are regulating is
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
not subject to their jurisdiction where
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
we would be regulating is the final bill
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
from the provider to the consumer
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
directly so all the Upstream stuff is
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
with the insurance department and we
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
would be regulating the bill the
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited balance bill from the
 
00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:02.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
consumer another thing we always talk
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
about our resources so they the
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
insurance department stated to us that
 
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
they haven't received a lot of
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
complaints on this issue um we believe
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
there would there will be some but we
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't think this will be um a strain on
 
00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
our resources but we welcome the
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come back in case that it
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
turns out to be happy to take any
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you for your

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for pelvic floor
 
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
therapy and uh would you introduce
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
yourself for the record state
 
00:30:19.509 --> 00:30:19.519 align:start position:0%
representative Brian Cole
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester Senate Bill
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
176 relative to insurance coverage for
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
pelvic floor
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
therapy this bill directs insurance
 
00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner to provide guidance and
 
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
report on insurance coverage for pelvic
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
floor therapy and I think we're all
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
interested to find out what exactly that
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
is all right thank you and uh we'll call
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
Hardy croll from a
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
ahip uh to tell us a little more about
 
00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.029 align:start position:0%
ahip uh to tell us a little more about
this

00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill um good morning uh Mr chairman and
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh for the
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
record my name is Heidi croll I work at
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
Gallagher cahan and gartell and I
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
represent ahip which is America's health
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
insurance plans I wasn't necessarily
 
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
planning on speaking on on this one I
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
signed up neutral um but thought it
 
00:31:16.269 --> 00:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to um say a few words
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
since no one else was here to speak on
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
the bill um so this issue came up so
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that was carried over
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
from last
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
year and um I think the concern that was
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
was brought
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
by um at least one provider group um uh
 
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
was concerned that carriers weren't
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
covering this um carriers are covering
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
um pelvic Flo therapy when it is
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
medically deemed medically necessary um
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
and so I think it was determined um when
 
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
this bill was in the um Senate that
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps just some um uh additional
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
guidance from the Department um which is
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
the first um
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
uh part of the bill um written guidance
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
typically would come from the Department
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
in the form of a bulletin um and then
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
potentially some education around this
 
00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
um for the providers um might be
 
00:32:16.029 --> 00:32:16.039 align:start position:0%
valuable um and then the commissioner
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
agreed simply to look at um as it says
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
the current scope and adequacy of Health
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
Care coverage for pelvic floor therapy
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
and if there are any gaps um that they
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
would um be able to bring that to the
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
attention of the legislature so um it's
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty straightforward um and
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
i''d be happy to try to answer any
 
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
questions could you just explain to us
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
what pelvic floor therapy is so we have
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
a baseline sure um so I think the issue
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
um comes up typically um around
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
childbirth um and rather and you know I
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
guess if the public floor muscles have
 
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
become um damaged or stretched as part
 
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
of the pregnancy process or birthing
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
process all right thank you
 
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.470 align:start position:0%
process all right thank you
representative

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
spear based on the wording of this bill
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
should it actually be a bill or should
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
it have been a request of the uh
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
insurance department it doesn't seem
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
like it's the wording of it seems like
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
it should be a bill at all it's just a
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
report yeah certain certainly I I don't
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
want to speak for the department but um
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
they're always very willing to be
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
helpful and so to your point I think
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
probably that could have been an
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
alternative path um simply to ask them
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
to to take care of a couple of tasks
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
so e we can't claim credit as
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
politicians if we don't make it a bill
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
right all right uh any other
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
questions questions representative just
 
00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:47.559 align:start position:0%
a quick question who typically um does
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
this therapy like I mean is it as nurse
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
practitioner yeah I I think it's
 
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
generally um physical therapist although
 
00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
I um I think that there may be people
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
who specialize in this type of therapy
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
as well or it may be a type of therapy
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's um delivered in the context of
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
maybe other kind of um pregnancy and
 
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
birthing um services that may be
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
provided um and so again I think that
 
00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:16.839 align:start position:0%
might be back to the point around um
 
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
just the education for providers around
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
this um so Y and you had said earlier
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
that this is already covered generally
 
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:28.839 align:start position:0%
by the so if this is so if it's deemed
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
to be a medically necessary if there's
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
some sort of diagnosis um and it's this
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
therapy is deemed to be medically
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
necessary and appropriate that it would
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
um you know help kind of heal or or uh
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
you know be an appropriate treatment um
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
then carriers are covering it um it's
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
not going to be covered if it's a um if
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
there is no diagnosis and it's just
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
being done as kind of a prophylactic um
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
therapy then that would be the
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the patient um that
 
00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
they might be able to do this you know
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
as part of their exercise routine all
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative P thank
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
you um this might be very granular but
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
so will the
 
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
report review what is medically
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
necessary is that the parameters of this
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
report so that we don't get into the you
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
know kind of the Weeds on what may be
 
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
beneficial but not medically necessary
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
so we do have a atory definition of
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
medical necessity um already on in in
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
the laws in New Hampshire so um the
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
report or the guidance could certainly
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
reference reference those guid that the
 
00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:43.599 align:start position:0%
guidance around what what is medically
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
necessary um right and just to to clear
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know to determine um so again the
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
for example the department again I don't
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
want to speak for them because I don't
 
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
know exactly how they would do an
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
approach but they might look at their um
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
they have a claim stated datase where
 
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
they collect claims from all of the
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
payers so they might look there to see
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
um uh what what that shows for coverage
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
what that might show for denials there's
 
00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
an um that includes when there's a
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
denial it will give a reason there's an
 
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
you know um information about the reason
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
for denial so um they might take a look
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
at you know that sort of data so but yes
 
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
I think to answer your point I think
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
that they to answer your question I
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
think that they would um reference
 
00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:29.309 align:start position:0%
think that they would um reference
medical

00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
necessity all right uh seeing no further
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for Testimony sir
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
and we have uh one more card and this is
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
department good morning Jason Dexter New
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department assistant
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner just wanted to speak
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
quickly to one of the questions that
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
came up
 
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
um we agree it reads more like a request
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh we did do a a report in March that we
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
provided uh that details a lot of these
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
issues we can provide that report to
 
00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
this committee as well um you know our
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
general responses we think that there is
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
um this coverage is available sometimes
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
there's network issues certain providers
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
that are out in the market aren't in
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
network and that tends to be um
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
an issue but other than that we'll be
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
happy to forward the
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
report could you send that to us in time
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
for the subcomittee hearing subcommittee
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh work session you can go today okay
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
perfect representative Suk thank you for
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh coming to visit us sure and uh you're
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
you're basically you're saying that this
 
00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
bill has already been
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
answered if I understand it correctly
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
well I see the sponsor here she may not
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
maybe able to give some insight to that
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
but we tried to respond to it
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
immediately because we felt it was
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
something we could do in house there are
 
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
times when we have requests that we need
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
to send um outside the department this
 
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
one we felt to have the information to
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
do it so we just felt we provide it
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome all right I see
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
no further
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you for your
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you and then the last
 
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
so we had a question earlier uh is
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
legislation for this necessary maybe you
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
can answer that question thank you yes
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
sure hi committee for the record I'm
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
Senator Rebecca Perkins quoka and my
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
grave apologies for being late I'm in um
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
committee downstairs and we just we're
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
in a line of questioning um so I hear
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
your question about whether the
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislation is necessary I'm happy to
 
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:53.079 align:start position:0%
talk with the Department further about
 
00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
that but as amended by the Senate this
 
00:38:56.319 --> 00:38:58.150 align:start position:0%
that but as amended by the Senate this
bill

00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
um asks for
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
clarity about coverage for our providers
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
so what we're finding is that the
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
experience of our providers in the field
 
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
is that there's a little bit of
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
uncertainty around reimbursement and so
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
um even though the carriers are saying
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
um pelvic floor therapy is covered and
 
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
the department has done this wonderful
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
report which I very much appreciate I
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
think it continues to highlight that um
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
there's still some
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
ambiguity about under what codes um
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
treatment can be submitted to guarantee
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and so it becomes a small
 
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
business issue because our providers
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
can't open up a practice because they're
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
not certain of their revenue stream and
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
so we want to guarantee our patients
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
have access and we want to create
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
Clarity for those providers in terms of
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
planning their business you know if they
 
00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:52.359 align:start position:0%
need to grow or take certain number of
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
appointments making sure they know which
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
codes are going to work to get money in
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
the door to cover those obligations and
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
so it's been great to work with the
 
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
Department um if this is something
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
they're willing to do without
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that's fine too but I do
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
think some sort of written clarification
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
is needed and um and this bill has been
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
impress for a long time I actually was
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
reflecting this morning I introduced it
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
on February 1st of 2023 in the Senate um
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
you know it was re-referred to interim
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
study it was studied this fall this was
 
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:26.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment that was agreed to it was
 
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
adopted in January AR and I've since had
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
a whole another baby and created another
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
human in this world so um you know I
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
think it would be important to to just
 
00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
sort of see this work through and just
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that those small business
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
owners and those providers have the
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
clarity they
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
need just a a question for you um the
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is fairly generic
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like since uh this was
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
filed we have a report that may be
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
mostly complete yes but there may be
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
gaps in the report and your vision for
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill is supposed to accomplish
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
could you give us we have a subcommittee
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
work session uh on this bill in a week
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
or two could you give us some analysis
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
on any deficiencies in the in the report
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
that the department generated and that
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
maybe that would be an amendment for
 
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
this bill to sort of clarify what gaps
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh specific gaps need to be addressed
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's a great suggestion Vice chair and
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
I appre appreciate the opportunity yes I
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
will certainly do that great cool any
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%

01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
177 this is a bill that was actually
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
retained in the Senate so that we could
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
do some more work on it before it came
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
to the house and I'll explain a little
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
bit about its progress as we go but what
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
we're working on here and this is titled
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
so no so New Hampshire kids can move is
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that will require that our
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
private payers cover at one activity
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
specific prosthetic okay for a child 18
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
years of age okay or younger and when we
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
first started out we were talking about
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
Orthotics and Prosthetics but in the
 
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
course of doing an insurance mandate
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
review the recommendations came back and
 
01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:52.839 align:start position:0%
said that focusing on the prosthetic was
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
where most of the support and the data
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
was was moved in was focused in that
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
direction so let me just tell you a
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
little bit about um why we're here and
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
why this is so important to me and my um
 
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
in my full-time world I mean I'm a
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
paramedic but I'm also the executive
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
director of a group called The American
 
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
trauma Society we support Trauma Centers
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
and the trauma survivors Network
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
throughout the country and I have had
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
the honor of working with members of the
 
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
limb loss community and this community
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
had came to me come come to me
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
originally through trauma but the truth
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
is not just traumatic events that lead
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
to limb loss it's also cancer and it
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
also you could be born have a congenital
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
defect what we're trying to do here is
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
bring basically make it equal for the
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
children in the limb loss Community to
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
play and play on the you know be on the
 
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
playground play sports lead an active
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
lifestyle just like any other child um
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
our concern or my concern when taking
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
this on initially besides the fact fact
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
that they just didn't have access um and
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
had to pay for this was that you know
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
these kids they should be able to play
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
sports just like anybody else they
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
should be in the playground I remember
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
how we had what we have we play
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
dodgeball I don't know if they allow you
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
to do that anymore dodgeball kickball
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be but it Al is also
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
and it's spoken to in the insurance
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
mandate review this promotes a healthy
 
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
lifestyle because so we are doing two
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
things here you know bringing
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
inclusiveness and act you know being
 
01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
bringing these children into a place
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
where they are comfortably and healthy
 
01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
comfortably and in a health status part
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
of their community so that is the focus
 
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
of this other states have been working
 
01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
on this legislation and Maggie bomber is
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
here from the hangar Clinic that will
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
talk about some of the other states that
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
have adopted um this but here's one of
 
01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
the things that I know and Maggie will
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
talk to this is that under the
 
01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:51.799 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act the essential health
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
benefits specifically rehabilitative
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
services and device
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
are covered therefore these devices
 
01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
should be covered so what happens is
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
under these benefits there's a limb of
 
01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
what they call like daily living just
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that would be you know for maybe
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
maybe when you go to school maybe when
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
you're you go to um you know a holiday
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the the day-to-day activity is
 
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
um but there's
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
also the requirement for a second device
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
and that could be an activity specific
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
specific we are not asking for multiple
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
specific devices we're asking under this
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill as amended for an activity one
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
activity specific device with all the
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
pieces and parts that go with it um and
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
also that this is deemed as medically
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
necessary that language was brought in
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
here as well so that is um that's what I
 
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
have to say today and I'm hoping that
 
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
you know I'll wrap up by saying New
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children and their family
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to apply for Grants or
 
01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
hold bake sales to afford an activity
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
specific device so they can live their
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
best and active life um I look forward
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
to your support I think this is one of
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
there's not
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
a the numbers are low in how many we may
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
need to provide but what is really high
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
and of the greatest importance is this
 
01:05:16.109 --> 01:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
quality of life and ability to be part
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
of their school their Sports whatever
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
they might want to do so thank you for
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony I will try to answer
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
questions you might have some of the
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
very technical work will come um with
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%

you represent burs thank you senator for
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question am I I mean kids kids
 
01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
do multiple Sports in a year I mean they
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
may do winter activities things sports
 
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760 align:start position:0%
that are in different kinds of we
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
weather so why are we limiting it to one
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
activity the prothetic for one activity
 
01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
per year thank you for the question
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative Barrow so this
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
is it's a great question but as you know
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
being a legislator there are compromises
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
that you have to come to and if the
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
compromise is not having this covered
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
versus having one covered then I you
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
know then I'm advocating for let's have
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
one covered thank you I just would
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
Advocate we go the next step next time
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
around and get another one thank you
 
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.269 align:start position:0%
around and get another one thank you

representative
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
patril yes thank you I was going to ask
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
if and perhaps someone else has the
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
answer um the number of kids that might
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
be affected by this and if one device
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
would cover most of the activities
 
01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
believe in it's per year correct because
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
kids grow so it would it's one device
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
per year it's as they need so it can be
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's aligned with grow with growth but
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
at at a Max yes at a Max of one special
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
they might not need more it's going to
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
depend on their growth right so it's one
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
per year correct okay depending on their
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
growth the numbers of kids and if less
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
than 10 is what the insurance mandate
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
review has listed in it yes and um oh
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
sorry what uh segments of the insured
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
with this uh be so it's state local
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
private private the private payers the
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
state is exempt from this it doesn't um
 
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
cover self-funded plans under dur Orissa
 
01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
so it's only a very small of the insured
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
population correct so what happens to
 
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
the state and the
 
01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
other um well we'd certainly be happy to
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
take that up next so incrementally um
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
this has been the movement and if we can
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
make if we can make steps into that
 
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
Community pardon the pun but make the
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
steps into those communities we
 
01:07:40.349 --> 01:07:40.359 align:start position:0%
certainly would be happy to or I'd
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
certainly be happy to all representative
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
Solan thank you Senator um so you just
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned or I got caught up in when you
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
said this is medically necessary so um
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
does that mean like somebody will say
 
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
this is medic necessary for these second
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
second activity based Sports based
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it um
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
prosthetic that would be deemed medical
 
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
medically necessary in in this statute
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
is that how that would work thank you
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan I'll put there's
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
a bright light behind you I don't know
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
if it's a it's okay it's like it's just
 
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
the sun shining so we must get used to
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
that U so that's why I'm scrin a little
 
01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:19.590 align:start position:0%
that U so that's why I'm scrin a little
uh

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
so one act so one limb of daily living
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
mhm one activity
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
specific and the it would need to be
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
deemed you know a physician or care
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
provider would need to say that this was
 
01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
medically necessary okay like that
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
they've qualified and it was necessary
 
01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:38.669 align:start position:0%
they've qualified and it was necessary
for

01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
them okay so um to be clear I'm very
 
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:44.199 align:start position:0%
supportive of this I'm just a little
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
concerned could that potentially open
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
like a loophole for them to say well
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
clearly it's not medically necessary
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
because these people can survive without
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
this I'm just worried that it could open
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
up some sort of loophole so maybe you've
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
thought about that I have thought about
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
that so it's not it links into the
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
statute there is a um there's like I
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
don't I think dispute resolution it
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
might so if you medically necessary it
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
gets denied then there's the next level
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
that you can take it to so there's an
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity um the intent here is not to
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
open a loophole and close it and thank
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
you for identifying that but uh we have
 
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
at least two guards at the door to try
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that these children can get
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
these activity specific limbs when it's
 
01:09:27.070 --> 01:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
when it's deemed when it's necessary
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
questions okay one quick one quick one
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry this might be again in the
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
weeds but are these currently covered or
 
01:09:41.070 --> 01:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the insurance
 
01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
company they're they're not covered at
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
all not at
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%

okay thank you for allowing us to speak
 
01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
today um my name is Samantha Collier
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
from Marram New Hampshire this is my son
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
Aiden uh he is an 11-year-old cancer
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
survivor who lost his leg in exchange
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
for better odds of survivorship we are
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
here today in support of SB 177 Aden was
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with rabdo myos saroma at the
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
end of March 2021 and became an amputee
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning of June 2021
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
before getting sick Aiden was a very
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
active child and even then chemo
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't keep him down he was fitted for
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
his first prosthetic in August 2021 and
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
walked independently just a few weeks
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
later it wasn't long before Aiden was
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
ready to return to the sports and
 
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
activities with friends he sorely missed
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
we then found out that running blades
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
were not covered by insurance and our
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
put weight back on this caused his
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
socket to no longer fit and he returned
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
to walk working with his walking leg
 
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
this leg is not only bulkier with the
 
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
knee but heavier and he had to adjust
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
his gate to run and keep up with his
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
friends we again turned to borne to run
 
01:12:12.189 --> 01:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
and got in line for financing for a new
 
01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
blade because we didn't have the money
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
to replace it it took several months
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
until Aiden's turn for funding again
 
01:12:20.550 --> 01:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
which we were grateful for that they
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
could cover he received his new socket
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
in March 2024 and began working right
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
away to regain the skills he lost in the
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
months being without his blade a weight
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
and loss that wouldn't have happened had
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
our insurance been required to cover his
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
prosthetic wasting valuable time and
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
skills that he had learned such as
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
proper pressure to his blade how to use
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
the spring of the carbon fiber for more
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
power and keeping his body properly
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
aligned this resulted in a lot of
 
01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
frustration on Aiden's part because it
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
felt like he had been set back today
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
Aiden is getting ready to run the bionic
 
01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
5K in Cambridge on April 28th and we
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
feel so fortunate that we were able to
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
find someone to finance his blade
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
because Insurance didn't find an
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
accessible and active lifestyle to be
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
medically necessary we along with many
 
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
parents of children with limb difference
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
feel the frustration that our children
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
aren't given access to the Prosthetics
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
to continue to do and try activities
 
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
they love to lead full and happy lives
 
01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
especially in their
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
childhood we feel the worry of trying to
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
figure out how to fund the next socket
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
when our children out grow their current
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
ones because we know that while
 
01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
foundations exist the funds may not
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
always be available we encourage
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
everyone before us with all their limbs
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
to think how fortunate they are to be
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
able to participate in activities they
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
enjoy and to vote in favor of kids who
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
need something extra to participate in
 
01:13:45.149 --> 01:13:45.159 align:start position:0%
their favorite
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
activities all right thank you and Aiden
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
would you like to tell us what's on your
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
just tell us tell us what you're
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
thinking it's

01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
of I do you want me to say it for
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
you it's okay
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
buddy what grade are you
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
in sixth grade great you do Sports yeah

what kind of sports do you I do soccer I
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
really like
 
01:14:31.229 --> 01:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
soccer and you GNA be running
 
01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
soon yeah I run a
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot why do you need to run you said you
 
01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:42.400 align:start position:0%
you always have to be ready to run I
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
because you just never know when you
 
01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
run you you you never really know when
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
run soccer
 
01:14:58.990 --> 01:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
and you like to play midfield right yeah
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
up and down I don't like
 
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
defense represent pus you have a
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
question hi yes Aiden you play soccer in
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
the fall correct yes and in the spring
 
01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:13.719 align:start position:0%
okay are you going to be uh doing any
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
spring Sports which require running
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
also yes
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
soccer oh okay he plays it both in both
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
fall and spring okay I thought you'd go
 
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
after for something really crazy like
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
lacrosse like I used to
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
do any other questions represent Cole
 
01:15:33.390 --> 01:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
question thanks for being here today so
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
you've had the prosthetic for about
 
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
three years now uh yeah how many how
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
many occasions have Arisen where you
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
needed to replace it in that threeyear
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
span two yeah yeah like two because I
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
okay can you give us an idea what the
 
01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
cost is for the
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
prospe or his mother one the two 20,000
 
01:16:08.270 --> 01:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
it was $20,000 yeah around like
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
$20,000 20 grand I think okay thank
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
you represent Bros um this we do
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
something called would you believe and
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say would you believe you
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
said sometimes you need to run we feel
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
that way a lot in this committee we feel
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
like we need to run out of here but the
 
01:16:26.189 --> 01:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
other thing I wanted to say to you
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
there's a movie I don't know if you've
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
seen Jerry Maguire uh with Tom Cruz and
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh the character says to to Tom Cruz you
 
01:16:37.149 --> 01:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
Aiden all right any other questions
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
repres so uh is he is the one
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate or would he need different
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
ones for different
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
activities do you want me to answer that
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
one uh
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yes uh so for right now his running
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
blade is kind of his go-to um there are
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
different things like you know if he
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
decides in the future to pursue say
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
swimming or something more water-based
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
he would we would look more for a
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
water-based um prosthesis but as of
 
01:17:14.669 --> 01:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
right now he is both feet on well foot
 
01:17:17.470 --> 01:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
on the ground and a and a hook there and
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
he's he's really happy with you know
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
working with his running blade he
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
actually wears it every day instead of
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
his walking leg because it's just easier
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
for him as a child to just take off and
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
go and did he a real quick follow up so
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
has he outgrown them or did he wear them
 
01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
out for the replacement he uh both he
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually um said he actually cracked the
 
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
one running blade for because of
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
excessive use um which was covered under
 
01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
warranty and then he did outgrow his
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
socket the one so he outgrew one and yes
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
outus the other okay thank you
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
yes all right any further questions from
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
the committee all right seeing none
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you both for your
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
job so uh we have another in support uh
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
Step hi everyone my name is Kate Martin
 
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm a certified prosthetist
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
orthotist at nextstep bionics and
 
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:31.400 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics in Manchester New
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I grew up in westerland
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
attended Keen high and I'm a Plymouth
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
State graduate it's safe to say I love
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
this state I appreciate the opportunity
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
to speak today in support of s SP
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
177 as a clinician I've seen the
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
significant impact recreational proses
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
can have on a patient's physical and
 
01:18:52.830 --> 01:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
mental health unfortunately recreational
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
prostheses can be rather costly ranging
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
from 5,000 to upwards of
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
$50,000 for children this cost can
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
increase rapidly as frequent replacement
 
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
is necessary due to
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
growth I think we can all agree you
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
would never use your rake to shovel snow
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
or wear dress shoes to run a 5k instead
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
you would likely use a specific tool or
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
choose gear that is most appropriate
 
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
allowing you to perform at your best
 
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
deeming a recreational prosthesis not
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
medically necessary is denying a child
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
access to tools that will allow them to
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
per perform at their best and just be a
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
kid this is particularly problematic as
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities are 4.5 times
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
less likely to engage in physical
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
activity compared to their peers
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
furthermore the prevalence of obesity in
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities is almost
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
twice that of children without
 
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities although a child's everyday
 
01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
prosthesis may allow them to chase their
 
01:19:48.189 --> 01:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
sibling around the house it likely
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
cannot withstand going in the ocean or
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
keeping up with teammates at a baseball
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
practice sp17 7 will address this issue
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
by requiring State Commercial insurers
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
to cover activity specific prcs for
 
01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
enroles 19 years and under SB 177 will
 
01:20:06.669 --> 01:20:06.679 align:start position:0%
provide children with limb loss and limb
 
01:20:08.669 --> 01:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
difference access to prosthetic care
 
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
they need to live active full
 
01:20:13.709 --> 01:20:13.719 align:start position:0%
lives with the increase in mental and
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
physical health issues including
 
01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:17.639 align:start position:0%
depression and obesity I believe that
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
this investment would actually lower
 
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
future health care costs Next Step
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
includes three of the 11 OMP facilities
 
01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire within these three
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
clinics children under the age of 18
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
make up only 7% of the prosthetic
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
patients we see if passed the cost to
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance companies would be
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
nominal however the impact would be
 
01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
substantial the children of the Granite
 
01:20:42.189 --> 01:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
State deserve better and that is why I
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
urge you to support this important
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
legislation and help its passage into
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
law I would like to personally invite
 
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:49.719 align:start position:0%
you to visit our facility in Manchester
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
to meet with myself children and
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
families who would benefit from this
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill to provide you with a greater
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
understanding of the challenges that
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
these individuals face and how SB 177
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
can change their lives and Future Health
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you for Testimony uh
 
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:10.550 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you for Testimony uh
representative

01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.669 --> 01:21:14.679 align:start position:0%
post I'm on okay sorry um so a question
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
is as kids grow and it their leg doesn't
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
fit into it or arm or whatever they have
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
um is there not a way to improve upon
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
like it kind of change it up like with
 
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
where it would
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
fit is there to to reduce the cost for
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
that or does it have to be one
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
continuous could it be interchangeable I
 
01:21:45.149 --> 01:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
guess yeah they it would sort of depend
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
on what the issue is but certainly if
 
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
volume is an issue um there's many
 
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
different adjustments we can do we can
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
thin out the socket we can open up the
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
back um we could even change liners to a
 
01:21:57.790 --> 01:21:57.800 align:start position:0%
thinner liner or something like that if
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
needed um those are things that we
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
choose to do sort of already too just to
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of appointments
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
patients have we know that's not really
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
practical if they have to keep coming
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
back um I know that the feet usually
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
have about a three-year warranty so as
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
long as a foot isn't no longer
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate due to size if it were to
 
01:22:17.629 --> 01:22:17.639 align:start position:0%
break we can send it in and get a new
 
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
one no cost um so there's a lot of
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
different ways that we can prolong
 
01:22:24.669 --> 01:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
something as long as we can but then
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
there comes a time where it's just not
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
going to fit anywhere right well great
 
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
that representative Tusk uh thank you
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
Kate uh I have a question I don't know
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
if you can answer or not this bill is
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
for uh young people under 19 is there in
 
01:22:50.669 --> 01:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
effect any bills for people over 19 that
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
are already in
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
force so I know in the state of
 
01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um this is moving forward
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
to include adults as well um I know
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
right now this is where we stand 19
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
years in under and under but certainly
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
as a clinician I think that could be
 
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
something for the future to focus on but
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in place right now so
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
those are not covered for 19 and up
 
01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:15.070 align:start position:0%
those are not covered for 19 and up
thank

01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
questions uh do you have written
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
testimony yep that'd be great the clerk
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
I think Samantha Samantha so you also
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
have written testimony yeah if you don't
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
mind submitting it that would be great
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay so we last card okay so last card
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
barin good morning good
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
morning thank thanks everyone for having
 
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
me my name is Maggie bomber I'm actually
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
a resident of
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um and I'm here
 
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
representing Hangar Clinic which is the
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
largest provider of prosthetic and
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
orthotic Clinical Services in the
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
country um so I'm also the immediate
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
past president of the National
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
Association for the advancement of
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
Orthotics and Prosthetics which
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
represents the limb loss and limb
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
difference Community I'm also a person
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
with an upper extremity limb loss and I
 
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
wear a prosthetic arm every day uh I've
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
been lucky enough to be participating in
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
the so everybody can move initiative
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
which Senator Apprentice had mentioned
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
uh this is a movement to pass laws in
 
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
all states that ensure coverage of
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
orthoses and prostheses for physical
 
01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
activity so in response to the question
 
01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
that was just asked there are actually
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
five states that have passed these bills
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
since 2023 in chronological order we
 
01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
have Maine Arkansas Colorado New Mexico
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
and Illinois in Maine this is for
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
prosthetic only and for those under 18
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh in Arkansas it's all ages in Colorado
 
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's also all ages and in New Mexico
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
it's also all ages and Illinois as well
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
so Maine is the only state so far that
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
only passed it for those under
 
01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:12.679 align:start position:0%
18 there's also two more bills that are
 
01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
very close to passage in both Maryland
 
01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
and uh Minnesota and our goal is to
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
enable individuals with limb loss and
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
limb difference to participate in
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
exercise Recreation and physical
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
activities to remain healthy fit and
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
functional so in New Hampshire there are
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
nearly 177,000 people living with limb
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
loss and limb difference and back in
 
01:25:35.709 --> 01:25:35.719 align:start position:0%
2003 New Hampshire passed an Orthotics
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
and Prosthetics Insurance fairness
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as parity law to ensure
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
adequate coverage of daily use
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics in state regulated
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance plans um this
 
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
prevented any arbitrary Caps or
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
restrictions from coverage which we were
 
01:25:53.109 --> 01:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
seeing across the country so there were
 
01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
20 states that pass similar laws around
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
um between 2000 and
 
01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
2012 so this bill will essentially be an
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
amendment of that insurance Fair
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
fairness law to ensure that those under
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
18 have access to uh prostheses for
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
physical activity the cost of this is
 
01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
minimal as was noted previously uh we
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
have done a recent fiscal and social
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
impact report that estimates the cost in
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to be between 1 and 5
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
cents per member per month
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
we also predict millions of dollars in
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
cost savings per year based on improved
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes and the reduction of
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
costly secondary health conditions
 
01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
including heart disease diabetes and
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
obesity which collectively cost the US
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
Health Care System $626 billion per year
 
01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
uh knee and hip problems resulting from
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
a lack of appropriate prosthetic care
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
can also result in costs ranging from
 
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
80,000 to
 
01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
$150,000 over the course of a single
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
person's lifetime so I uh am lucky
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
enough to have access to coverage for a
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
prosthesis for physical activity through
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
my employer which you can see here it's
 
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
pretty different than this one right
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
does very different things I have
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
several uh attachments that help me do
 
01:27:13.149 --> 01:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
different activities so this one is
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
specifically for yoga uh then I also
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
have an attachment for weightlifting
 
01:27:20.430 --> 01:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
skiing and
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
biking so this device enables me to be
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
Physically Active through all of those
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
activities which has greatly aided me in
 
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
my personal recovery increasing my
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
confidence as well as physical and
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
emotional while beinging after
 
01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
amputation of my forearm in hand back in
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
2012 and we believe the young residents
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire also deserve the same
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
access to care for those who have limb
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
loss in limb difference uh we also want
 
01:27:48.189 --> 01:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
to thank the payers who've been a
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
pivotal part of this process uh through
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate and working with us to make
 
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
sure that we could get something that we
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
all agreed on across the table so thank
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
you very much and I'm happy to take any
 
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
grassing thank you thank you for taking
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
my question uh question I have when they
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
when they looked at Cost here and I I
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
noticed one other person that testified
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
today talked about the onset of diabetes
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
and young children who are not able to
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
be as active is there any relationship
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
or there have been any studies of of how
 
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
what costs have been avoided uh by
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
providing PR ICS to these children and
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
allowing them to run when they want when
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
they really need to run uh I'm not aware
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
of studies specifically on prostheses
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
but there's certainly a lot of
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
information from the CDC about how
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
physical activity prevents and a
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
ameliorates those conditions so we do
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
have some of that information in our
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
handout um also as far as the fiscal and
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
social impact report that we had drafted
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
it does include an analysis of you know
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
preventative measures of access to
 
01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
physical activity and how that would
 
01:28:56.040 --> 01:28:59.709 align:start position:0%
physical activity and how that would
save

01:28:59.709 --> 01:28:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:02.920 align:start position:0%

and and and you just tell help us
 
03:20:55.790 --> 03:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
understand what this make a scenario
 
03:20:58.990 --> 03:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
give us a story so so once upon a time
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh they created a program called called
 
03:21:04.269 --> 03:21:04.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and as part of Medicaid they
 
03:21:05.590 --> 03:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
there's two different types of Medicaid
 
03:21:07.630 --> 03:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
standard Medicaid and as you know the
 
03:21:10.110 --> 03:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion population so uh a
 
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
number of New Hampshire's residents who
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
go to bed at night and get bedtime
 
03:21:16.750 --> 03:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
stories as well uh are covered by medic
 
03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
or Medicaid expansion let's say that
 
03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
that person let's say John because
 
03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
John's a great name to pick for for the
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
both of us uh that that John Johnny uh
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
just got his driver's license and he's
 
03:21:30.550 --> 03:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
he's driving on the road and doing all
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
the right things according to motor
 
03:21:33.830 --> 03:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle laws and all of a sudden
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who was very Reckless slammed
 
03:21:37.950 --> 03:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
into poor Johnny not only damaging the
 
03:21:40.030 --> 03:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
car but hurting Johnny who's covered by
 
03:21:42.910 --> 03:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and there are medical expenses
 
03:21:45.110 --> 03:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
paid on behalf of Johnny by the state of
 
03:21:47.150 --> 03:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to taxpayers and
 
03:21:49.150 --> 03:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
and half of it General funds typically
 
03:21:51.150 --> 03:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
and the other half ferally funded uh
 
03:21:53.229 --> 03:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
it's actually a higher percentage uh 90
 
03:21:55.309 --> 03:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
9010 for those who are in the expansion
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
population so that's part of the story
 
03:21:58.950 --> 03:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
and then the story gets a little bit
 
03:22:02.469 --> 03:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
more complicated uh so there's a third
 
03:22:05.070 --> 03:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
party out there insurer that provides
 
03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance coverage for the wrongdoer
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
here so let's find somebody who we can
 
03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
pick for a wrongdoer so they're insur
 
03:22:12.870 --> 03:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
they're insured in this case with the
 
03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
other the mot they're they're insured
 
03:22:17.150 --> 03:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
the minimum insurance policy and we're
 
03:22:19.510 --> 03:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
gon to call him affectionately Jeb Jeb
 
03:22:21.790 --> 03:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
is a really nice man and just you just
 
03:22:24.030 --> 03:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
got to love Jeb but he was Reckless on
 
03:22:27.150 --> 03:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
the state and but but he was covered for
 
03:22:28.990 --> 03:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh for his insurance on his motor
 
03:22:31.110 --> 03:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle including for personal body
 
03:22:33.150 --> 03:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
injury to another individual that he get
 
03:22:35.910 --> 03:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
harmed right so all of a sudden you know
 
03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
everything gets going really well Johnny
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
gets the medical treatment that Johnny
 
03:22:42.670 --> 03:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh needs and and Johnny gets a full
 
03:22:45.309 --> 03:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
recovery so but then there's like a
 
03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
price tag for for that paid by the state
 
03:22:50.630 --> 03:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
in part and for that medical care and
 
03:22:52.510 --> 03:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
then that's when Tasha Tasha's a great
 
03:22:54.670 --> 03:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
story name too it sounds almost like you
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
know a you know what are those Brothers
 
03:23:00.189 --> 03:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
Grims kind of story so so so Tasha uh
 
03:23:02.349 --> 03:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
finds out that there's this insurer out
 
03:23:04.750 --> 03:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
there who is going to be responsible for
 
03:23:06.389 --> 03:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
paying back the state of New Hampshire
 
03:23:08.070 --> 03:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
for those medical assistant that be an
 
03:23:10.349 --> 03:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
auto insurance company yes it could be
 
03:23:12.990 --> 03:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
an a because there's some there's 50 you
 
03:23:16.030 --> 03:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
know let's say 5025 you had some Auto
 
03:23:17.630 --> 03:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
Insurance company had some liability
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
here yeah which which is the second
 
03:23:21.030 --> 03:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
chapter in the next book which is a
 
03:23:22.830 --> 03:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
great example of another
 
03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
scenario and so so so Tasha then sends a
 
03:23:30.590 --> 03:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
claims form to this insurer Who
 
03:23:32.030 --> 03:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
currently says well under your New
 
03:23:34.550 --> 03:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law it doesn't it says doesn't
 
03:23:36.670 --> 03:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
say anything about priorization so
 
03:23:39.309 --> 03:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
because we never got priorization uh and
 
03:23:40.469 --> 03:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
I know we're now getting to health
 
03:23:41.790 --> 03:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
insurance a little away from the car
 
03:23:43.229 --> 03:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
insurance thing but yeah yeah this is
 
03:23:44.710 --> 03:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
property casually property casually
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
don't have that waiver do they have that
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
requirement um yes nine times out of 10
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
auto insurance wouldn't have that but
 
03:23:57.229 --> 03:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
for follow-up visits and whatnot they
 
03:24:00.110 --> 03:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
may require prior Ross and so then they
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
can deny for that um but you're right
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
for an initial accident initial you know
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
ass our PNC guys were here today but
 
03:24:09.790 --> 03:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
they're not here now
 
03:24:13.110 --> 03:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
so so because because of the story
 
03:24:15.590 --> 03:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
scenario is kind of unraveling a bit
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
we'll just get right to the point of
 
03:24:18.830 --> 03:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
what the bill is trying trying to do
 
03:24:20.510 --> 03:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
which is coming in compliance with
 
03:24:23.110 --> 03:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
federal law all the state uh 4D
 
03:24:24.670 --> 03:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
directors you know Henry Litman our
 
03:24:26.429 --> 03:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director all of them received a
 
03:24:29.110 --> 03:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
letter back in April of last year that
 
03:24:31.070 --> 03:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
says your state laws have to come into
 
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
compliance for good reason for auditing
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
purposes which is tsh's background as an
 
03:24:37.990 --> 03:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
auditor that uh that claims cannot be
 
03:24:40.349 --> 03:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
denied by virtue of not having a
 
03:24:43.189 --> 03:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
priorization under the health carriers
 
03:24:45.630 --> 03:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
because Medicaid as you know doesn't
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
even involve
 
03:24:49.870 --> 03:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
if it's a Medicaid covered um benefit it
 
03:24:51.990 --> 03:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't it's already pre-authorized so
 
03:24:54.030 --> 03:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's a shield for the third party
 
03:24:56.750 --> 03:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
liability company not to pay what they
 
03:25:00.189 --> 03:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
should be paying as part of this so with
 
03:25:01.790 --> 03:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
that because I got the aha moment the
 
03:25:04.229 --> 03:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
moral to the story is always start your
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
presentation based upon a story I I love
 
03:25:08.309 --> 03:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
this approach R hunt and I think I will
 
03:25:09.790 --> 03:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
try to replicate it and I'll work harder
 
03:25:12.550 --> 03:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
on a better story next time but I'm but
 
03:25:17.630 --> 03:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:19.710 --> 03:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for theot is that
 
03:25:21.670 --> 03:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get TMS says we need to
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
be in compliance we need language that
 
03:25:27.630 --> 03:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
and and of course when CMS says jump we
 
03:25:31.150 --> 03:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
say how high and therefore we want to
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
always be in compliance so we do get our
 
03:25:36.070 --> 03:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursements we do get our coverage
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
so perfect okay now are there any
 
03:25:43.189 --> 03:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members see
 
03:25:44.349 --> 03:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
didn't need
 
03:25:47.070 --> 03:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
it thank you okay we do have a question
 
03:25:49.180 --> 03:25:49.190 align:start position:0%

03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory health insurance coverage for
 
03:42:04.710 --> 03:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
blood tests associated with elevated uh
 
03:42:07.510 --> 03:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
lead levels it was the intention of the
 
03:42:09.790 --> 03:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
legislature when mandatory coverage for
 
03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
blood tests for elevated lead levels was
 
03:42:16.830 --> 03:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
adopted to include the follow-up testing
 
03:42:20.030 --> 03:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
uh required without cost sharing however
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
um it had in some instances it hasn't
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
been um it hasn't been being done so the
 
03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is just to clarify
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
that intent um childhood lead poisoning
 
03:42:33.189 --> 03:42:33.199 align:start position:0%
is a Public Health crisis that can cause
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
development delays disabilities and
 
03:42:39.149 --> 03:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
other cognitive um adverse effects we
 
03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire has some of the
 
03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
oldest housing stock in the country and
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
over 30,000 children live in homes with
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
lead based paint so and between 2017 and
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
2021 535 children uh tested positive for
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
elevated lead paint levels and then the
 
03:42:59.790 --> 03:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
Senate did amend um Senate Bill 399 with
 
03:43:01.189 --> 03:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
an agreement reached by all the
 
03:43:03.030 --> 03:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to ensure that this was a
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
workable Bill and um the New Hampshire
 
03:43:09.910 --> 03:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
Department um insurance department has
 
03:43:13.189 --> 03:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
recently revised uh guidance on coverage
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
for blood blood Le test testing um and S
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
SP 399 aims to align the statute with
 
03:43:23.790 --> 03:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
the the practice that the insurance
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
company has or the insurance department
 
03:43:29.070 --> 03:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
has put forth um with that I will
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
questions yes re M thank you Mr chairman
 
03:43:38.710 --> 03:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I just
 
03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
read through the bill um obviously if
 
03:43:45.149 --> 03:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
somebody if their blood detects lead you
 
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
obviously do additional testing but if
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take it doesn't detect blood
 
03:43:52.030 --> 03:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here it seems to
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
limit how many times I you can go is
 
03:43:56.910 --> 03:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
there some way to limit that well what I
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
did I just talked to the uh a couple of
 
03:44:02.110 --> 03:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
the insurance uh reps here what this
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
followup is it's not a continuous um
 
03:44:07.469 --> 03:44:07.479 align:start position:0%
testing but what happens is when you
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
have let's say a one-year-old who gets
 
03:44:13.070 --> 03:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
tested and the the most uh the best way
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
to do it is obviously a pin prick in the
 
03:44:18.309 --> 03:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
finger um sometimes that will come back
 
03:44:21.189 --> 03:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
as a pulse POS false negative false
 
03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
negative or false positive so what
 
03:44:26.389 --> 03:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
they'll do with the followup is doing it
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
in a in a vein in the arm that was my
 
03:44:30.830 --> 03:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
understanding from the insurance
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
department and most of the companies are
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
doing it but there are a few um that did
 
03:44:38.429 --> 03:44:38.439 align:start position:0%
not realize that New Hampshire the all
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is considered um a lead
 
03:44:46.349 --> 03:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
um because we have such old housing it's
 
03:44:52.269 --> 03:44:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:56.269 --> 03:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
area anybody else yes represent presel
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question this
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
is not limited to Children
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
correct not no not that I no okay so and
 
03:45:09.750 --> 03:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
the followup is to have an additional
 
03:45:12.070 --> 03:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
test that would be conclusive is that
 
03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose if if uh one was nonon
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
inclusive yes and the insurance company
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance department is here to
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
answer any kind of insurance questions
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:30.790 --> 03:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
y thank you very much thank you cherro

03:45:32.720 --> 03:45:45.910 align:start position:0%
callon Alex fille from the insurance
department

03:45:45.910 --> 03:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
now you got it okay there we go um this
 
03:45:49.399 --> 03:45:51.349 align:start position:0%
now you got it okay there we go um this
bill

03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:45:55.429 --> 03:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
um uh was brought to clarify an existing
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
mandate for coverage for blood Le lead
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
testing for one and two year olds um and
 
03:46:08.550 --> 03:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
there uh the primary purpose um of the
 
03:46:11.950 --> 03:46:11.960 align:start position:0%
clarification is to clarify two things
 
03:46:14.590 --> 03:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
one that no cost sharing uh can be
 
03:46:16.429 --> 03:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
imposed osed with respect to this Blood
 
03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
Le testing because it's a preventive
 
03:46:21.670 --> 03:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
service and number two that if the
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
initial screen determines an elevated
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
level of blood lead then um the Mandate
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
extends to the follow up screening
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
service um and when this bill was first
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
introduced the insurance department um
 
03:46:41.309 --> 03:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
got in contact with CMS because we
 
03:46:44.229 --> 03:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
suspected that the Affordable Care Act
 
03:46:45.469 --> 03:46:45.479 align:start position:0%
already does
 
03:46:48.309 --> 03:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
requir this same thing and we got
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
confirmation that no cost sharing uh is
 
03:46:54.349 --> 03:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
permitted for this screening service
 
03:46:56.590 --> 03:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
because it's considered preventive and
 
03:46:59.349 --> 03:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
that the what is preventive includes the
 
03:47:01.590 --> 03:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up screening if the initial
 
03:47:06.790 --> 03:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
screening um uh shows an elevated level
 
03:47:09.550 --> 03:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
of lead so we put out a bulletin to
 
03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
clarify that that's what's required
 
03:47:13.710 --> 03:47:13.720 align:start position:0%
under the portable Care Act and we also
 
03:47:16.229 --> 03:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
helped draft an amendment to this bill
 
03:47:19.309 --> 03:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
that lines it up with the
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:28.030 --> 03:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative um if you
 
03:47:30.429 --> 03:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
if you go through the the uh tests and
 
03:47:33.389 --> 03:47:33.399 align:start position:0%
it determines that the person has a
 
03:47:35.670 --> 03:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
elevated uh lead
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
poisoning uh is there does who's going
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
to pay for any kind of treatment is it
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh is it cover treatment for this or
 
03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
anything like that yeah it's very likely
 
03:47:51.510 --> 03:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the followup care will be cover
 
03:47:54.750 --> 03:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
treatment absolutely um the main
 
03:47:58.030 --> 03:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
question is um what get what is exempt
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
from cost sharing and what's not exempt
 
03:48:02.790 --> 03:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
and so this bill makes it clear that
 
03:48:05.070 --> 03:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
that initial screening is considered
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
preventive um and therefore no cost
 
03:48:10.269 --> 03:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
sharing can can go with
 
03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:17.950 --> 03:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
representative prelli so please clarify
 
03:48:20.149 --> 03:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
again it you mentioned the one and two
 
03:48:22.830 --> 03:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
year olds is that what this bill is for
 
03:48:24.590 --> 03:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
or yeah it deals with the Mandate that
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
specifically applies to um one and two
 
03:48:29.550 --> 03:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
year olds and it's consistent with the
 
03:48:31.550 --> 03:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics
 
03:48:34.030 --> 03:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines that children be tested at
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
age one and Age Two And this is per the
 
03:48:40.269 --> 03:48:40.279 align:start position:0%
ACA um it's cons absolutely consistent
 
03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
with the ACA and you know clarifies what
 
03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
the obligation is one followup question
 
03:48:50.830 --> 03:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
so the insur you issued a bulletin yes
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that we still need
 
03:48:57.189 --> 03:48:57.199 align:start position:0%
this or it I'm not sure what um statutes
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
are better than
 
03:49:02.349 --> 03:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
bulletins they're um shocked shocked to
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
hear you say that a bulletin is simply
 
03:49:06.870 --> 03:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
the insurance Department's uh
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
announcement to the regulated entities
 
03:49:10.510 --> 03:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
of how the insurance department intends
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
to enforce a law in this case the
 
03:49:17.149 --> 03:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
portable Care Act an a statute is just a
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
direct statement of what the law we
 
03:49:22.550 --> 03:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
don't really know who is not covering it
 
03:49:26.269 --> 03:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
or um in my conversations early on with
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
The Advocates behind this bill um I
 
03:49:31.389 --> 03:49:31.399 align:start position:0%
understand that there were some
 
03:49:34.389 --> 03:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
complaints that uh came families that
 
03:49:36.469 --> 03:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
came to the advocacy organization about
 
03:49:38.429 --> 03:49:38.439 align:start position:0%
have having that cost sharing that they
 
03:49:38.439 --> 03:49:39.590 align:start position:0%
have having that cost sharing that they
didn't

03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
03:49:43.149 --> 03:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
expect and just one uh question mire
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
thank you what is the um
 
03:49:48.590 --> 03:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
Ure its Market that this covers is it
 
03:49:51.110 --> 03:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
like again yeah that's always a really
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
good question it's the regulated market
 
03:49:56.950 --> 03:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
the fully um insured Market that state
 
03:49:59.469 --> 03:49:59.479 align:start position:0%
law has jurisdiction over and it does
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
not include um self-funded plans that
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
large employers typically sponsor thank
 
03:50:07.990 --> 03:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
you this is sort of deja vu because we
 
03:50:13.269 --> 03:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
had a house bill uh when it came to
 
03:50:16.510 --> 03:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
mammographies which is mandated ACA that
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
they would be not charged for and then
 
03:50:21.550 --> 03:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
there was a need for a follow-up test
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes and we had the Mandate that we were
 
03:50:26.990 --> 03:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
going to cover that um without co-
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
Insurance Cod deductible yes very
 
03:50:32.309 --> 03:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
similar issue this is deja vu yes all
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
over all over
 
03:50:37.229 --> 03:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
again similar subject but again it goes
 
03:50:39.149 --> 03:50:39.159 align:start position:0%
back to that we do have some things that
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
are mandated that there are no
 
03:50:43.950 --> 03:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
deductibles no copays because and
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
colonoscopy is the other one all right
 
03:50:48.149 --> 03:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
any other questions to the committee
 
03:50:50.030 --> 03:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you very much
 
03:50:50.040 --> 03:50:51.790 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you very much
thank

03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:51:02.670 --> 03:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
Ellis good afternoon members of the
 
03:51:06.910 --> 03:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Molly Ellis I'm
 
03:51:09.630 --> 03:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
a resident of Kean New Hampshire um
 
03:51:11.070 --> 03:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
03:51:13.710 --> 03:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
today I'm urging you to please support
 
03:51:16.790 --> 03:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 39 99 I have a four-year-old
 
03:51:19.510 --> 03:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
son named Walter and our house was built
 
03:51:23.070 --> 03:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
about 1850 so on the advice of his
 
03:51:25.110 --> 03:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
doctor we started having his lead level
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
tested at age one and at age two it was
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
was positive both times so we continued
 
03:51:32.910 --> 03:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
testing um last year his lead level
 
03:51:35.309 --> 03:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
spiked significantly and public health
 
03:51:37.349 --> 03:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
got involved so we ended up having to do
 
03:51:40.510 --> 03:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
lead abatement for our home and we're
 
03:51:42.349 --> 03:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
currently having to test his levels
 
03:51:44.950 --> 03:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
every three months to make sure that um
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
that his levels are decreasing and they
 
03:51:49.349 --> 03:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
are thank goodness um but it's been a
 
03:51:51.070 --> 03:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
real nightmare for our family feeling
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
that our own home is is poisoning our
 
03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
child um initially there are no symptoms
 
03:52:00.910 --> 03:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
to show that a child is being poisoned
 
03:52:03.030 --> 03:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
by lead the only way that you can know
 
03:52:05.910 --> 03:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
is to test um but lead poisoning can
 
03:52:09.269 --> 03:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
cause cognitive um impairment stunted
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
growth hearing loss um impulsivity and
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
behavioral problems and multitude of
 
03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
other of other health and behavioral
 
03:52:21.389 --> 03:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
problems um the future of our state
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
depends on protecting our most
 
03:52:22.880 --> 03:52:24.349 align:start position:0%
depends on protecting our most
vulnerable

03:52:24.349 --> 03:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
citizens um so there is a recent law
 
03:52:29.149 --> 03:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
mandating that all children in New
 
03:52:30.990 --> 03:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have their lead levels tested
 
03:52:34.149 --> 03:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
at age one and Age Two however many
 
03:52:37.229 --> 03:52:37.239 align:start position:0%
children are still not getting tested um
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
to increase access to testing for all
 
03:52:44.830 --> 03:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
children um this law would would reduce
 
03:52:48.790 --> 03:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
barriers to testing and make it um make
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
it make sure that insurance will cover
 
03:52:52.710 --> 03:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
both the testing and follow-up testing
 
03:52:55.030 --> 03:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
if it's required as it was for my son
 
03:52:58.870 --> 03:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
because his levels were were High um so
 
03:53:01.349 --> 03:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
this would help New Hampshire's most at
 
03:53:03.389 --> 03:53:03.399 align:start position:0%
risk children receive the testing that
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
they need so again thank you for the
 
03:53:07.830 --> 03:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today and I urge
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
you to vote a to pass for this
 
03:53:12.990 --> 03:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
bill question great representative
 
03:53:16.149 --> 03:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
Herbert has a question um
 
03:53:18.990 --> 03:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
young kids young families um not every
 
03:53:24.070 --> 03:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
young family is uh well funded and um
 
03:53:27.389 --> 03:53:27.399 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if their one of their
 
03:53:27.399 --> 03:53:28.469 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if their one of their
children

03:53:28.469 --> 03:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:53:34.149 --> 03:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
or uh um do what have happened to you um
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
and uh they're on Medicaid because they
 
03:53:40.110 --> 03:53:40.120 align:start position:0%
can't qualify for and they can't pay for
 
03:53:42.910 --> 03:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know commercial insurance or the
 
03:53:45.710 --> 03:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
like I was just a my question and I
 
03:53:48.149 --> 03:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
don't you don't have to answer this is
 
03:53:51.950 --> 03:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
does Medicaid actually cover the um the
 
03:53:53.349 --> 03:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
treatment for
 
03:53:56.790 --> 03:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
lead we're getting the head shakes
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that's
 
03:54:06.429 --> 03:54:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:09.750 --> 03:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
much uh next up is uh Kirsten Cornell
 
03:54:22.189 --> 03:54:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:24.389 --> 03:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
better okay hi kirson Cornell New
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistants I'm here
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
today uh to support this bill we've
 
03:54:30.990 --> 03:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit about um the
 
03:54:33.790 --> 03:54:33.800 align:start position:0%
disabling impact that lead poisoning can
 
03:54:36.750 --> 03:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
have um and I won't spend a lot of time
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
talking about it because it's really not
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know the Crux of this bill but I
 
03:54:44.750 --> 03:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
think it's important to recognize the
 
03:54:47.429 --> 03:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
impact that lead poisoning has on the
 
03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy overall so Studies
 
03:54:54.389 --> 03:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
have been done that indicate um lead
 
03:54:56.630 --> 03:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
poisoning so lead poisoning causes
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
lifelong disabling executive functions
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
disabling um for the child's entire life
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
so this results uh Studies have shown in
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
an increased need for special education
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
services um increased cost to the
 
03:55:14.429 --> 03:55:14.439 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system increased cost
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
to unemployment due to
 
03:55:19.349 --> 03:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
underemployment um all of these things
 
03:55:21.910 --> 03:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
have a huge impact on the New Hampshire
 
03:55:25.590 --> 03:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
economy so aside from wanting to protect
 
03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
our youngest um State residents it's
 
03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
also important to note that it has these
 
03:55:32.429 --> 03:55:32.439 align:start position:0%
broad reaching
 
03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
impacts um I'm a housing attorney and
 
03:55:38.950 --> 03:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
the reason that this is so important in
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
my work directly is that we don't have
 
03:55:43.710 --> 03:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire what's called primary
 
03:55:45.189 --> 03:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
prevention which means that there aren't
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
any steps that we take to ensure that
 
03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
children don't get poisoned in the first
 
03:55:51.750 --> 03:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
place so the way that we become aware of
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
lead hazards by and large in homes um is
 
03:55:57.630 --> 03:55:57.640 align:start position:0%
when we identify a child as having an
 
03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
elevated blood lead level and the way
 
03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
that that identification happens is by
 
03:56:06.309 --> 03:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
these um two uh mandatory screening so
 
03:56:07.990 --> 03:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
there is an opt out since we're in New
 
03:56:12.269 --> 03:56:12.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and that's how we are then
 
03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
able to the state is able to investigate
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
properties to see if there are lead
 
03:56:20.110 --> 03:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
hazards in homes so this has to do with
 
03:56:23.229 --> 03:56:23.239 align:start position:0%
um rented homes I think that it's
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
important to note that so to your point
 
03:56:27.269 --> 03:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid Medicaid has required
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
this testing um I believe since the '90s
 
03:56:33.309 --> 03:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
it's been um quite a long time and the
 
03:56:35.870 --> 03:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
reason that uh Medicaid was doing it
 
03:56:38.110 --> 03:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
first is that uh there was a
 
03:56:39.870 --> 03:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
determination that kids who are on
 
03:56:41.590 --> 03:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid generally were at a higher risk
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
for lead poisoning so back in
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
2018 uh we worked on some legislation um
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
to require the uh private insurance
 
03:56:54.510 --> 03:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
carrier to to require testing throughout
 
03:56:57.750 --> 03:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
the state and and seek this um uh you
 
03:56:59.790 --> 03:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
know not have there be a burden a cost
 
03:57:02.469 --> 03:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
burden to parents because the amount of
 
03:57:05.429 --> 03:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
housing stock in the state that is uh
 
03:57:08.229 --> 03:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
built prior to when lead poison or use
 
03:57:12.229 --> 03:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
of lead paint was banned is over 60% uh
 
03:57:14.670 --> 03:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is rental housing
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
um and just a small amount of lead dust
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
can poison a child um I think folks are
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%
aware of the housing crisis we're facing
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
and this has far-reaching impacts as
 
03:57:27.429 --> 03:57:27.439 align:start position:0%
well because what you're seeing is kids
 
03:57:30.349 --> 03:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
who maybe would ordinarily be living in
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
a home that their parents owned are
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
renting are in a rental um situation
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
where they don't have as much control
 
03:57:40.030 --> 03:57:40.040 align:start position:0%
over maintenance things and exposure to
 
03:57:41.950 --> 03:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
hazards but they do have private
 
03:57:44.590 --> 03:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
insurance so they don't qualify for the
 
03:57:46.110 --> 03:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid program that will ensure
 
03:57:49.309 --> 03:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
coverage and has for for decades um so
 
03:57:51.309 --> 03:57:51.319 align:start position:0%
they will rely on this private insurance
 
03:57:53.830 --> 03:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
but because you know finances are tight
 
03:57:55.229 --> 03:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
right now I think that people are pretty
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
aware of that you know there's an opt
 
03:57:59.149 --> 03:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
out provision in the statute so I think
 
03:58:02.110 --> 03:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
if parents are fearful that the test
 
03:58:04.469 --> 03:58:04.479 align:start position:0%
won't be covered um you know they may
 
03:58:07.469 --> 03:58:07.479 align:start position:0%
opt out of it and and that also has uh
 
03:58:10.030 --> 03:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
far-reaching consequences for the
 
03:58:12.110 --> 03:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
overall housing conditions in in the
 
03:58:14.590 --> 03:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
state because you know once and Le
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
Hazard is identified it has to be
 
03:58:18.830 --> 03:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
remediated which improves housing
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
conditions overall and prevents you know
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
the next kid who lives in that house
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
from being poisoned um and and this is
 
03:58:29.189 --> 03:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
again particularly important during a
 
03:58:31.429 --> 03:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
housing crisis because tenants are very
 
03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
afraid of reporting conditions issues
 
03:58:35.590 --> 03:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
for fear of being evicted because
 
03:58:37.790 --> 03:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
there's really no place to go but in
 
03:58:39.950 --> 03:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
this instance it's not the tenants they
 
03:58:41.910 --> 03:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
aren't the ones who have to report it
 
03:58:44.309 --> 03:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
the state reports it and so it takes of
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
the heat off of them and also requires
 
03:58:48.309 --> 03:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
the landlord to provide some assistance
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
and relocation during the time that the
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
um you know the remediation work is
 
03:58:55.590 --> 03:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
being done so I just you know we do
 
03:58:57.429 --> 03:58:57.439 align:start position:0%
support this bill I think that this is a
 
03:59:00.389 --> 03:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
particularly important moment to ensure
 
03:59:02.389 --> 03:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
that these tests are covered by private
 
03:59:05.229 --> 03:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
insurance companies not just Medicaid um
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
so that you know we don't have barriers
 
03:59:09.750 --> 03:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
to testing that kids can receive the
 
03:59:11.149 --> 03:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
kids who are poisoned can receive the
 
03:59:12.830 --> 03:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
early intervention services that they
 
03:59:16.070 --> 03:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
need right now and the you know next kid
 
03:59:18.110 --> 03:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
to move into that house won't need that
 
03:59:19.950 --> 03:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
help at all so I know I talked for a
 
03:59:21.110 --> 03:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
while thank you very much for listening
 
03:59:21.870 --> 03:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
to my
 
03:59:24.309 --> 03:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
testimony another question thank you
 
03:59:26.510 --> 03:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert has yet another
 
03:59:31.110 --> 03:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
question um forgive me my ignorance but
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
is lead poisoning uh limited to one and
 
03:59:36.750 --> 03:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
two year olds it's not so it's most
 
03:59:39.269 --> 03:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
common for young children to be lead
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
poisoned because um up until the age of
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
six children don't have what's called
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
the blood brain barrier and please don't
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
ask me to explain that in any more
 
03:59:50.510 --> 03:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
detail than that um and so the way that
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
the body absorbs the lead dust is the
 
03:59:56.830 --> 03:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
the body can't uh keep it from getting
 
03:59:59.070 --> 03:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
into the brain as well and it's most
 
04:00:01.469 --> 04:00:01.479 align:start position:0%
common for children uh you know when
 
04:00:04.510 --> 04:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're up until toddlers to be poisoned
 
04:00:08.349 --> 04:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
because they're on the floor so unlike
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
the the um I think idea that people have
 
04:00:14.149 --> 04:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
where you need this big piece of Chip of
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
paint to eat in order to become poison
 
04:00:18.030 --> 04:00:18.040 align:start position:0%
like just a small amount of dust that
 
04:00:19.710 --> 04:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
can be picked up with a child crawling
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
around the floor putting some putting
 
04:00:22.710 --> 04:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
their hands in their mouth putting
 
04:00:24.189 --> 04:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
everything in their mouth for anybody
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
who's had a child in this room um that's
 
04:00:29.349 --> 04:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
when they're most at risk and and it's
 
04:00:32.189 --> 04:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
important to catch you know as soon as
 
04:00:34.469 --> 04:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
possible and so that's why the Mandate
 
04:00:36.630 --> 04:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
the mandated testing was ages one and
 
04:00:38.990 --> 04:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
two and it's possible people behind me
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
will know more about that but that's the
 
04:00:45.950 --> 04:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:45.960 --> 04:00:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:49.990 --> 04:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
burough I know this isn't part sorry
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I know
 
04:00:52.830 --> 04:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
this isn't part of the bill and maybe
 
04:00:54.910 --> 04:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
peripheral but shouldn't we also be
 
04:00:57.910 --> 04:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
doing more to ensure that home Sellers
 
04:01:00.990 --> 04:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
and landlords do remediation before kids
 
04:01:02.750 --> 04:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
move into these places so we don't have
 
04:01:05.990 --> 04:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
to go through all this yes absolutely
 
04:01:08.269 --> 04:01:08.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank we should be doing that you
 
04:01:11.189 --> 04:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
asked the right person for that
 
04:01:13.710 --> 04:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
question yes represent pelli I have a
 
04:01:15.550 --> 04:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
question about the scope of the bill so
 
04:01:17.229 --> 04:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
if you don't know the answer no problem
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about it I'm sure in
 
04:01:21.429 --> 04:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so the way I understand it
 
04:01:24.429 --> 04:01:24.439 align:start position:0%
that it's the initial test that's
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
inconclusive and one followup is the
 
04:01:32.429 --> 04:01:32.439 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill correct so my
 
04:01:35.510 --> 04:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that yeah at both the
 
04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
first and second year um appointment so
 
04:01:41.550 --> 04:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
you know if a kid tests positive if they
 
04:01:43.510 --> 04:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
don't test positive so let's say they
 
04:01:45.670 --> 04:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
test positive and at when they're one
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
and they need a followup you know
 
04:01:49.149 --> 04:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
they'll get screened again at two and
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's possible they'll need a follow up
 
04:01:52.870 --> 04:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
then so I would assume that that would
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
be part of the screening process um and
 
04:01:57.550 --> 04:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
it would apply in those circumstances as
 
04:02:00.030 --> 04:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
well yeah I'd like to understand like
 
04:02:00.040 --> 04:02:01.309 align:start position:0%
well yeah I'd like to understand like
when

04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:02:03.590 --> 04:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
it okay it's all about timing in terms
 
04:02:06.429 --> 04:02:06.439 align:start position:0%
of the year two years within two years
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
you yeah but not the ongoing after two
 
04:02:11.309 --> 04:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
years it's there's something else not
 
04:02:12.990 --> 04:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
this there's no mandate exctly and
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid covers it and private insurance
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
may or may not depending on the
 
04:02:19.710 --> 04:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
insurance right so well okay there was
 
04:02:21.309 --> 04:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
some implication that private insurance
 
04:02:23.950 --> 04:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
companies were taking wanting a co-pay
 
04:02:26.830 --> 04:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
or deductible and that is clearly what's
 
04:02:31.389 --> 04:02:31.399 align:start position:0%
being deleted thank you okay represent
 
04:02:32.550 --> 04:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for your
 
04:02:34.870 --> 04:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
testimony um I was listening to your
 
04:02:36.830 --> 04:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and you mentioned that uh the
 
04:02:38.830 --> 04:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
blood brain barrier is not fully
 
04:02:41.229 --> 04:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
developed till the age of six could you
 
04:02:42.349 --> 04:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
tell us where we could find that
 
04:02:44.309 --> 04:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
information or learn more about that so
 
04:02:46.189 --> 04:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
that's information that I have gained
 
04:02:48.030 --> 04:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
through going to a variety of
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
presentations um by medical experts in
 
04:02:53.469 --> 04:02:53.479 align:start position:0%
the field um I imagine that the American
 
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
Association of Pediatrics would probably
 
04:02:57.550 --> 04:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
uh be able to have that
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
information um uh like I said I it's I
 
04:03:03.550 --> 04:03:03.560 align:start position:0%
for a period of time was doing a lot of
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
work around lead hazards and homes and
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to go to a lot of
 
04:03:09.710 --> 04:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
presentations and that was um what was
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
consistently explained to me so I would
 
04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
assume a medical provider a a
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
pediatrician someone along those lines
 
04:03:18.630 --> 04:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
would be able to give you the
 
04:03:22.670 --> 04:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
MD okay yes representative
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
ton yeah in response to representative
 
04:03:32.269 --> 04:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
ammon's question I would refer you to
 
04:03:34.710 --> 04:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Healthy homes and lead
 
04:03:38.670 --> 04:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
poisoning prevention program they have
 
04:03:38.680 --> 04:03:40.710 align:start position:0%
poisoning prevention program they have
extensive

04:03:40.710 --> 04:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
04:03:44.670 --> 04:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
information uh and they are more than
 
04:03:46.389 --> 04:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
happy to share this I'm sure with
 
04:03:47.950 --> 04:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
04:03:50.750 --> 04:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and I can share that contact
 
04:03:53.110 --> 04:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
information with you if you
 
04:03:53.120 --> 04:03:55.189 align:start position:0%
information with you if you
want

04:03:55.189 --> 04:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
want
 
04:03:57.389 --> 04:03:57.399 align:start position:0%
great represent M
 
04:04:00.429 --> 04:04:00.439 align:start position:0%
you this is an issue that came before
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
the the other committee I serve on and
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
would you believe that July of this year
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lead paint certification act
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
that goes into effect July 1st of 2024 I
 
04:04:15.790 --> 04:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
was actually actually passed in I did
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
just have to look it up but 2018 but it
 
04:04:19.510 --> 04:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
came up because we were modifying the
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
real estate
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
form uh so effect of July of this year
 
04:04:26.469 --> 04:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
there's a for I think it's just new
 
04:04:29.990 --> 04:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
construction as I quickly read it uh for
 
04:04:33.269 --> 04:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
rentals and daycare there's a new lead
 
04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
paint certification and that's as much
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
as I could glean quickly but it's it's
 
04:04:41.070 --> 04:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
right on point for this and if just now
 
04:04:42.990 --> 04:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
going into effect six years after
 
04:04:45.830 --> 04:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
Passage it's called a would you believe
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
04:04:50.149 --> 04:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
just somewhere else was that a question
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
yes but maybe you maybe you know more
 
04:04:54.550 --> 04:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
about it actually than I could just um I
 
04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
I it does apply only to uh new
 
04:04:59.429 --> 04:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
construction uh everything you said
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
about it is about the extent to which I
 
04:05:03.149 --> 04:05:03.159 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with it but um
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately no it doesn't require any
 
04:05:08.429 --> 04:05:08.439 align:start position:0%
work to be done on uh homes that were
 
04:05:09.950 --> 04:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
previously built or or daycare
 
04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
facilities and the reason that's
 
04:05:13.229 --> 04:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunate is that the use of lead
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
paint was band until 1978 and until 1950
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
it was nearly ubiquitous so it's
 
04:05:21.790 --> 04:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
everywhere um and it's it's great that
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's a certificate going forward you
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
can't really use it now anyway but yeah
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
let's do everything we can um I hope
 
04:05:30.269 --> 04:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
that in the future we'll be able to to
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
get some work done on the older homes
 
04:05:37.149 --> 04:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
too great thank you very much thank
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
04:05:39.439 --> 04:05:42.630 align:start position:0%
you uh

trarco representing
 
04:05:49.149 --> 04:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
clf oh I know this this
 
04:05:49.159 --> 04:05:51.110 align:start position:0%
clf oh I know this this
is

04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:05:53.790 --> 04:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
uh tell us what it
 
04:05:57.149 --> 04:05:57.159 align:start position:0%
is good afternoon we met before Heidi
 
04:05:59.710 --> 04:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
Mar with the conservation law CF I
 
04:06:01.710 --> 04:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know if you wanted I knew it to
 
04:06:04.269 --> 04:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
get there if you wanted me to uh thank
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
you for hearing my testimony I'll keep
 
04:06:08.429 --> 04:06:08.439 align:start position:0%
it brief because um um working with
 
04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
other Le partners and you just heard
 
04:06:12.189 --> 04:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
some other testimonies so um we're all
 
04:06:14.830 --> 04:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
working kind of in in concert to get
 
04:06:17.630 --> 04:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
this bill passed um we urge the
 
04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
committee to vote a to pass as the
 
04:06:23.229 --> 04:06:23.239 align:start position:0%
committee heard as a result of SB 248 in
 
04:06:25.950 --> 04:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
2018 the state required all one and two
 
04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
yearolds to be tested for blood lead
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
levels and we have that data now um and
 
04:06:35.189 --> 04:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
the DHHS puts out a data brief what that
 
04:06:36.670 --> 04:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
has all of that evidence and you can
 
04:06:38.269 --> 04:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
look it up and see all the evidence of
 
04:06:42.110 --> 04:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
lead poisoning in the state um in 2022
 
04:06:44.950 --> 04:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
8816 children in New Hampshire were
 
04:06:47.550 --> 04:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
poisoned by lead so this is a really
 
04:06:49.630 --> 04:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
prevalent problem in our state and it's
 
04:06:51.550 --> 04:06:51.560 align:start position:0%
something that we know we know what the
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
problem is we know where the science is
 
04:06:55.790 --> 04:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
and we know how to um address it and how
 
04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
to prevent it and so um we look forward
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
to legislation working to prevent lead
 
04:07:04.189 --> 04:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
poisoning in the future this bill is to
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
fix a gap in the um just in the
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for that testing for
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
the one and two year olds and so um it
 
04:07:13.070 --> 04:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
was always the intent that the insurance
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
would cover for that testing and this
 
04:07:18.269 --> 04:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
bill just clarifies that and uh we urge
 
04:07:20.790 --> 04:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote ought to
 
04:07:20.800 --> 04:07:22.510 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote ought to
pass

04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:07:25.030 --> 04:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank
 
04:07:34.710 --> 04:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.109 --> 04:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
Futures thank you Mr chairman honorable
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this is my
 
04:07:40.469 --> 04:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
first time before you this year I'm
 
04:07:42.109 --> 04:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
pinch hitting for one of my colleagues
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
Jake Barry who I'm sure that you have
 
04:07:47.229 --> 04:07:47.239 align:start position:0%
seen before um I am happy to share new
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
futur position on this particular piece
 
04:07:52.389 --> 04:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
of legislation um we worked with the
 
04:07:54.269 --> 04:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
original group of stakeholders back in
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
2018 around the universal testing of um
 
04:08:00.990 --> 04:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
childhood Le levels uh and at that time
 
04:08:02.910 --> 04:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
we have the legislative history as well
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
as our own notes that it was fully the
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
intent of this legislature to ensure the
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
full cost and coverage um of children
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
when they were being if they were
 
04:08:14.429 --> 04:08:14.439 align:start position:0%
privately insured for those tests
 
04:08:16.389 --> 04:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
unfortunately new Futures is also the
 
04:08:18.189 --> 04:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
kids count Organization for the State of
 
04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and we received some
 
04:08:23.590 --> 04:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information from some of our
 
04:08:25.630 --> 04:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
Advocates and Community Partners that
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
the universal coverage was not actually
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
happening um we also looked at the data
 
04:08:33.309 --> 04:08:33.319 align:start position:0%
and saw between after the law was passed
 
04:08:36.269 --> 04:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
in 2018 we saw a spike in the number of
 
04:08:38.149 --> 04:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
kids that were being tested as you would
 
04:08:40.189 --> 04:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
presume when there's a universal testing
 
04:08:42.429 --> 04:08:42.439 align:start position:0%
requirement however after covid it
 
04:08:44.870 --> 04:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
dropped by 25 % and we were really
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
scratching our heads as to what was
 
04:08:48.990 --> 04:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
happening some of it was covid related
 
04:08:51.070 --> 04:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
um but that wasn't the entire story and
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
we started to receive more and more
 
04:08:55.550 --> 04:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
examples of cost sharing that was being
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
passed on to parents in conflict with
 
04:08:59.950 --> 04:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
what the underlying intent of the
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislature was in
 
04:09:05.429 --> 04:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
2018 um we also just want to reiterate
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
the points that were made by some of our
 
04:09:09.149 --> 04:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
other colleagues that spoke on behalf of
 
04:09:11.389 --> 04:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
the bill prior that there are currently
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
32,000 kids in this state who are living
 
04:09:15.630 --> 04:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
in homes where there are known Le
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
hazards um this bill is a necessary
 
04:09:21.109 --> 04:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
statutory clarification so that we can
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
close the gap that currently exists
 
04:09:25.870 --> 04:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
while the insurance department did Issue
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
a bulletin we we do believe that
 
04:09:29.790 --> 04:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
statutory clarification would be
 
04:09:31.510 --> 04:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
important in this particular
 
04:09:34.349 --> 04:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
case um let me see if there's anything
 
04:09:35.349 --> 04:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
else that I want to share that hasn't
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
already been
 
04:09:39.109 --> 04:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
said again it just reaffirms the intent
 
04:09:41.229 --> 04:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
of the 2018 legislation and provides the
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
needed clarification so I'm happy to
 
04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that folks may have
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
um but that is the experience of new
 
04:09:49.510 --> 04:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
Futures and the folks that we work with
 
04:09:51.550 --> 04:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
community great thank you nice to see
 
04:09:56.750 --> 04:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
you again thank
 
04:10:00.269 --> 04:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
you okay anybody else would like to
 
04:10:00.279 --> 04:10:02.030 align:start position:0%
you okay anybody else would like to
weigh

04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
weigh
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
in seeing none we'll close the public
 
04:10:04.920 --> 04:10:35.389 align:start position:0%
in seeing none we'll close the public
hearing

04:10:35.389 --> 04:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.590 --> 04:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh ledge Etc just send it to house
 
04:10:43.710 --> 04:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
Commerce that'll that'll go to everybody
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
specifically about the blood brain
 
04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
barrier not fully developed by six years
 
04:10:50.109 --> 04:10:50.119 align:start position:0%
of age that's that's what he wanted to
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
accurate well that's what I'm looking
 
04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
for he wants to know how they came he
 
04:11:02.550 --> 04:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
settled on Sixx six years of age there's
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
no blood brain barrier that seems crazy
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:10.950 --> 04:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
it well I'd like to see a source that's
 
04:11:20.750 --> 04:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:03.870 --> 04:12:03.880 align:start position:0%

04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
Senator uh thank you Mr chairman members
 
04:17:10.030 --> 04:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Senator David
 
04:17:13.670 --> 04:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
Waters from uh District 4 uh introducing
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 353 relative to insurance
 
04:17:19.710 --> 04:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
coverage for autism spectrum disorder
 
04:17:22.030 --> 04:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
and down syndrome as you can see from
 
04:17:23.830 --> 04:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill it changes a
 
04:17:26.309 --> 04:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
couple of um definitions in a sense
 
04:17:29.070 --> 04:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
brings them up to date where the most uh
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
Rec recent desk manual is uh so we have
 
04:17:34.910 --> 04:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorder and including
 
04:17:38.469 --> 04:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh Down syndrome in a definitional part
 
04:17:40.950 --> 04:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
um and then the heart of the bill is the
 
04:17:42.830 --> 04:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
availability then due to these new def
 
04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
definitions of um coverage for uh
 
04:17:48.710 --> 04:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
treatment in particular as you'll hear
 
04:17:50.389 --> 04:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
from The Advocates who will follow me
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
and some from healthc Care Professionals
 
04:17:54.309 --> 04:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
um we're particularly talking about
 
04:17:56.990 --> 04:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
applied behavor behavioral
 
04:18:01.469 --> 04:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
analysis um and uh this uh therapy for
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
those with autism and down syndrome has
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
been demonstrated as one letter we had
 
04:18:08.710 --> 04:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
in the Senate from a physician is a kind
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
of gold standard for helpful treatment
 
04:18:15.189 --> 04:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh here um so that that that's the uh
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
essential part of this I think we're
 
04:18:18.790 --> 04:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
going to hear from some families and
 
04:18:21.389 --> 04:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
Advocates as to how this kind of therapy
 
04:18:25.070 --> 04:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
has has helped um and I will leave more
 
04:18:27.149 --> 04:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
of that medical uh discussion to the
 
04:18:29.429 --> 04:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
folks who follow I did want to say a
 
04:18:31.429 --> 04:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
little bit because here we are in in
 
04:18:33.429 --> 04:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
Commerce and of course the insurance
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
costs and other things are will be of
 
04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
concern um to you and as you will see
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
that uh the the bill will have no
 
04:18:43.149 --> 04:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
fisical impact this year and physcal
 
04:18:44.830 --> 04:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
note suggests that it's rather it's
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat indeterminant as to how many
 
04:18:49.469 --> 04:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
more cases will come um in the following
 
04:18:51.109 --> 04:18:51.119 align:start position:0%
years and potentially have some kind of
 
04:18:55.630 --> 04:18:55.640 align:start position:0%
cost or or impact um if it helps uh in
 
04:18:58.229 --> 04:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearing when um there was a
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
question about well how many people
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
might you know be covered by this and
 
04:19:04.590 --> 04:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
there is a a physician down in
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who is a kind of go-to
 
04:19:08.910 --> 04:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
person and for Massachusetts about 80
 
04:19:11.109 --> 04:19:11.119 align:start position:0%
people and that would translate in terms
 
04:19:14.790 --> 04:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
of population to maybe 14 up here um so
 
04:19:16.030 --> 04:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
um yes you know there is little
 
04:19:17.429 --> 04:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
uncertainty over the costs and the
 
04:19:19.950 --> 04:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
insurance impacts but um I I do think
 
04:19:22.870 --> 04:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to see um the benefits that
 
04:19:26.229 --> 04:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
this might provide to families and uh it
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
explains why after the hearing there was
 
04:19:31.109 --> 04:19:31.119 align:start position:0%
such um strong strong bipartisan support
 
04:19:33.229 --> 04:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
in the Senate as you can see from the
 
04:19:36.229 --> 04:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
folks who are um lined up here and you
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
know a lot of us have personal stories
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
um uh with autism and and Down Down
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
Syndrome from from family members and uh
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
I think we know the extraordinary
 
04:19:49.229 --> 04:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
progress that a caring Society like ours
 
04:19:51.670 --> 04:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
has made towards uh making sure that
 
04:19:53.630 --> 04:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
families get their help so people can
 
04:19:56.349 --> 04:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
leave uh leave lead full and productive
 
04:19:59.229 --> 04:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
lives um as much as much as possible and
 
04:20:01.710 --> 04:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
get the kind of help so um this I think
 
04:20:03.790 --> 04:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
this is a a very good step forward for
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
the state to be able to cover uh ABA and
 
04:20:09.070 --> 04:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
that's why the bill is here and Mr
 
04:20:11.189 --> 04:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
chairman I think questions for me would
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh very quickly get beyond what I can
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
meaningfully offer so I I would be happy
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
to take any but I think what you're
 
04:20:19.950 --> 04:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
going to hear from the folks behind me
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
who have very deep experience on the
 
04:20:23.349 --> 04:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
personal and medical side of this would
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
spent okay thank
 
04:20:33.389 --> 04:20:33.399 align:start position:0%

04:20:37.109 --> 04:20:37.119 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill 353 to broaden insurance
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
coverage for Applied Behavior Analysis
 
04:21:31.229 --> 04:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
to include people with Down
 
04:21:34.349 --> 04:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
Syndrome uh ABA therapy applied Behavior
 
04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
Analysis therapy is a scientific
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
evidence-based therapy that has been in
 
04:21:40.830 --> 04:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
effect for the last 60 years or
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
so um I'm shaking a little bit I haven't

done this since Connor's
[Music]

04:21:45.870 --> 04:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:21:45.880 --> 04:21:47.630 align:start position:0%
[Music]
[Laughter]

04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:21:50.349 --> 04:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
law um I'm a parent of a child with
 
04:21:52.469 --> 04:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
autism who has benefited from ABA
 
04:21:55.510 --> 04:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
therapy he's now 16 he's had ABA therapy
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
for 12 of the last 16 years it was ped
 
04:22:00.550 --> 04:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
um the year Connor's law was passed was
 
04:22:02.429 --> 04:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
the Year my son was diagnosed with
 
04:22:05.309 --> 04:22:05.319 align:start position:0%
autism I'm also a bcba and what that
 
04:22:07.790 --> 04:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
means is I'm a board certified behavior
 
04:22:10.349 --> 04:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
analyst and what that means is I have a
 
04:22:13.149 --> 04:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
master's degree in education
 
04:22:15.870 --> 04:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
and I also had 1500 hours of supervised
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
experience I've been in the field for 24
 
04:22:20.590 --> 04:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
years and I've been certified for 16
 
04:22:22.750 --> 04:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
years uh someone asked me how many
 
04:22:25.229 --> 04:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
people I've worked with and I'm going to
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
go with
 
04:22:29.550 --> 04:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
hundreds I honestly don't know um but I
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you a little bit
 
04:22:33.550 --> 04:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
about the people that I've worked with
 
04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
um I've worked with teenagers with Down
 
04:22:37.990 --> 04:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
Syndrome Who as a result of ABA
 
04:22:41.109 --> 04:22:41.119 align:start position:0%
intervention have gone on to become
 
04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers and have paid employment and
 
04:22:46.429 --> 04:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
become productive members of
 
04:22:48.870 --> 04:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
society I have worked recently with
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
Elementary age children who as a result
 
04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
of ABA intervention have been able to
 
04:22:56.670 --> 04:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
stay in the general education setting
 
04:22:58.510 --> 04:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
and do not need substantially separate
 
04:23:01.469 --> 04:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
or special education placements so
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's really exciting that
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
children with Down Syndrome benefit will
 
04:23:08.469 --> 04:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
benefit just like children with autism
 
04:23:10.830 --> 04:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
do from ABA
 
04:23:13.229 --> 04:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
therapy I have also consulted and met
 
04:23:14.830 --> 04:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
with families who have loved ones with
 
04:23:17.109 --> 04:23:17.119 align:start position:0%
Down Syndrome unfortunately due to not
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
having ABA therapy coverage through
 
04:23:21.149 --> 04:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
their insurance I was not able to help
 
04:23:23.469 --> 04:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
them I've seen these families struggle
 
04:23:26.070 --> 04:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
with communication social skills
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
maladaptive behaviors that all could be
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
therapy please consider all these things
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
that I have shared with you and that you
 
04:23:38.790 --> 04:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
could change lives for those with Down
 
04:23:41.109 --> 04:23:41.119 align:start position:0%
Syndrome for less than 20 cents per
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
policy year oop I skipped apart sorry um
 
04:23:46.590 --> 04:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
these children with ABA may also
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
struggle with toilet tra toilet training
 
04:23:51.189 --> 04:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
feeding and dressing skills learning how
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
to speak or to be understood by others
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
and how to have a back and forth
 
04:23:56.750 --> 04:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with a peer or how to
 
04:23:59.070 --> 04:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
follow a daily schedule all these
 
04:24:00.750 --> 04:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
symptoms that a child with Down Syndrome
 
04:24:04.189 --> 04:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
may have may be remediated by ABA so
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
please support Senate Bill 353 to
 
04:24:08.870 --> 04:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
broaden insurance coverage for ABA to
 
04:24:10.830 --> 04:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
include people with Down Syndrome thank
 
04:24:10.840 --> 04:24:13.349 align:start position:0%
include people with Down Syndrome thank
you

04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay you do have questions represent
 
04:24:17.149 --> 04:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:24:19.750 --> 04:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony you did great oh thanks
 
04:24:22.030 --> 04:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
um I just have a question on uh line
 
04:24:24.590 --> 04:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
three of the bill it's uh letter h i
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
I'll just it's a strike out the bill
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
Strikes Out pervasive developmental
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
disorder or Autism so it strikes that
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
out and it changes it to autism spectrum
 
04:24:38.910 --> 04:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
disorder y um is that is that an
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
outdated term why why what are we
 
04:24:43.229 --> 04:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
striking out and what are we um I I
 
04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
didn't write the bill but I can share
 
04:24:46.790 --> 04:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
with you what I know medically pervasive
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
developmental disorder what what is that
 
04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so before um in the dsm5 the
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
diagnostic statistic manual it when this
 
04:24:58.670 --> 04:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
was first um it was first called pddn
 
04:25:01.189 --> 04:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
pervasive development disorder and then
 
04:25:03.630 --> 04:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorder and then
 
04:25:05.790 --> 04:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
Aspergers and so what they did with the
 
04:25:08.189 --> 04:25:08.199 align:start position:0%
dsm5 as they took it and just called it
 
04:25:10.830 --> 04:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorder and took out
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
the PDD part and the asp burer
 
04:25:15.870 --> 04:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
part just follow father question you may
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
inquire so the the autism spectrum
 
04:25:21.030 --> 04:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
disorder what percentage of children
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
roughly would fall into that Spectrum
 
04:25:25.870 --> 04:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
just curious about the numbers um right
 
04:25:29.950 --> 04:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
now 1 in 36 as of a couple months
 
04:25:32.670 --> 04:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
ago okay representative
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
prelli thank you for your testimony
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
today can can you please explain a
 
04:25:41.189 --> 04:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what exactly ABA
 
04:25:44.550 --> 04:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
therapy or treat is and if you know
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
anything related to the costs associated
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
with it I don't know what the treatment
 
04:25:51.790 --> 04:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
would entail okay all right I'm going to
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
do my best I'm sweating it out
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
here um well aba therapy is to help
 
04:25:59.750 --> 04:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
people with things that are socially
 
04:26:01.830 --> 04:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
significant you know so activities of
 
04:26:05.189 --> 04:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
daily living communication social skills
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
and what that involves is someone like
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
myself writing a treatment plan so I
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
might meet with a family or with a
 
04:26:12.870 --> 04:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
student and find out what some things
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
that they would like to see and what are
 
04:26:16.750 --> 04:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
some things they that you would like to
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
decrease um often children with
 
04:26:22.349 --> 04:26:22.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities have behaviors um that are
 
04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
that are a result of having a lack of
 
04:26:26.269 --> 04:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
communication skills so what I would do
 
04:26:28.269 --> 04:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
is I would train somebody like a direct
 
04:26:30.429 --> 04:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
therapist or a registered Behavior
 
04:26:32.670 --> 04:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
technician and they're just someone that
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
I would train on how to carry out that
 
04:26:37.469 --> 04:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
treatment plan so I would teach them you
 
04:26:40.030 --> 04:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
know how to teach them um I guess Xander
 
04:26:41.950 --> 04:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
here learned how to brush his teeth you
 
04:26:44.429 --> 04:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
know or how to stop when someone says
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
stop a lot of times we help people with
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
safety and so we come in the home
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 10 to 40 hours a week or
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
in a clinic based setting and help
 
04:26:56.910 --> 04:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
remediate those symptoms of their
 
04:26:59.590 --> 04:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
disability did I answer all the
 
04:27:02.030 --> 04:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
questions okay all
 
04:27:05.790 --> 04:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
right the cost your your mic on say that
 
04:27:09.630 --> 04:27:09.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes thank you so I so it's uh
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's oneon-one counseling yes perhaps y
 
04:27:15.670 --> 04:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
with someone that can teach the skills
 
04:27:19.429 --> 04:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
based on your plan and it could be
 
04:27:23.429 --> 04:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
something that is minimal or um you know
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
very intensive that's correct so do you
 
04:27:29.269 --> 04:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
happen to know what how the costs are
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
calculated I don't know right now I
 
04:27:32.349 --> 04:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that maybe
 
04:27:35.349 --> 04:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
somebody else does here okay thank you
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
so how are you paid who who pays you so
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
I currently work for a school district
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm working with students right now
 
04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
but for years or 22 years I worked in
 
04:27:48.429 --> 04:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
home clinic and community based settings
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
so excuse me so each of these kids have
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
an IEP and you're the one who's
 
04:27:58.870 --> 04:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
handling okay so right now this is all
 
04:28:00.670 --> 04:28:00.680 align:start position:0%
being paid by the school district for
 
04:28:02.590 --> 04:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
the last two years in my position the
 
04:28:04.990 --> 04:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
previous 20 years I worked for an agency
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
for the state for agency of the state
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
and that was paid under Medicare a uh
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
for the adults yes other than that I did
 
04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
insurance-based Home Services you know
 
04:28:16.429 --> 04:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
like Harvard Pilgrim Blue Cross so some
 
04:28:19.790 --> 04:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
insurance companies do pay for it y okay
 
04:28:21.590 --> 04:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
so this this legislation is that there
 
04:28:23.349 --> 04:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
are some insurance companies are not
 
04:28:25.870 --> 04:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
paying for it they do for autism but not
 
04:28:28.510 --> 04:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
yet for Downs okay so they're only doing
 
04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
in the autism okay now we're clarifying
 
04:28:33.469 --> 04:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
it's a spectrum rather than and I and
 
04:28:35.710 --> 04:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
yes I think we're up to DSM 9 now or
 
04:28:37.510 --> 04:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
something I'm not
 
04:28:41.469 --> 04:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
sure we moved Along on DSM so generally
 
04:28:42.870 --> 04:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
04:28:45.990 --> 04:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh where this is often is being applied
 
04:28:49.990 --> 04:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
is um is in the school in this the IEPs
 
04:28:51.790 --> 04:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
in the school environment um in the
 
04:28:54.189 --> 04:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
school environment yes but most of what
 
04:28:55.469 --> 04:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
children need is through early
 
04:28:57.910 --> 04:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
intervention so they need the insurance
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
based coverage and that's what's being
 
04:29:02.429 --> 04:29:02.439 align:start position:0%
asked for here today right so I guess
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to so so this is just
 
04:29:07.229 --> 04:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
before schools then it could be before
 
04:29:08.590 --> 04:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
school it could be during school it
 
04:29:10.429 --> 04:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
could be after I'm saying it could be
 
04:29:13.870 --> 04:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
right so the Guess The $64,000 Question
 
04:29:17.109 --> 04:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
is um are we trying to get insurance
 
04:29:18.429 --> 04:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
companies to pay for something that
 
04:29:21.389 --> 04:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
schools are now paying for no this is a
 
04:29:23.269 --> 04:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
medical service it's a com it's a it's a
 
04:29:25.070 --> 04:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
medical service not an educational
 
04:29:27.309 --> 04:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
service not to be confused on the IEP
 
04:29:29.469 --> 04:29:29.479 align:start position:0%
and what's going on in the classroom
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it's completely
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
separate okay thank you now
 
04:29:36.469 --> 04:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
representative perz sorry didn't mean to
 
04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
interrupt you Mr chair um my question is
 
04:29:41.229 --> 04:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
we had a question about the costs
 
04:29:43.149 --> 04:29:43.159 align:start position:0%
involved in this what are the societal
 
04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
costs of not providing this kind of care
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
for for children with Down syndrome and
 
04:29:51.429 --> 04:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
that might be tough to to
 
04:29:54.149 --> 04:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
answer I I'll do my best I wasn't quite
 
04:29:56.429 --> 04:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
ready and prepared for this as a parent
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
I I would like
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
to what's that okay yeah as a parent
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be good answer too oh man um just
 
04:30:08.550 --> 04:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
we you know we got rid of Institutions
 
04:30:12.309 --> 04:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
for a reason you know um children who do
 
04:30:14.990 --> 04:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
not access just safety things such as
 
04:30:17.950 --> 04:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
when to stop and when to go um just
 
04:30:20.349 --> 04:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
potty training alone you know there
 
04:30:22.189 --> 04:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
there are children who are six seven
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
eight go on to adulthood unfortunately
 
04:30:28.070 --> 04:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
are not potty trained um the aggressive
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
behaviors the safety behaviors it
 
04:30:33.070 --> 04:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
results in in you know going back to you
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
know what would be group hones or
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
residential settings which obviously I
 
04:30:38.670 --> 04:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
know what the cost is that's hundreds of
 
04:30:41.149 --> 04:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for when children
 
04:30:43.070 --> 04:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
don't get these types of services that
 
04:30:43.080 --> 04:30:43.830 align:start position:0%
don't get these types of services that
they

04:30:43.830 --> 04:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:30:47.469 --> 04:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.630 --> 04:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
spear uh you made a comment very quickly
 
04:30:56.309 --> 04:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
in passing that the cost was 20 cents
 
04:30:58.590 --> 04:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
per member or 20 cents per person or
 
04:31:00.510 --> 04:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
something like that for the uh an
 
04:31:03.109 --> 04:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
estimate for the insurance what was that
 
04:31:05.469 --> 04:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
based on um I'm going to let somebody
 
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
else speak to that that was information
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
that was given to me that I asked for I
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know where the math
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay well represent
 
04:31:19.870 --> 04:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
woles thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:31:22.469 --> 04:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
for testifying do you happen to know how
 
04:31:25.149 --> 04:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
many ABA therapists there are throughout
 
04:31:25.159 --> 04:31:26.189 align:start position:0%
many ABA therapists there are throughout
the

04:31:26.189 --> 04:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:31:31.229 --> 04:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
state um well we have about 400 board
 
04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
certified Behavior analysts we do not
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
have enough to go
 
04:31:38.349 --> 04:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
around um I don't know how many
 
04:31:41.670 --> 04:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
technicians we have follow up for the
 
04:31:41.680 --> 04:31:42.469 align:start position:0%
technicians we have follow up for the
question

04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:31:45.429 --> 04:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you so you had mentioned earlier
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
that you can also train others to do
 
04:31:52.070 --> 04:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
this therapy if needed or is that common
 
04:31:55.590 --> 04:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
or yeah usually the bcba is um I guess
 
04:31:57.550 --> 04:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
you would say like a doctor is to a
 
04:32:00.269 --> 04:32:00.279 align:start position:0%
nurse or a medical assistant so the bcba
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
is the one that comes up with a plan and
 
04:32:03.550 --> 04:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
then they train the technician or the
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
direct therapist on how how to carry out
 
04:32:08.950 --> 04:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
or like a teacher to a pair professional
 
04:32:11.389 --> 04:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
okay so kind of like a Frontline worker
 
04:32:11.399 --> 04:32:13.630 align:start position:0%
okay so kind of like a Frontline worker

25-year-old son who has autism um please

insurance coverage for Applied Behavior
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
Analysis for people down syndrome and I
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
really want to clarify we we're talking
 
04:32:50.790 --> 04:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
about broadening insurance coverage to
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
include people with Down Syndrome uh the
 
04:32:55.469 --> 04:32:55.479 align:start position:0%
the talk about autism spectrum disorder
 
04:32:56.710 --> 04:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
and all that that's clarifying and
 
04:32:59.109 --> 04:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
updating language in the existing law
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not adding anything for
 
04:33:02.590 --> 04:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
people without autism people with Autism
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
already have the insurance coverage just
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
asking for including people with Down
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
Syndrome um I am the legislative liaison
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
for gateways Community Services out in
 
04:33:14.070 --> 04:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
aswa uh it's one of the 10 area agencies
 
04:33:16.830 --> 04:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
in the State uh that uh enables services
 
04:33:17.869 --> 04:33:17.879 align:start position:0%
for people with developmental
 
04:33:19.230 --> 04:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities and acquired brain
 
04:33:22.230 --> 04:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
disorders as a legislative liaison and
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
the I'm active Statewide and I also lead
 
04:33:26.750 --> 04:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
a group of approximately 280 families in
 
04:33:29.629 --> 04:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
my area to ADV advocate for appropriate
 
04:33:31.310 --> 04:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
policy that enables people with
 
04:33:32.709 --> 04:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and acquired
 
04:33:35.470 --> 04:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
brain disorders to live full inclusive
 
04:33:37.709 --> 04:33:37.719 align:start position:0%
and productive lives you're going to
 
04:33:40.429 --> 04:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
hear very compelling testimony today
 
04:33:42.750 --> 04:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
okay and I could give you
 
04:33:44.510 --> 04:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
similar compelling testimony about the
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
impact of ABA that it had on my son and
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
my life okay I can also talk about
 
04:33:53.470 --> 04:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
research that has been done that says
 
04:33:56.310 --> 04:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
how effective uh ABA is for people with
 
04:34:00.390 --> 04:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
Down Syndrome okay so NIH NIH studies
 
04:34:03.390 --> 04:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed um uh research that
 
04:34:06.750 --> 04:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
demonstrates ABA is very very compelling
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
and and and effective treatment for
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
people with Down Syndrome but I'm not
 
04:34:12.310 --> 04:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
going to do that okay well maybe I just
 
04:34:13.869 --> 04:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
did but I'm not going to do that I'm
 
04:34:15.869 --> 04:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
going to talk about why this is a
 
04:34:18.510 --> 04:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible thing to do in
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we have House Bill 1084
 
04:34:22.590 --> 04:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
617 okay these bills have been in the
 
04:34:27.150 --> 04:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts legislature for a while
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
and they're very similar to what we're
 
04:34:32.070 --> 04:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
asking for today and the general
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts General law requires an
 
04:34:36.670 --> 04:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
estimate of a Bill's fiscal impact as
 
04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
well as a review of the efficacy of the
 
04:34:41.109 --> 04:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
therapy okay so Massachusetts has done
 
04:34:43.310 --> 04:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
this already and they they contracted
 
04:34:45.429 --> 04:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
with Barry Dunn a National Services form
 
04:34:48.269 --> 04:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
firm to do this study and I'm going to
 
04:34:51.429 --> 04:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
just point out one they support the
 
04:34:53.949 --> 04:34:53.959 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the therapy okay so it is it
 
04:34:56.029 --> 04:34:56.039 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable and very good therapy
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
for people with Down syndrome and you'll
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
hear more about how it helps people but
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing in the barry dun report
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm the one that came up with the 20
 
04:35:05.310 --> 04:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
cents all right so the Barry dun report
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
said the additional cost per member
 
04:35:11.830 --> 04:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
would be between 0.10
 
04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
0.0025% and they put a dollar figure on
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
that and if you add if you multiply that
 
04:35:23.789 --> 04:35:23.799 align:start position:0%
out it it adds up to about 18 cents per
 
04:35:26.830 --> 04:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
member per year in the worst case okay
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
so it's not a lot of money so what does
 
04:35:30.429 --> 04:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
18 cents give give you right what's the
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
return on investment of 18 cents for a
 
04:35:35.070 --> 04:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
single individual it can save tens of
 
04:35:36.910 --> 04:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars in medical costs
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
due to accidents caused by maladaptive
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
behaviors you can also argue that it can
 
04:35:44.189 --> 04:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
be a life saving therapy it can increase
 
04:35:46.429 --> 04:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
in individual's in Independence and
 
04:35:48.310 --> 04:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost of care over their
 
04:35:50.830 --> 04:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
entire lifetime okay they don't need a
 
04:35:53.070 --> 04:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
care provider to help them through this
 
04:35:55.629 --> 04:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
this can help really improve behaviors
 
04:35:57.310 --> 04:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
and reduce the cost of care over their
 
04:36:01.510 --> 04:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
life um in school children okay it can
 
04:36:04.629 --> 04:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
enable a a child to be in a inclusive
 
04:36:07.150 --> 04:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
environment included in the classroom
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
resulting in a reduction in the cost of
 
04:36:10.830 --> 04:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
supports needed for them in in the
 
04:36:13.070 --> 04:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
classroom it can enable the individual
 
04:36:15.070 --> 04:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
to get a job it can enable the
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
individual's families to go back to work
 
04:36:19.709 --> 04:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
okay so this is what we're we're looking
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
at right for 18 cents per member per
 
04:36:24.590 --> 04:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
year we're looking at this entire
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
benefit on society so that I think the
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
sooner we support SP sp353 the sooner
 
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
our state will benefit so thank you for
 
04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
for considering my testimony please
 
04:36:36.109 --> 04:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
support SP
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
sp353 uh it'll help families obtain
 
04:36:40.510 --> 04:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for ABA for their
 
04:36:42.510 --> 04:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
loved ones with down Sy
 
04:36:43.949 --> 04:36:43.959 align:start position:0%
and it not only makes sense from
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
personal standpoint but it's also the
 
04:36:48.109 --> 04:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible thing to do for our
 
04:36:49.990 --> 04:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful State of New Hampshire thank
 
04:36:53.629 --> 04:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
you so uh before I take a question I you
 
04:36:55.109 --> 04:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
say this has been in front of the
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts legislature for a couple
 
04:36:58.990 --> 04:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
of years yeah what what happens is they
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
somebody brought a bill forward and
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts General Law requires a
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
study to be done it took it took time
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
for that study to be put in place when
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
did that study get done it was done in
 
04:37:08.561 --> 04:37:09.670 align:start position:0%
did that study get done it was done in
August

04:37:09.670 --> 04:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
August
 
04:37:12.189 --> 04:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
2023 okay so the bills are in the final
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
throws of being approved in
 
04:37:15.189 --> 04:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts okay that's why I was
 
04:37:16.670 --> 04:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
trying to figure this out we we have a
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
similar statute that we can do a
 
04:37:20.990 --> 04:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
financial analysis okay so okay
 
04:37:22.949 --> 04:37:22.959 align:start position:0%
representative burrow thanks for taking
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
my question I just want to confirm that
 
04:37:27.070 --> 04:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
you're saying that this bill would also
 
04:37:31.109 --> 04:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
impact adults with Down Syndrome PTSD
 
04:37:38.429 --> 04:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
PTSD okay I don't know if I don't know
 
04:37:43.349 --> 04:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
what's going on over so in the in the
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
existing law right it says chronic PTSD
 
04:37:47.590 --> 04:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
but that's not an addition from this
 
04:37:49.310 --> 04:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
bill this bill is just really adding
 
04:37:51.949 --> 04:37:51.959 align:start position:0%
correct that's already in the
 
04:37:54.990 --> 04:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
statute I wasn't but exactly you what
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
she she was asking is thank you I
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
thought I was going nuts so the the the
 
04:38:04.390 --> 04:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
therapy in The Spill would also impact
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
adult adults with it could potentially
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
potentially I mean t typically what you
 
04:38:10.551 --> 04:38:10.561 align:start position:0%
would see is early intervention and
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
inhome supports
 
04:38:14.349 --> 04:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh those those Medicaid uh thing people
 
04:38:16.670 --> 04:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
on those waivers they cannot get the
 
04:38:18.349 --> 04:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
coverage through Medicaid and so what
 
04:38:19.869 --> 04:38:19.879 align:start position:0%
they would do is go to their private
 
04:38:22.470 --> 04:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
private insurance company for this
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
coverage and we're seeing people denied
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
right right now just a follow because
 
04:38:29.230 --> 04:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
I'm suppos trying to understand I'm I'm
 
04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about a friend who has an
 
04:38:33.510 --> 04:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
adult child with autism and uh I worry
 
04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
about what's going to happen to him when
 
04:38:37.510 --> 04:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
she's no longer around so he's I think
 
04:38:40.109 --> 04:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
he's 27 now so he would still be able to
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
get services through this is it would be
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
if you approve this bill and and it goes
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
through it broadens insurance coverage
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
for people with Down Syndrome okay so
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
anybody right perfect okay thank you so
 
04:38:56.390 --> 04:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
much and you mentioned you have a son
 
04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
yourself I have a son who's 25 years old
 
04:39:02.590 --> 04:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
we uh saw him go through ABA okay he has
 
04:39:06.109 --> 04:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
autism okay and uh I I just how do I put
 
04:39:08.830 --> 04:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
this imagine that you're you're in pain
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
or something's really really bothering
 
04:39:12.789 --> 04:39:12.799 align:start position:0%
you and you can't communicate it you
 
04:39:15.310 --> 04:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
have no way of expressing that how do
 
04:39:17.310 --> 04:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
you how would you behave right you you
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
can do things in a very unpredictable
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
way you could do self harm you could run
 
04:39:25.070 --> 04:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
out into the street or whatever and what
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
ABA helped my son do right with that
 
04:39:30.629 --> 04:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
type of thing is be able to communicate
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
and that just that ability to be able to
 
04:39:36.310 --> 04:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
express something sure diffuses a lot of
 
04:39:36.320 --> 04:39:37.390 align:start position:0%
express something sure diffuses a lot of
the

04:39:37.390 --> 04:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
stress so does you still use the service
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
or that
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
he got he got cured from that that issue
 
04:39:49.550 --> 04:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
somehow it's not a lifelong therapy no I
 
04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
mean I I would think that that's where
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
she was going with the question which is
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
worrying that it could be something that
 
04:39:59.070 --> 04:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
would be unending I I don't I don't
 
04:40:02.070 --> 04:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
believe it's unending I mean um but when
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
we talk about adults there may be people
 
04:40:06.430 --> 04:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
that have been denied insurance coverage
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
but but it could be applicable for them
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
right so is any you said massachus has
 
04:40:14.670 --> 04:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
anybody talked about um how long you
 
04:40:17.910 --> 04:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
would have it or you Ser for instance um
 
04:40:19.510 --> 04:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
over the years one of our big issues
 
04:40:21.550 --> 04:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
with mental health and we actually had
 
04:40:24.070 --> 04:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
limits to how many visits you can get
 
04:40:25.948 --> 04:40:25.958 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of what was medically
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
necessary so has any state ever done
 
04:40:30.670 --> 04:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
that with this autism subject I don't
 
04:40:32.270 --> 04:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
know about limit limiting the therapy I
 
04:40:33.670 --> 04:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
mean there's only so many so many hours
 
04:40:37.150 --> 04:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
in a week but um I think we're talking
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
about lifetime yeah I'm trying to think
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.510 --> 04:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
on thank you a Aba for him was uh in his
 
04:40:52.430 --> 04:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
school years and then when he
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
transitioned to adulthood uh we didn't
 
04:40:57.310 --> 04:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
see the need to continue the therapy
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay so and you were talking about how
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
this therapy has been proven to be
 
04:41:03.708 --> 04:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
effective and has you know has um
 
04:41:05.470 --> 04:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
clinically based you know tests and
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
showing that it really helped is there
 
04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
any settings on how long something this
 
04:41:12.310 --> 04:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
care can be offered offered or how long
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
it should be offered or or any you know
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
terms of limits I guess that you in
 
04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
terms of getting to this question you
 
04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
mean in your mind what why would you
 
04:41:22.030 --> 04:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
want to set any limits but that when it
 
04:41:24.270 --> 04:41:24.280 align:start position:0%
comes to health insurance one of the
 
04:41:26.350 --> 04:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
things that it's always an issue is that
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
we the idea is to get you cured you know
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
get you healthy and then then you don't
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
need it anymore so what is in terms of
 
04:41:36.628 --> 04:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
to me I mean I I guess it's my own
 
04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
Nativity but but a Down syndrome person
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
is is down forever so how in terms of
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to just focus in like mental
 
04:41:45.750 --> 04:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
health that we're going to focus in on
 
04:41:49.150 --> 04:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
certain behavior and address that
 
04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
behavior and then once that behavior has
 
04:41:54.628 --> 04:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
been uh I don't know if it's been cured
 
04:41:57.430 --> 04:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
but it's remediated then then
 
04:41:59.788 --> 04:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
theoretically the coverage could be over
 
04:42:01.590 --> 04:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I I can't speak in general terms on
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
this Amy would be the right person to
 
04:42:06.910 --> 04:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
ask about this um I can say for my son
 
04:42:09.070 --> 04:42:09.080 align:start position:0%
he has autism for his entire life okay
 
04:42:13.310 --> 04:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
he's not cured um and we saw that uh ABA
 
04:42:15.910 --> 04:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
was very helpful and you reach a point
 
04:42:17.910 --> 04:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
where you say it's it's it's run its
 
04:42:22.830 --> 04:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
course right great thank you okay any
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
other questions yes question I had I
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
worked in the school district for a
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
number of years working with Spectrum
 
04:42:30.628 --> 04:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
disordered children and I was wondering
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of times what we would have to do
 
04:42:33.628 --> 04:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
is is particularly if we were working
 
04:42:36.430 --> 04:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
under a counselor um that we would be
 
04:42:37.868 --> 04:42:37.878 align:start position:0%
able to bill for our hours would this
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
allow School District to build for hours
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
when they were you doing certain um
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
Counseling Services with their children
 
04:42:50.110 --> 04:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
so may I ask any questions does do
 
04:42:53.230 --> 04:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
school districts for Direct Services yes
 
04:42:55.550 --> 04:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
you can Med when a bcba provides a
 
04:42:55.560 --> 04:42:56.990 align:start position:0%
you can Med when a bcba provides a
direct

04:42:56.990 --> 04:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
direct
 
04:42:59.708 --> 04:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
service but not private not private yeah
 
04:43:01.350 --> 04:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
not private we wouldn't be able to
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
private okay
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank great thank you very much thank
 
04:43:08.030 --> 04:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
you very much okay um I have a bunch of
 
04:43:09.788 --> 04:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
cards here people want to want to speak
 
04:43:12.910 --> 04:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
for the bill so but before I do that
 
04:43:14.750 --> 04:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
we'll just have someone who is actually
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the
 
04:43:17.600 --> 04:43:19.510 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the
bill

04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:43:29.230 --> 04:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:31.868 --> 04:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
there so what is our cautionary tale
 
04:43:35.070 --> 04:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
here yes good afternoon um Mr chairman
 
04:43:36.150 --> 04:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
04:43:37.910 --> 04:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
record my name is Heidi croll I work at
 
04:43:39.750 --> 04:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
Gallagher Calahan and Garrell and I'm
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
here today representing a hip which is
 
04:43:43.750 --> 04:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance plans um so
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
we just wanted to flag um a couple of
 
04:43:49.708 --> 04:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
things with this bill um one is uh the
 
04:43:51.948 --> 04:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
effective date so the effective date um
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
is upon passage usually with mandates we
 
04:43:56.750 --> 04:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
have them be effective the first of the
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
year to sync up with the plan year um so
 
04:44:02.550 --> 04:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's one of our concerns um another
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
concern we have is that um when you look
 
04:44:07.230 --> 04:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
at this bill in terms of um I'm looking
 
04:44:12.110 --> 04:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
at line 13 repeal um it's um requesting
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
to repeal RSA 417 E2 Roman 3 relative to
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
coverage limits however that um that
 
04:44:24.070 --> 04:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
section was actually repealed already in
 
04:44:28.150 --> 04:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
um 2022 by
 
04:44:33.830 --> 04:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
sb373 um so now um what this bill would
 
04:44:33.840 --> 04:44:35.350 align:start position:0%
sb373 um so now um what this bill would
repeal

04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
04:44:35.360 --> 04:44:38.470 align:start position:0%
repeal
is

04:44:38.470 --> 04:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
um a section that currently reads as
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
follow follows and I don't think this is
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
the intent of the advocates for this
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
bill um they would now be repealing a
 
04:44:48.550 --> 04:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
section that reads nothing in this
 
04:44:50.670 --> 04:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
section shall be construed to affect any
 
04:44:52.470 --> 04:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
obligation by a school district or the
 
04:44:54.270 --> 04:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to provide
 
04:44:56.030 --> 04:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
services to an individual under an
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
individualized family service plan for
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
an individualized education program as
 
04:45:02.350 --> 04:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
required under the federal individuals
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
with disabilities Education Act the
 
04:45:05.590 --> 04:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
state children's health insurance
 
04:45:08.470 --> 04:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
program um Etc I don't think that The
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
Advocates um really want to be repealing
 
04:45:15.150 --> 04:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
um that provision of law
 
04:45:19.390 --> 04:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
um the uh as I said the provision that
 
04:45:23.590 --> 04:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
used to be Roman 3 um relative to limits
 
04:45:26.350 --> 04:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
has already been repealed so whoever
 
04:45:28.430 --> 04:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
drafted this piece of legislation I
 
04:45:30.590 --> 04:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
think looked at an old version of the
 
04:45:30.600 --> 04:45:32.350 align:start position:0%
think looked at an old version of the
statute

04:45:32.350 --> 04:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:45:32.360 --> 04:45:34.150 align:start position:0%
statute
so

04:45:34.150 --> 04:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
um two other points I was just going to
 
04:45:39.830 --> 04:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
make um one um this again only applies
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
to the fully insured Market um not the
 
04:45:45.550 --> 04:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
self-funded market um it would apply to
 
04:45:47.470 --> 04:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
both the individual and the employer
 
04:45:49.830 --> 04:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
groups but again only fully insured
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
which is approximately 28% of the market
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
so this would not apply to self-funded
 
04:46:00.750 --> 04:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
plans which um uh make up about 34% of
 
04:46:02.830 --> 04:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
the market so I think people's
 
04:46:05.670 --> 04:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
expectations just need to be um set
 
04:46:07.948 --> 04:46:07.958 align:start position:0%
appropriately that um there will still
 
04:46:11.550 --> 04:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
be um uh people who are under those
 
04:46:13.788 --> 04:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
plans who are not going to have coverage
 
04:46:17.190 --> 04:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
under this particular statute um and the
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
final thing I was going to say um you
 
04:46:21.670 --> 04:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
know ultimately this is a legislative
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
decision um at least one of the plans
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
provided got uh information to me that
 
04:46:29.470 --> 04:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
um that they have found that there is
 
04:46:31.470 --> 04:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
not enough clinical evidence to show
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
that ABA is an effective treatment for
 
04:46:36.350 --> 04:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
individuals with Down Syndrome um their
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
BH team only found two studies that
 
04:46:42.788 --> 04:46:42.798 align:start position:0%
support that um and requiring um
 
04:46:44.788 --> 04:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
coverage of ABA for individuals with
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
Down Syndrome could also exacerbate the
 
04:46:52.510 --> 04:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
existing access um issues to Aba um due
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
to as you heard earlier provider
 
04:46:56.350 --> 04:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
shortages so if we're um it's just
 
04:46:57.708 --> 04:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
something to be aware of if you're
 
04:47:00.430 --> 04:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
expanding the population um who is
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for ABA Services um uh again it
 
04:47:08.190 --> 04:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
you know I guess maybe there's um not
 
04:47:10.390 --> 04:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
the substantial body of clinical
 
04:47:13.470 --> 04:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
evidence that I guess there is for um
 
04:47:16.628 --> 04:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
the autis autism spectrum disorder um
 
04:47:18.910 --> 04:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
and just making folks aware that it
 
04:47:21.430 --> 04:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
could um make access even more
 
04:47:23.830 --> 04:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
challenging because you'd be adding more
 
04:47:26.230 --> 04:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
people eligible without increasing the
 
04:47:29.868 --> 04:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
provider um supply side if you
 
04:47:33.310 --> 04:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
will Network adequacy
 
04:47:35.948 --> 04:47:35.958 align:start position:0%
yes well yeah just the fact that the
 
04:47:37.470 --> 04:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
providers are just not there in the
 
04:47:38.868 --> 04:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
state but that kind of begs the question
 
04:47:40.470 --> 04:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
is this a new mandate and so therefore
 
04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
the state has to pay for it when it
 
04:47:44.948 --> 04:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
comes to the
 
04:47:46.708 --> 04:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
marketplace I guess I look at the
 
04:47:48.390 --> 04:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
insurance department that no I don't
 
04:47:50.270 --> 04:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
have an answer because just expanding a
 
04:47:51.948 --> 04:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
law that already on the
 
04:47:51.958 --> 04:47:56.628 align:start position:0%
law that already on the
books

04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay right there already bet it's
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
already required right okay just it just
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
because we're
 
04:48:07.150 --> 04:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
clarifying adding it's not adding a new
 
04:48:08.910 --> 04:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
category it's it's a statute that are
 
04:48:11.948 --> 04:48:11.958 align:start position:0%
exists okay all right cool
 
04:48:15.270 --> 04:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
um any questions I get so when this
 
04:48:17.310 --> 04:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
thing got
 
04:48:20.628 --> 04:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
repealed s we do we do that we did that
 
04:48:24.430 --> 04:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
repeal apparently it's it was a um well
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
actually um I'm
 
04:48:31.150 --> 04:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
looking um least in the Senate it was
 
04:48:33.948 --> 04:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services committee
 
04:48:35.350 --> 04:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
um it was a Senate bill it was Senate
 
04:48:35.360 --> 04:48:36.390 align:start position:0%
um it was a Senate bill it was Senate
Bill

04:48:36.390 --> 04:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
373 um it was approved on July 25th of
 
04:48:42.510 --> 04:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
202 2 and it became effective on
 
04:48:47.110 --> 04:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
2022 so okay so I think whoever drafted
 
04:48:52.470 --> 04:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
the bill the limits is really what we're
 
04:48:54.628 --> 04:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
talking about in terms of a has age
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
limits and it has dollar amounts and had
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
some some guard rails as you might call
 
04:49:05.150 --> 04:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
them okay yes representative Herbert um
 
04:49:07.990 --> 04:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear that gentleman's remark as
 
04:49:12.190 --> 04:49:12.200 align:start position:0%
to the the additional
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll invite the insurance
 
04:49:15.990 --> 04:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
department to come up next here to
 
04:49:22.110 --> 04:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
you okay tag who wants to come up and
 
04:49:31.948 --> 04:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
pieces yeah
 
04:49:40.750 --> 04:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.670 --> 04:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
oh look what we have here I didn't see
 
04:49:49.030 --> 04:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:51.788 --> 04:49:51.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner I should have hit
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
better okay so we the two questions we
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
have obviously is uh that paragraph that
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
got repealed and and what was the basis
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
around feeling that we didn't need any
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
guard rails around that and does it
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
change now that we're adding Down
 
04:50:11.548 --> 04:50:11.558 align:start position:0%
syndrome to the list which which then we
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
just heard is that some insurance
 
04:50:16.910 --> 04:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
companies that the efficacy of care
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
coverage for Down syndrome is in
 
04:50:21.510 --> 04:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to start with the
 
04:50:25.310 --> 04:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
easy one which is the we brought a bill
 
04:50:29.150 --> 04:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
in 2022 to repeal the limits because the
 
04:50:32.110 --> 04:50:32.120 align:start position:0%
mental health parity act prohibited us
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
from having those limits okay so we were
 
04:50:36.548 --> 04:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
unable to enforce those
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
limits um even with that book that law
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
on the books so we came to the
 
04:50:44.628 --> 04:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
legislature and said we need to remove
 
04:50:48.310 --> 04:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
it so that was done quickly and that
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
would apply we can't add them back the
 
04:50:52.788 --> 04:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
same issue applies we have mental health
 
04:50:58.390 --> 04:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
generally so that is a I I would view
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
that as a technical flaw in the bill
 
04:51:05.788 --> 04:51:05.798 align:start position:0%
that should be I think it should be
 
04:51:08.708 --> 04:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
removed or um just will they just be
 
04:51:10.750 --> 04:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
removed line three yes there's no need
 
04:51:12.310 --> 04:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
to repeal that just remove line three
 
04:51:13.990 --> 04:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
correct and then change the effective
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
dat to U January
 
04:51:20.190 --> 04:51:20.200 align:start position:0%
1st okay so those are good but how about
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
this efficacy
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
issue well I mean that's obviously
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
something that we don't weigh in on
 
04:51:27.470 --> 04:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
those are for doctors and medical
 
04:51:28.708 --> 04:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
professionals to make those
 
04:51:31.590 --> 04:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
determinations and ultimately it's well
 
04:51:33.510 --> 04:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's medical directors of the you might
 
04:51:35.310 --> 04:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
want to pull the mic a little bit closer
 
04:51:37.190 --> 04:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
but that's up to the medical director of
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
the health insurance company that's
 
04:51:41.830 --> 04:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
right that's it it is a determination
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
for the medical director of the carrier
 
04:51:45.788 --> 04:51:45.798 align:start position:0%
to get together with the physician that
 
04:51:47.788 --> 04:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
is treating the patient and come to an
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
agreement on what the most
 
04:51:53.470 --> 04:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate type of care or treatment is
 
04:51:54.590 --> 04:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's not something that we get
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
involved with that's a medical necessity
 
04:51:58.510 --> 04:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
determination we're not qualified to
 
04:52:00.390 --> 04:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
weigh in on those matters well let's say
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
if there's a disagreement then it would
 
04:52:04.750 --> 04:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
go to the grievance ultimately it could
 
04:52:06.548 --> 04:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
go to an external review that's right
 
04:52:09.070 --> 04:52:09.080 align:start position:0%
external review to decide whether the
 
04:52:10.470 --> 04:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
the protocol was appropriate or not

parent and advocate for children

including those with Down Syndrome I'm
 
04:53:30.628 --> 04:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
here to wholeheartedly support SB 353 a
 
04:53:32.150 --> 04:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill that aims to expand insurance
 
04:53:35.190 --> 04:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
coverage for ABA for those with Down
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
Syndrome I have experienced F firsthand
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
the transformation and power of ABA the
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
therapy in the lives of children with
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
Down Syndrome thanks to the targeted
 
04:53:46.390 --> 04:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
interventions provided by ABA therapists
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
my 7-year-old son Asher is good friends
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
with Xander who is a six-year-old boy
 
04:53:52.708 --> 04:53:52.718 align:start position:0%
with Down Syndrome since starting ABA
 
04:53:54.510 --> 04:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
I've seen huge changes in Xander's
 
04:53:56.750 --> 04:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
communication with my son and others and
 
04:53:58.708 --> 04:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
his friend group his ability to
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
understand social situations and his
 
04:54:02.430 --> 04:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
ability to interact in group situations
 
04:54:03.910 --> 04:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
such as kicking the soccer ball in an
 
04:54:05.590 --> 04:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
age appropriate way which is something
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
they enjoy doing together one of the
 
04:54:09.788 --> 04:54:09.798 align:start position:0%
most significant challenges we face is
 
04:54:11.788 --> 04:54:11.798 align:start position:0%
the current qualification criteria for
 
04:54:14.110 --> 04:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
ABA Services which often rely on a
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
diagnosis based approach while this
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
approach is suitable for many it does
 
04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
not always consider the individual needs
 
04:54:22.030 --> 04:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
of children with Down Syndrome last
 
04:54:24.350 --> 04:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
summer my oldest son JJ was diagnosed
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
with level one autism and ADHD his
 
04:54:28.628 --> 04:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
neuropsychologist suggested several
 
04:54:31.150 --> 04:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
supports including OT and counseling but
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
they did not suggest ABA based on his
 
04:54:34.868 --> 04:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
individual needs even though he
 
04:54:37.708 --> 04:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
qualifies based on his diagnosis she did
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
not find it necessary children with Down
 
04:54:41.390 --> 04:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
Syndrome can have complex and diverse
 
04:54:43.390 --> 04:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
needs that may exceed those of children
 
04:54:45.470 --> 04:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
with certain categories of autism it's
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
essential that we adopt a needs-based
 
04:54:48.548 --> 04:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
approach for qualifications for ABA
 
04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
Services ensuring that all children can
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
benefit from the therapy and have access
 
04:54:53.948 --> 04:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
to it and I know money has obviously
 
04:54:56.030 --> 04:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
been a big part of the conversation so I
 
04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
know there's others like me who aren't
 
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
having access to this bill even though
 
04:55:02.590 --> 04:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
they could so not all of us are using
 
04:55:03.670 --> 04:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
that therapy so hopefully that would
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
make room for others that need it um so
 
04:55:09.110 --> 04:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support sp353 and help
 
04:55:10.910 --> 04:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
make ABA therapy more more accessible to
 
04:55:12.750 --> 04:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
individuals with Down Syndrome by doing
 
04:55:14.110 --> 04:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
so we can make a meaningful difference
 
04:55:16.190 --> 04:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
in the lives of these families and the
 
04:55:17.910 --> 04:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
individuals thanks thank you for
 
04:55:19.708 --> 04:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
considering that's excellent thank you
 
04:55:21.030 --> 04:55:21.040 align:start position:0%

Watson hi my name is June and I'm no
 
04:57:07.548 --> 04:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
Xander since the day who was born Xander
 
04:57:09.788 --> 04:57:09.798 align:start position:0%
is really silly and fun to be around I
 
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
like to jump on the trampoline with him
 
04:57:13.590 --> 04:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
and catch frogs in the woods we used to
 
04:57:15.670 --> 04:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
have to ask Megan what Xander was trying
 
04:57:17.868 --> 04:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
to say but now he can talk a lot more
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
and we know what he is saying without
 
04:57:21.310 --> 04:57:21.320 align:start position:0%
him getting
 
04:57:23.628 --> 04:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
frustrated my brother who is Xander's
 
04:57:25.590 --> 04:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
age and I get to do a lot of stuff by
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves but Xander usually needs a
 
04:57:29.230 --> 04:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
grown up with him it would be really
 
04:57:30.910 --> 04:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
great if he could learn to do more stuff
 
04:57:32.750 --> 04:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
that the rest of us can do and I think
 
04:57:35.310 --> 04:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
ABA therapy could help with
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
that excellent thank you very

is Kaylee cheslock and I live in Dover
 
04:58:16.708 --> 04:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm asking you to support SB 353 to
 
04:58:18.910 --> 04:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
broaden insurance cover coverage for ABA
 
04:58:21.230 --> 04:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
to include people with Down Syndrome I'm
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill because I have the
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
privilege of knowing Xander Foster and
 
04:58:28.270 --> 04:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
um I I just have the desire to see him
 
04:58:30.788 --> 04:58:30.798 align:start position:0%
Thrive I've seen the benefits of ABA
 
04:58:32.670 --> 04:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
therapy in his life with the
 
04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
socialization and ability to stay safe
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I've been there in times when Xander
 
04:58:40.390 --> 04:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
has run away or done things that are
 
04:58:43.708 --> 04:58:43.718 align:start position:0%
scary and um I have seen that ABA
 
04:58:46.110 --> 04:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
therapy has helped him to stay safe and
 
04:58:48.110 --> 04:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
has reduced the risk of injury to him
 
04:58:50.310 --> 04:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
and those around him which I do believe
 
04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
I know that you're all considering costs
 
04:58:53.510 --> 04:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
and this will reduce medical costs in
 
04:58:55.470 --> 04:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
the long term just for the care that he
 
04:58:58.350 --> 04:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
needs um I have my two oldest children
 
04:59:00.110 --> 04:59:00.120 align:start position:0%

04:59:01.788 --> 04:59:01.798 align:start position:0%

she loves Xander and she loves when he
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
hugs her and says her name and ABA
 
04:59:17.470 --> 04:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
therapy has helped Xander to be able to
 
04:59:19.510 --> 04:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
say her name and understand what she's
 
04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%

04:59:54.070 --> 04:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.590 --> 04:59:56.600 align:start position:0%
do hi there for the record my name is
 
04:59:59.150 --> 04:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
Lisa Bodwin strategies for disability
 
05:00:02.350 --> 05:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
Equity I am a Disability Policy
 
05:00:04.910 --> 05:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
professional and I'm also the parent of
 
05:00:07.948 --> 05:00:07.958 align:start position:0%
a young man with Down Syndrome he is 28
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
and he lives on his own and he completed
 
05:00:13.070 --> 05:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
high school with a real high school
 
05:00:17.390 --> 05:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
diploma and ABA was one of the um
 
05:00:19.788 --> 05:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
therapies that he received as a very
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
young child um that our family had to
 
05:00:26.310 --> 05:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
privately pay for because we were denied
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
coverage so um just have a a couple of
 
05:00:34.548 --> 05:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
other small policy notes um just to
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
differentiate when children with IEPs
 
05:00:42.070 --> 05:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
who are in school who get ABA they're
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
getting it covered through Medicaid it's
 
05:00:46.510 --> 05:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid to school programs so this
 
05:00:51.230 --> 05:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
bill will not impact students in who are
 
05:00:54.830 --> 05:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
receiving services in their school
 
05:00:58.628 --> 05:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
buildings uh I also wanted to emphasize
 
05:01:02.030 --> 05:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
will Walker's Point the net benefits
 
05:01:04.670 --> 05:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
across the lifespan will specifically
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
serve the self-interest of the State of
 
05:01:10.390 --> 05:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because of if youngsters
 
05:01:12.548 --> 05:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
received ABA therapy they are better
 
05:01:16.788 --> 05:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
staged to have jobs as adults to be
 
05:01:19.708 --> 05:01:19.718 align:start position:0%
contributing civic-minded engaged
 
05:01:21.750 --> 05:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
citizens which is what we all want we
 
05:01:24.270 --> 05:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
want everyone to have an equal footing
 
05:01:26.310 --> 05:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
but most importantly to the state of New
 
05:01:28.430 --> 05:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire across the
 
05:01:31.350 --> 05:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
lifespan Medicaid long-term supports and
 
05:01:34.708 --> 05:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
services costs will deliver a will be
 
05:01:37.628 --> 05:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
lowered because if if
 
05:01:40.548 --> 05:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
individuals um have more
 
05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
Independence and
 
05:01:45.430 --> 05:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
self-reliance due to receiving the
 
05:01:47.590 --> 05:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
supports and services that they need to
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
be staged for success as adults that
 
05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
means fewer Medicaid dollars need to be
 
05:02:00.788 --> 05:02:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:03.548 --> 05:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
services and that's all I have this the
 
05:02:06.590 --> 05:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
the stories that um you are hearing are
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
compelling and um I hope you will
 
05:02:11.470 --> 05:02:11.480 align:start position:0%

you to support SB 353 to broaden
 
05:02:47.948 --> 05:02:47.958 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage for Applied
 
05:02:49.830 --> 05:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
behavioral analysis to include people
 
05:02:51.070 --> 05:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
with Down
 
05:02:53.628 --> 05:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
Syndrome I am a mom to Xander a
 
05:02:55.948 --> 05:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
six-year-old boy with Down syndrome and
 
05:02:57.868 --> 05:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
last summer we had the scare of Our
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
Lives when Xander loped from summer camp
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
and was gone for about an hour in an
 
05:03:05.150 --> 05:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
area surrounded by water later in the
 
05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
month he swallowed a number of
 
05:03:08.670 --> 05:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
acetaminophen tablets and had to be
 
05:03:11.750 --> 05:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
hospitalized and treated at Mass General
 
05:03:13.750 --> 05:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital we immediately started
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
researching behavioral interventions I'm
 
05:03:18.190 --> 05:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
a registered nurse by trade and so
 
05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practice is incredibly
 
05:03:22.990 --> 05:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
important to me during the research we
 
05:03:24.510 --> 05:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
came across evidence regarding the
 
05:03:26.430 --> 05:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of ABA with individuals
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
with Down syndrome and had multiple
 
05:03:31.470 --> 05:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
assessments done on Xander and the
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
providers who knew Xander best decided
 
05:03:35.788 --> 05:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
that the interventions offered by ABA
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:42.430 --> 05:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
ABA could address not only the major
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
safety concerns that we had but many of
 
05:03:46.110 --> 05:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
the personal hygiene and self-help
 
05:03:48.548 --> 05:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
skills that would help protect Xander's
 
05:03:52.030 --> 05:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
personhood his dignity and health every
 
05:03:54.910 --> 05:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
day when applying for a for coverage for
 
05:03:56.990 --> 05:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
the ABA assessment by our insurance it
 
05:03:58.708 --> 05:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
took over eight months to process
 
05:04:00.548 --> 05:04:00.558 align:start position:0%
because Xander didn't have an Autism
 
05:04:02.990 --> 05:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and believe me we tried that
 
05:04:04.990 --> 05:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
route we tried to get him an Autism
 
05:04:07.230 --> 05:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
diagnosis he doesn't have
 
05:04:11.150 --> 05:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
autism every neuros pych eval said no no
 
05:04:13.150 --> 05:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
shortly after beginning Services we
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
heard that our insurance again denied
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
coverage even though the assessment had
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
said that he could benefit from ABA
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
Services because he did not have an
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
Autism diagnosis despite research
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
medical necessity is deemed both by
 
05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
Xander's primary care doctor and an
 
05:04:30.510 --> 05:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
expert in the health care of individuals
 
05:04:33.230 --> 05:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
of with Down syndrome and documented
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
progress that these Services had been
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
effective these things didn't matter to
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
the insurance company because the only
 
05:04:41.030 --> 05:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
measure they relied on was the law
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
stating that he it only needed to be
 
05:04:46.110 --> 05:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
covered for individuals with autism
 
05:04:49.110 --> 05:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
Xander has continued AB therapy after
 
05:04:52.910 --> 05:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
many phone calls to senators and many
 
05:04:54.910 --> 05:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
hours on the phone with insurance
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
companies he's made strides in
 
05:04:58.750 --> 05:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
participating in safe and health
 
05:05:00.350 --> 05:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
promoting behaviors that will serve as
 
05:05:01.990 --> 05:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
prevention for major health problems
 
05:05:04.510 --> 05:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
later in life he's acquiring skills and
 
05:05:06.070 --> 05:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
Independence through ABA which will
 
05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
serve to reduce the cost burden for
 
05:05:10.390 --> 05:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
caring for him in the future this is the
 
05:05:12.910 --> 05:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
case for many individuals like him
 
05:05:14.510 --> 05:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
Xander has Medicaid and his
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
acetaminophen overdose alone cost tens
 
05:05:19.590 --> 05:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
of thousands of dollars prior to
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
beginning ABA therapy Xander was unable
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
to tolerate toothbrushing at all he had
 
05:05:26.910 --> 05:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
to undergo anesthesia for a cleaning in
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
a cavity fill that cost over $10,000
 
05:05:33.150 --> 05:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
again C covered by Medicaid but after
 
05:05:35.070 --> 05:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
repeated exposure and utilizing expert
 
05:05:36.750 --> 05:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
shaping skills for his negative
 
05:05:39.750 --> 05:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
behaviors he can brush his own teeth and
 
05:05:42.510 --> 05:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
tolerate toothbrushing by his
 
05:05:45.270 --> 05:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
parents he hasn't have a had a cavity
 
05:05:48.070 --> 05:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
since Medicaid also currently pays for
 
05:05:49.948 --> 05:05:49.958 align:start position:0%
Xander's incontinence supplies but with
 
05:05:52.750 --> 05:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
ABA he has demonstrated moderate success
 
05:05:55.390 --> 05:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
another cost that which predicts another
 
05:05:56.830 --> 05:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
cost that will be relieved with
 
05:05:56.840 --> 05:05:57.788 align:start position:0%
cost that will be relieved with
continued

05:05:57.788 --> 05:05:57.798 align:start position:0%
continued
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
Ava thinking back to the beginning of my
 
05:06:01.868 --> 05:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
testimony when I shared about Alexander
 
05:06:03.990 --> 05:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
loping in the worst case scenario had
 
05:06:05.470 --> 05:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
Xander been hurt or drowned there would
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
have been enormous Financial cost to the
 
05:06:09.670 --> 05:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
emergency services not to mention the
 
05:06:11.628 --> 05:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
lasting financial and emotional cost
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
that would have been born to the town
 
05:06:16.110 --> 05:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
and organizations involved prior to Aba
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
we were avoiding and narrowly missing
 
05:06:21.110 --> 05:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
situations like this every single day
 
05:06:23.548 --> 05:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
now Xander stops when he's told to and
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
understands the need to stay with adults
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
in unsafe situations as a mother seeing
 
05:06:30.070 --> 05:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
Xander be more successful in interacting
 
05:06:31.470 --> 05:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
with his peer Group which you heard
 
05:06:34.030 --> 05:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
about accessing education with the tools
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
that he's built through ABA therapy he
 
05:06:37.628 --> 05:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even stay in the classroom
 
05:06:40.350 --> 05:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
before ABA I'm grateful for the ways
 
05:06:41.868 --> 05:06:41.878 align:start position:0%
that this has created systems in our
 
05:06:43.590 --> 05:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
home that help us navigate caring for
 
05:06:45.510 --> 05:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
Xander in ways that preserve his safety
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
personhood dignity and health for
 
05:06:50.590 --> 05:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
reference I've included testimonies for
 
05:06:53.590 --> 05:06:53.600 align:start position:0%

from my constituents about their

challenges with prior
 
05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
authorization while prior authorization
 
05:13:55.350 --> 05:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
can help ensure Medical Care is
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
necessary and appropriate it can also be
 
05:14:01.590 --> 05:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
an obstacle to necessary patient care
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
when providers must navigate complex and
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
widely varying payer requirements or
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
face very long Waits for prior
 
05:14:13.030 --> 05:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
authorization decisions this bill will
 
05:14:16.070 --> 05:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
remove barriers to Patient Care by
 
05:14:18.708 --> 05:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
streamlining prior authorization
 
05:14:22.030 --> 05:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
requirements on insurers websites the
 
05:14:24.868 --> 05:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
bill codifies into New Hampshire statue
 
05:14:27.670 --> 05:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
a clear peer-to-peer process for
 
05:14:30.510 --> 05:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
providers to engage with a clinical peer
 
05:14:32.590 --> 05:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
from their patients insurance carrier
 
05:14:35.628 --> 05:14:35.638 align:start position:0%
for a direct exchange on the basis of
 
05:14:38.590 --> 05:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
the prior authorization request this
 
05:14:42.070 --> 05:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill also requires carriers regulated by
 
05:14:43.470 --> 05:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
Insurance to report on prior
 
05:14:49.070 --> 05:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
authorization metrics in line with a new
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
federal rule from the centers for

direct response to concerns from my
 
05:15:01.948 --> 05:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
constituents too many Granite Staters
 
05:15:04.590 --> 05:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
are left in limbo waiting for approval
 
05:15:06.390 --> 05:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
from their insurance company to move
 
05:15:09.270 --> 05:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
forward with important Medical Care this
 
05:15:12.030 --> 05:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
bill enacts a reasonable timeline for
 
05:15:14.750 --> 05:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
carriers to make a prior authorization
 
05:15:17.310 --> 05:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
determination in line with Federal
 
05:15:20.190 --> 05:15:20.200 align:start position:0%
timeline regulations this will allow the
 
05:15:22.670 --> 05:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Insurance to
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
enforce timely prior authorization
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking on the health insurance
 
05:15:30.750 --> 05:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
plans that it regulates this bill breaks
 
05:15:33.310 --> 05:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
down the barriers to make it much easier
 
05:15:36.548 --> 05:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
for doctors and nurses to provide care
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
that people really need to stay healthy
 
05:15:41.910 --> 05:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
finally although we have not had a
 
05:15:44.948 --> 05:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
specific study on the expected savings
 
05:15:48.270 --> 05:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
from this bill by enacting efficiencies
 
05:15:50.670 --> 05:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
and streamlined prior authorization
 
05:15:54.110 --> 05:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
process Senate Bill 561 should put
 
05:15:56.990 --> 05:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
downward pressure on insurance premiums
 
05:15:59.788 --> 05:15:59.798 align:start position:0%
and the cost to provide care in fact a
 
05:16:03.110 --> 05:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
recent rule from CMS that includes many
 
05:16:05.830 --> 05:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
of the same Provisions as in Senate Bill
 
05:16:09.030 --> 05:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
561 estimates the rule will result in in
 
05:16:12.390 --> 05:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
at least 16 billion in savings over 10
 
05:16:15.548 --> 05:16:15.558 align:start position:0%
years and a reduction in provider burden
 
05:16:19.070 --> 05:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
of at least 220 million hours over 10
 
05:16:19.080 --> 05:16:20.590 align:start position:0%
of at least 220 million hours over 10
years

05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
years

05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:00.030 --> 05:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
answer uh we do have a
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
question yesst Mr chair yes thank you um
 
05:17:06.948 --> 05:17:06.958 align:start position:0%
Senator I have a question about whether
 
05:17:10.350 --> 05:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
this goes beyond a doctor or a nurse
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
does it apply to people with physical
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
therapy or any other um uh person that
 
05:17:20.750 --> 05:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
administers uh Healthcare yes the it it
 
05:17:22.910 --> 05:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
will do that it will not um address
 
05:17:26.670 --> 05:17:26.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:31.030 --> 05:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
issue any other question representative
 
05:17:33.470 --> 05:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
Bros thanks for taking my
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
question excuse me as a wife of a former
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
emergency Doctor Who had to deal with
 
05:17:42.270 --> 05:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
this a lot um so I see the 72h hour uh
 
05:17:44.070 --> 05:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
has to be 72 hours in an urgent
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
situation what happens if they don't get
 
05:17:48.628 --> 05:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
that that authorization within the 72
 
05:17:52.190 --> 05:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
hours what happens um automatic approval
 
05:17:52.200 --> 05:17:55.788 align:start position:0%
hours what happens um automatic approval
oh

05:17:55.788 --> 05:17:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:58.750 --> 05:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
okay you have to be you have to have a
 
05:18:01.390 --> 05:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
response from the insurance carrier
 
05:18:03.510 --> 05:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
within seven days even if it's non-
 
05:18:05.868 --> 05:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
urgent if you don't have a response from
 
05:18:07.868 --> 05:18:07.878 align:start position:0%
the insurance carrier it would be
 
05:18:10.150 --> 05:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
automatic approval now a response does
 
05:18:13.110 --> 05:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
not mean that you know they may need
 
05:18:15.510 --> 05:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
more information and but you do have to
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
hear from the carrier within seven days
 
05:18:20.110 --> 05:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
full that's the biggest part of the bill
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
that was really important to me I had
 
05:18:25.110 --> 05:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
too many people where their health care
 
05:18:27.310 --> 05:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
was declining while they were waiting
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
the other really important part of this
 
05:18:32.830 --> 05:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
bill to me that I love is that it's
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer review so there won't be an
 
05:18:36.990 --> 05:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
instance now where maybe your
 
05:18:40.350 --> 05:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
cardiologist is talking to a podiatrist
 
05:18:43.030 --> 05:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
it will be peer-to-peer this is really
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
good for the State of New Hampshire and
 
05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
again the fact that the insurance
 
05:18:49.948 --> 05:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
department all the stakeholders the
 
05:18:53.670 --> 05:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers we worked we had at
 
05:18:56.590 --> 05:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
least six very long meetings over months
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
till we came to something we could all
 
05:19:01.150 --> 05:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
walk in and when we walked into um
 
05:19:03.150 --> 05:19:03.160 align:start position:0%
Senate Health and Human Services we
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:11.350 --> 05:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
right for the question I would follow up
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
and and again it may be in the bill it's
 
05:19:15.030 --> 05:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
just my memory just is not very good in
 
05:19:17.110 --> 05:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
terms of retaining all the information
 
05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
in here let's say you have an emergency
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
and you really need an answer for
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
something within an hour em emergency is
 
05:19:26.030 --> 05:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
if you deem it as emergency it goes
 
05:19:29.628 --> 05:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
through there's no issue okay emergency
 
05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
is an emergency okay it's more if I'll
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
give you an example if I may your doctor
 
05:19:37.910 --> 05:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
thinks maybe you need an MRI of your
 
05:19:40.430 --> 05:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
brain y doesn't think it's urgent but
 
05:19:44.070 --> 05:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
really you need it this will allow or
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
enable the insurance carries to respond
 
05:19:48.830 --> 05:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
within s days instead of you know months
 
05:19:51.788 --> 05:19:51.798 align:start position:0%
long down the road but an emergency is
 
05:19:53.830 --> 05:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
no issue okay thank
 
05:19:56.910 --> 05:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
you represent Ammon thank you Mr chair
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking our
 
05:20:00.670 --> 05:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
questions um I have a question about the
 
05:20:02.990 --> 05:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer review process if you could
 
05:20:05.910 --> 05:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
just uh elaborate on how that would work
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
well when the doctor goes to put in the
 
05:20:11.350 --> 05:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
request for the prior
 
05:20:14.070 --> 05:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
authorization that request can include a
 
05:20:17.548 --> 05:20:17.558 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer review so that the person
 
05:20:20.788 --> 05:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
on the other end of the um in the other
 
05:20:22.430 --> 05:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
end of deciding on the prior
 
05:20:24.830 --> 05:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
authorization has the knowledge about
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:30.750 --> 05:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
question it means the person they're
 
05:20:33.470 --> 05:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
talking to is knows what they're talking
 
05:20:36.590 --> 05:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
about is the is the thank position for
 
05:20:39.150 --> 05:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
that that patient well there in the same
 
05:20:42.750 --> 05:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
field okay if that's help helps in the
 
05:20:45.310 --> 05:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
old days some of the complaints uh I
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
remember way back when we did 7-Eleven
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
was that that uh some it wasn't even a
 
05:20:51.990 --> 05:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
medical director it was sometimes it was
 
05:20:54.310 --> 05:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
a nurse who was getting who worked for
 
05:20:57.070 --> 05:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
the insurance to company and or just an
 
05:21:00.030 --> 05:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
employee who then just looks up and and
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
and takes the information and deci made
 
05:21:04.070 --> 05:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
that determination so what they're
 
05:21:06.430 --> 05:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
saying is you want someone who actually
 
05:21:07.948 --> 05:21:07.958 align:start position:0%
is in the field knows what they're
 
05:21:09.270 --> 05:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:21:11.070 --> 05:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
it's in the best interest of the patient
 
05:21:13.670 --> 05:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
which is what we what this bill will
 
05:21:13.680 --> 05:21:15.070 align:start position:0%
which is what we what this bill will
actually

05:21:15.070 --> 05:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:21:18.190 --> 05:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
do there fair enough thank you very much
 
05:21:20.270 --> 05:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
time okay uh chair will call up the
 
05:21:34.470 --> 05:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:36.750 --> 05:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
committee my name is still DJ beton
 
05:21:40.110 --> 05:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
court and I still have the pleasure of
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
serving as the commissioner of the New
 
05:21:43.708 --> 05:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department want to
 
05:21:45.470 --> 05:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
just emphasize two things that Senator
 
05:21:47.948 --> 05:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
rardy mentioned first is this was a
 
05:21:50.670 --> 05:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful example of stakeholders coming
 
05:21:52.708 --> 05:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
together and working productively and
 
05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to reach an end product
 
05:21:57.708 --> 05:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
that all sides are an agreement is a
 
05:22:00.350 --> 05:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
good product and so I do want to thank
 
05:22:02.310 --> 05:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
as the senator did everybody who came
 
05:22:05.350 --> 05:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
together to bring this important reform
 
05:22:07.990 --> 05:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
that is before you today it is important
 
05:22:09.190 --> 05:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
to remember remember that prior
 
05:22:12.150 --> 05:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
authorization while a paino for a lot of
 
05:22:15.270 --> 05:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
providers and patients is a key
 
05:22:18.030 --> 05:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
component of our managed care system and
 
05:22:20.030 --> 05:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
it is aimed to in the first instance
 
05:22:23.070 --> 05:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
control cost but more importantly it is
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
aimed at ensuring that the patient is
 
05:22:27.548 --> 05:22:27.558 align:start position:0%
getting the most appropriate care in the
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
most appropriate setting and so I know
 
05:22:34.030 --> 05:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
that there has been some movement uh
 
05:22:37.110 --> 05:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
some uh growing attitudes towards trying
 
05:22:40.470 --> 05:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
to vastly erode or outright eliminate
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
prior authorization I don't think that's
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
the way that we want to go what I do
 
05:22:48.590 --> 05:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
acknowledge however is that this is a
 
05:22:50.868 --> 05:22:50.878 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic and at times cumbersome
 
05:22:53.310 --> 05:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
system and when you have those types of
 
05:22:55.470 --> 05:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
systems you have to constantly be
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
challenging yourself to make the system
 
05:23:00.350 --> 05:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
better to reform it to streamline it to
 
05:23:02.670 --> 05:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
make it more efficient and I think that
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
those concepts are captured in this
 
05:23:07.548 --> 05:23:07.558 align:start position:0%
proposal so as I mentioned the insurance
 
05:23:09.230 --> 05:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
department worked Clos closely with
 
05:23:11.190 --> 05:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including Senator rardy
 
05:23:13.230 --> 05:23:13.240 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel representatives
 
05:23:15.070 --> 05:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
from the insurance industry the hospital
 
05:23:17.310 --> 05:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
Association and the medical society to
 
05:23:19.310 --> 05:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
come up with consensus language included
 
05:23:22.190 --> 05:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
in the bill as amended before you the
 
05:23:23.868 --> 05:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
parties all came to the table in good
 
05:23:25.948 --> 05:23:25.958 align:start position:0%
faith and with open minds which allow
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
the group to reach agreement on
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
important improvements to the prior
 
05:23:31.750 --> 05:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
authorization process these improvements
 
05:23:33.990 --> 05:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
help make the prior authorization
 
05:23:37.070 --> 05:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
process more efficient and will ensure
 
05:23:38.708 --> 05:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
that patients receive time family
 
05:23:40.708 --> 05:23:40.718 align:start position:0%
responses to prior authorization
 
05:23:43.548 --> 05:23:43.558 align:start position:0%
requests in particular it requires
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
carriers to process prior authorization
 
05:23:48.548 --> 05:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
requests within seven calendar days when
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
submitted electronically and 14 calendar
 
05:23:54.390 --> 05:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
days when submitted using non-electronic
 
05:23:56.910 --> 05:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
processes in urgent situations a
 
05:24:00.310 --> 05:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
decision must be made within 72 hours
 
05:24:02.190 --> 05:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
the request will be deemed appropriate
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
if the carrier fails not to to fails to
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
make a decision in the allotted time the
 
05:24:10.510 --> 05:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill also set standards for
 
05:24:12.548 --> 05:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
reviewers making the determination to
 
05:24:14.990 --> 05:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that the reviewer has appropriate
 
05:24:17.670 --> 05:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
credentials and expertise necessary to
 
05:24:19.510 --> 05:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
apply the clinical
 
05:24:21.990 --> 05:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
criteria the proposed Bill allows
 
05:24:24.510 --> 05:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
providers the option to get more
 
05:24:27.670 --> 05:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility to provide uh peer-to-peer
 
05:24:32.030 --> 05:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
review prior to receiving a denial this
 
05:24:33.708 --> 05:24:33.718 align:start position:0%
can help streamline the process by
 
05:24:36.070 --> 05:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
allowing providers access to
 
05:24:38.470 --> 05:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer especially with complicated
 
05:24:41.628 --> 05:24:41.638 align:start position:0%
situations that may require more of an
 
05:24:43.910 --> 05:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
explanation and finally the bill will
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
require my department the insurance
 
05:24:47.708 --> 05:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
department to post certain prior
 
05:24:50.510 --> 05:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
authorization metrics for each carrier
 
05:24:53.430 --> 05:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
on its website to improve transparency
 
05:24:56.750 --> 05:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
and to empower consumers with critical
 
05:24:59.788 --> 05:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
information I would note that as the
 
05:25:02.670 --> 05:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
senator did uh several of these reforms
 
05:25:04.350 --> 05:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
are as a result of the federal
 
05:25:07.390 --> 05:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
government finalizing a proposed rule
 
05:25:09.150 --> 05:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
around reforming prior
 
05:25:11.430 --> 05:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
authorization those components are
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
captured in the amendment the benefit
 
05:25:17.190 --> 05:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
before you is that in many instances
 
05:25:19.070 --> 05:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
what is going to be federally required
 
05:25:20.350 --> 05:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
is now
 
05:25:23.110 --> 05:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
fast-tracked uh to take effect sooner
 
05:25:24.510 --> 05:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
the carriers understand that they're
 
05:25:26.470 --> 05:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
going to have to go through this process
 
05:25:29.030 --> 05:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
anyway and as part of their end of the
 
05:25:31.510 --> 05:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
compromise they've agreed to as I said
 
05:25:33.750 --> 05:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
expedite what is going to be required of
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
them and that is captured in The
 
05:25:38.750 --> 05:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
Proposal before you so with that said
 
05:25:41.030 --> 05:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're happy to take
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
questions uh I don't know if this is for
 
05:25:45.868 --> 05:25:45.878 align:start position:0%
you or Al who who did the fiscal
 
05:25:48.750 --> 05:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
note the department did I would assum
 
05:25:50.628 --> 05:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
because the senator said this was going
 
05:25:54.510 --> 05:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
to save us $16 billion do and and I
 
05:25:56.510 --> 05:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't see that in the fiscal Noe at all
 
05:26:00.150 --> 05:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
I see this could be incrementally costs
 
05:26:00.160 --> 05:26:01.470 align:start position:0%
I see this could be incrementally costs
us

05:26:01.470 --> 05:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
us
 
05:26:05.788 --> 05:26:05.798 align:start position:0%
money right I realize but let's just
 
05:26:08.910 --> 05:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
say because the fiscal node says there's
 
05:26:10.590 --> 05:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
potential incremental cost because this
 
05:26:12.548 --> 05:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer might mean they're going to
 
05:26:14.510 --> 05:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
have to pay for somebody more expensive
 
05:26:18.270 --> 05:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
to take the phone call and
 
05:26:22.948 --> 05:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
then and and then yeah so yeah our
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was more
 
05:26:27.230 --> 05:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
shortterm uh
 
05:26:31.350 --> 05:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
Vision short okay all right all right so
 
05:26:32.948 --> 05:26:32.958 align:start position:0%
but so theoretically didn't know
 
05:26:35.628 --> 05:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily any actual savings and we
 
05:26:37.390 --> 05:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
don't know that there really is that's
 
05:26:40.670 --> 05:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
more speculative yes okay that makes me
 
05:26:42.868 --> 05:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
feel better thank
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
you any other questions for the det
 
05:26:48.910 --> 05:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
Department yes I I want to would you
 
05:26:52.390 --> 05:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
believe that I'm uh I really like it
 
05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
when the state is making an effort to
 
05:26:59.948 --> 05:26:59.958 align:start position:0%
synthesize with the feder government and
 
05:27:02.350 --> 05:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have to say thank you
 
05:27:04.948 --> 05:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much would you believe I
 
05:27:07.628 --> 05:27:07.638 align:start position:0%
would most of the time thank you very
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
much Gent thank you welcome uh I
 
05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
apologize representative Nagel I didn't
 
05:27:18.030 --> 05:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
areel yeah you're supposed to you
 
05:27:22.548 --> 05:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill yeah I'm supposed
 
05:27:25.788 --> 05:27:25.798 align:start position:0%
to call you up sooner rather than later
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to save the Dust for last
 
05:27:31.110 --> 05:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I could could have done that but we
 
05:27:32.470 --> 05:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
always assume that you have other
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
important business to attend to I
 
05:27:34.480 --> 05:27:38.590 align:start position:0%
important business to attend to I
actually

05:27:38.590 --> 05:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:49.948 --> 05:27:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
go um there's two handouts there that um
 
05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
the one I'd already sent all of you um
 
05:27:58.390 --> 05:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's just my written testimony the other
 
05:28:00.750 --> 05:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
one is a statement from the AMA about
 
05:28:02.510 --> 05:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
why this issue is important and I didn't
 
05:28:04.230 --> 05:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
really want to spend a lot of time to go
 
05:28:06.510 --> 05:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
over these details with you for the
 
05:28:08.190 --> 05:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
record I'm David Nagel I'm a
 
05:28:10.430 --> 05:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative I'm also a physician I
 
05:28:12.830 --> 05:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
practiced in New Hampshire for 34 years
 
05:28:15.830 --> 05:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
now um I've been involved in advocacy
 
05:28:18.110 --> 05:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
work um for a very long period of time
 
05:28:20.868 --> 05:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
standing up for the rights of patients
 
05:28:23.470 --> 05:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
um I wrote a book a couple years ago on
 
05:28:25.990 --> 05:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
Pain Care policy and um there is a
 
05:28:27.910 --> 05:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
chapter actually or section in a chapter
 
05:28:30.310 --> 05:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
on prior authorization and its potential
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
good and bad effects on how we care for
 
05:28:35.390 --> 05:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
people this is a very important issue
 
05:28:37.430 --> 05:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
for me that's why I spent a lot of time
 
05:28:40.190 --> 05:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
on it I extremely honored to have been
 
05:28:42.670 --> 05:28:42.680 align:start position:0%
part of this multi- um
 
05:28:45.510 --> 05:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group um I'm so honored to
 
05:28:47.708 --> 05:28:47.718 align:start position:0%
work with do uh doctor you are now a
 
05:28:51.070 --> 05:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
doctor rardy Senator rardy on this um on
 
05:28:52.628 --> 05:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
this bill and it's it's been a real
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
great learning experience for me um one
 
05:28:58.350 --> 05:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the things that's really important to
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
me and why this bill is important is
 
05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
that we're in a in a healthc care
 
05:29:05.390 --> 05:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
climate right now where we're watching
 
05:29:07.510 --> 05:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
The Rise the fall of the Private
 
05:29:09.670 --> 05:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
Practice where at some point in time it
 
05:29:11.628 --> 05:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
will cease to exist and that really
 
05:29:15.390 --> 05:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
scares me and there are two cost reasons
 
05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
that are killing Private Practice one is
 
05:29:19.628 --> 05:29:19.638 align:start position:0%
the electronic record and the other is
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
prior authorization the question was
 
05:29:25.270 --> 05:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
asked earlier about you know non doctor
 
05:29:27.070 --> 05:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
practices physical therapists
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
chiropractors things like that um as
 
05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
they become part of the medical
 
05:29:35.708 --> 05:29:35.718 align:start position:0%
mainstream I keep asking them all over
 
05:29:37.150 --> 05:29:37.160 align:start position:0%
and over why do you want to be part of
 
05:29:38.990 --> 05:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
the medical mainstream you can't afford
 
05:29:41.230 --> 05:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
it and and I don't think that's a good
 
05:29:43.110 --> 05:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
thing and that's why reforms of this
 
05:29:46.110 --> 05:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
type are important
 
05:29:49.510 --> 05:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
um my role in this and why how this came
 
05:29:51.948 --> 05:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
to be that's what I want to focus on I I
 
05:29:54.590 --> 05:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
am a middle child born on a Wednesday I
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
end up in the middle of everything um my
 
05:29:59.430 --> 05:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues will be very upset with me to
 
05:30:01.030 --> 05:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
hear me say that I think prior
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
authorization is important the reason
 
05:30:05.470 --> 05:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's important is doctors are really
 
05:30:07.990 --> 05:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
good at assessing risk benefit and
 
05:30:09.948 --> 05:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
meaningful outcome of our interventions
 
05:30:12.750 --> 05:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
we stink when it comes to cost benefit
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
and there needs to be some level of
 
05:30:16.470 --> 05:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
oversight and as was stated earlier
 
05:30:18.270 --> 05:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the point of prior
 
05:30:22.070 --> 05:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
authorization is however the system
 
05:30:24.708 --> 05:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't work very well I I think um my
 
05:30:26.628 --> 05:30:26.638 align:start position:0%
folks my colleagues at the insurance
 
05:30:29.070 --> 05:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
commission were polite in saying how the
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
system can work I think it has a lot of
 
05:30:34.430 --> 05:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
problems in reform is important on the
 
05:30:36.788 --> 05:30:36.798 align:start position:0%
sheets I handed out you I listed all the
 
05:30:40.548 --> 05:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
problems my uh transcript of uh my note
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
I listed all the problems I don't really
 
05:30:44.788 --> 05:30:44.798 align:start position:0%
want to go in any detail the way we
 
05:30:46.788 --> 05:30:46.798 align:start position:0%
started looking at this was well over a
 
05:30:46.798 --> 05:30:47.628 align:start position:0%
started looking at this was well over a
year

05:30:47.628 --> 05:30:47.638 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:30:50.350 --> 05:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
ago um I talked to the folks at the
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
medical society when I ran for office I
 
05:30:54.390 --> 05:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
said this was important to me what do we
 
05:30:56.548 --> 05:30:56.558 align:start position:0%
do they showed me the legislation that
 
05:30:58.430 --> 05:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
had been looked over at the last couple
 
05:31:00.030 --> 05:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
years and it really didn't address
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
meaningful broad-based reform and I said
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
well we really got to do something
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
better so why don't we hear from you
 
05:31:09.070 --> 05:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
know the people find out well what are
 
05:31:11.430 --> 05:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
the problems so Mike padmore who used to
 
05:31:13.910 --> 05:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
be with the med Society put together a
 
05:31:16.628 --> 05:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
town hall meeting for us and and we sat
 
05:31:19.788 --> 05:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
down uh there were 50 doctors a lot from
 
05:31:22.270 --> 05:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
private practice I was impressed by that
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
and we sat down and looked at what are
 
05:31:26.470 --> 05:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
the problems everything was listed on
 
05:31:29.310 --> 05:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
what I just handed you um and what are
 
05:31:30.948 --> 05:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
the potential Solutions what do we need
 
05:31:32.948 --> 05:31:32.958 align:start position:0%
to accomplish I mean issues of
 
05:31:35.990 --> 05:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
transparency cost time energy all those
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
things were listed so then we looked and
 
05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
found that the AMA had already done all
 
05:31:43.310 --> 05:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
the work for us they created a template
 
05:31:45.510 --> 05:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
on a meaningful healthc care reform this
 
05:31:47.910 --> 05:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
is a huge issue for them there are 90
 
05:31:50.510 --> 05:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
bills in 30 States looking at this issue
 
05:31:54.070 --> 05:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's really important um
 
05:31:55.590 --> 05:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
and I looked at it and I said well this
 
05:31:57.830 --> 05:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
is a good template for where to start so
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's what we did I then went beyond
 
05:32:01.750 --> 05:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
that because again I'm concerned about
 
05:32:03.510 --> 05:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
other people so I met with a physical
 
05:32:05.390 --> 05:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
therapist I met with the chiropractors I
 
05:32:07.270 --> 05:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
said whatat do you guys want out of this
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
and we started looking at well you know
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
what could we do and so whatever we did
 
05:32:14.150 --> 05:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
whatever reform measure we did it had to
 
05:32:16.670 --> 05:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
satisfy everybody not just Physicians
 
05:32:18.948 --> 05:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
that was really important to me and I'm
 
05:32:20.830 --> 05:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
very honored that that's been honored in
 
05:32:23.470 --> 05:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
this process
 
05:32:26.270 --> 05:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
um once all that was done we sat down
 
05:32:28.430 --> 05:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
and created a subcommittee and we wanted
 
05:32:30.190 --> 05:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
to look through the am guide and see
 
05:32:31.390 --> 05:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
well how does this work for New
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that's what we did um we
 
05:32:35.548 --> 05:32:35.558 align:start position:0%
looked at their model as a template
 
05:32:37.390 --> 05:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
Michigan had already passed the law we
 
05:32:39.150 --> 05:32:39.160 align:start position:0%
looked at that as a model we looked at
 
05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
several of the other state models in the
 
05:32:43.750 --> 05:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
midst of all this Paul am minahan had
 
05:32:45.990 --> 05:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out that Senator rardy was very
 
05:32:47.548 --> 05:32:47.558 align:start position:0%
interested and she did one of the
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
smartest things ever um we sat down
 
05:32:52.110 --> 05:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
talked with her and it was her
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we sit down and talk
 
05:32:56.070 --> 05:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
with the insurers about that and that's
 
05:32:57.708 --> 05:32:57.718 align:start position:0%
what led to this you know
 
05:33:01.030 --> 05:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
multi-stakeholder effort um and that's
 
05:33:02.708 --> 05:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
what led to the bill that's right before
 
05:33:06.110 --> 05:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
you um God shined Upon Us 3 days before
 
05:33:08.708 --> 05:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
our Senate testimony this Ms reforms
 
05:33:10.948 --> 05:33:10.958 align:start position:0%
were released it's 800 Pages if you've
 
05:33:13.390 --> 05:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
got nothing better to do to look through
 
05:33:15.310 --> 05:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
that I do have a shortened version of
 
05:33:16.990 --> 05:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
that but what we found was what they did
 
05:33:19.390 --> 05:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
what we did was very similar and that
 
05:33:21.190 --> 05:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
made us feel better and the reason why
 
05:33:24.270 --> 05:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
that was important was a lot of people
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
weren't thrilled with what we were doing
 
05:33:27.390 --> 05:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
because it would only affect the
 
05:33:29.110 --> 05:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance industry which is
 
05:33:31.910 --> 05:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
like 25% of the market the minute we did
 
05:33:35.310 --> 05:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
this with them 75% of the market
 
05:33:37.350 --> 05:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
overnight and that was a that was a
 
05:33:39.230 --> 05:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
really important thing because for this
 
05:33:41.548 --> 05:33:41.558 align:start position:0%
to be meaningful it had to be more
 
05:33:44.190 --> 05:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
broad-based um and as was stated their
 
05:33:46.070 --> 05:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
estimate is that we're going to save $15
 
05:33:49.230 --> 05:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
billion nationally you asked about the
 
05:33:51.590 --> 05:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
financial note I have a lot of concerns
 
05:33:55.990 --> 05:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
about that so um you know as far as I I
 
05:33:57.670 --> 05:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
personally see that in the long term
 
05:33:59.070 --> 05:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
especially I'm going to take a step back
 
05:34:01.150 --> 05:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
and say that this is a start it's not a
 
05:34:03.230 --> 05:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
finish there's other things that we want
 
05:34:04.750 --> 05:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
to accomplish things that aren't in
 
05:34:06.390 --> 05:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
there that really involve a lot more
 
05:34:08.910 --> 05:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
discussion um you know things like how
 
05:34:11.190 --> 05:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
do we pick what evidence base we use
 
05:34:12.590 --> 05:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
because right now every insurance
 
05:34:14.948 --> 05:34:14.958 align:start position:0%
company has their own that's crazy why
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
can't we have a uniform evidence base so
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have to all know what each
 
05:34:21.910 --> 05:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
insurer wants that's a step forward
 
05:34:24.070 --> 05:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's this concept of gold cards that
 
05:34:25.510 --> 05:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
you may or may not have heard of where
 
05:34:27.150 --> 05:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
if I'm really good with my prior
 
05:34:29.390 --> 05:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
authorizations I it's like that easy
 
05:34:31.310 --> 05:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
pass thing at the you know when you're
 
05:34:32.788 --> 05:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
going through the metal detectors at the
 
05:34:34.030 --> 05:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
airport I can't remember what it's
 
05:34:36.430 --> 05:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
called it it'd be like that you just go
 
05:34:37.948 --> 05:34:37.958 align:start position:0%
right through and all of a sudden you're
 
05:34:40.548 --> 05:34:40.558 align:start position:0%
not costing the system money you're
 
05:34:43.470 --> 05:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
saving money for everybody and and and
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
so I think in the end I mean I think
 
05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
everybody benefits the financial note
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
points out a cost to the insurer but to
 
05:34:52.750 --> 05:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
the private practitioners we seem to get
 
05:34:54.948 --> 05:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
and in and not insurers the private
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners and the regular docs I'm
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
not sure why we get lost in this because
 
05:35:01.830 --> 05:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
we would save a lot of money a lot of
 
05:35:04.190 --> 05:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
time a lot of energy and maybe I can
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
grow my hair back um and I think that
 
05:35:09.750 --> 05:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much all I've had the last
 
05:35:11.150 --> 05:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to say again it's been an
 
05:35:14.190 --> 05:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
honor to work with everybody um I don't
 
05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
think of this as a finish but a start
 
05:35:18.390 --> 05:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
and we created relationships that I
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
think are lasting that are going to go
 
05:35:22.390 --> 05:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
on for a while um because this is this
 
05:35:26.270 --> 05:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
is just a beginning so thank you thank
 
05:35:28.070 --> 05:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the committee
 
05:35:31.030 --> 05:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thanks I have a good
 
05:35:33.990 --> 05:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
one I think more than three minutes uh
 
05:35:35.548 --> 05:35:35.558 align:start position:0%
before I get to all the people who are
 
05:35:37.670 --> 05:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
in support we'll hear from Heidi who
 
05:35:41.110 --> 05:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
says she supports but also neutral you
 
05:35:42.830 --> 05:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
must be neutral about
 
05:35:52.590 --> 05:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:59.070 --> 05:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:01.390 --> 05:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
okay um Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:36:02.670 --> 05:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
05:36:04.708 --> 05:36:04.718 align:start position:0%
Heidi croll I work at Gallagher Callahan
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
and gartell um representing ahip
 
05:36:08.990 --> 05:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
America's health insurance plans the
 
05:36:10.670 --> 05:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
neutral part was simply that you know we
 
05:36:13.750 --> 05:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
weren't um we weren't we didn't initiate
 
05:36:16.110 --> 05:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
the bill but we were very happy as other
 
05:36:18.990 --> 05:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
speakers have indicated um to um work
 
05:36:21.390 --> 05:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the Senators and um
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel and the
 
05:36:24.948 --> 05:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um the insurance department
 
05:36:27.670 --> 05:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
um so you know I want to sincerely thank
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
everybody it was as they've described um
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
a great stakeholder effort um everyone
 
05:36:34.990 --> 05:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
worked really hard and we collaborated
 
05:36:38.070 --> 05:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
um in order to get to this amendment um
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
um as you've heard lotss of meetings um
 
05:36:43.788 --> 05:36:43.798 align:start position:0%
lots of time and effort um so as you've
 
05:36:45.788 --> 05:36:45.798 align:start position:0%
heard from me uh and the carrier say on
 
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
many occasions uh utilization management
 
05:36:49.948 --> 05:36:49.958 align:start position:0%
including prior authorization does play
 
05:36:53.430 --> 05:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
a very important role in Managed Care um
 
05:36:55.628 --> 05:36:55.638 align:start position:0%
prior authorization ensures that patient
 
05:36:58.030 --> 05:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
care is consistent with most up-to-date
 
05:37:00.670 --> 05:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices um it helps
 
05:37:04.030 --> 05:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
lower a patients um out of pocket cost
 
05:37:06.070 --> 05:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
so they're not paying for Unnecessary
 
05:37:08.190 --> 05:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
care or they're not paying for more
 
05:37:10.030 --> 05:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
expensive care when there might be lower
 
05:37:11.910 --> 05:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
cost Alternatives available that are
 
05:37:14.430 --> 05:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate to try first um it prevents
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
the overuse and misuse of care as well
 
05:37:20.030 --> 05:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
as potentially um avoids harmful care um
 
05:37:22.190 --> 05:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
and finally it does trigger additional
 
05:37:26.190 --> 05:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
care coordination um for um you know in
 
05:37:28.868 --> 05:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
terms of the services for the patient so
 
05:37:30.590 --> 05:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
um From ahip's perspective this
 
05:37:32.628 --> 05:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
amendment does a good job to ensure that
 
05:37:34.750 --> 05:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
these benefits of prior authorization
 
05:37:37.190 --> 05:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
will continue um while also addressing
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
the interest of the sponsors and the
 
05:37:42.670 --> 05:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
providers um as you heard in mid January
 
05:37:45.150 --> 05:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
of this year CMS finalized its latest
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
rules on prior authorization to
 
05:37:49.548 --> 05:37:49.558 align:start position:0%
streamline the process um and the timing
 
05:37:50.948 --> 05:37:50.958 align:start position:0%
was very helpful in that the
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were able to kind of sync
 
05:37:54.990 --> 05:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
up some of the key provisions of the New
 
05:37:57.350 --> 05:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire proposal um with the federal
 
05:37:59.590 --> 05:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
proposal so I think it will be very
 
05:38:01.548 --> 05:38:01.558 align:start position:0%
helpful to Providers and the carriers
 
05:38:04.190 --> 05:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
alike um in standard standardizing some
 
05:38:06.788 --> 05:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
common practices um for example we have
 
05:38:09.150 --> 05:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
aligned the turnaround times for you for
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
issuing prior authorization decisions
 
05:38:13.628 --> 05:38:13.638 align:start position:0%
with the federal rules um we have
 
05:38:16.030 --> 05:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
aligned with moving toward um greater
 
05:38:18.510 --> 05:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
use of electronic prior authorization
 
05:38:21.110 --> 05:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
which the CMS rules um ultimately
 
05:38:23.470 --> 05:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
require of the carriers and the
 
05:38:25.948 --> 05:38:25.958 align:start position:0%
providers to kind of improve efficiency
 
05:38:28.788 --> 05:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
and streamline the process so um with
 
05:38:30.390 --> 05:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to try to answer any
 
05:38:32.830 --> 05:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
questions and um appreciate your time
 
05:38:35.868 --> 05:38:35.878 align:start position:0%
Andes has a
 
05:38:37.948 --> 05:38:37.958 align:start position:0%
question thank you for for letting me
 
05:38:39.670 --> 05:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
ask the question do you feel that
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's any confusion at the beginning
 
05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the process to understand exactly
 
05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
what requires prior authorization either
 
05:38:51.150 --> 05:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
on the provider side or the you know
 
05:38:53.670 --> 05:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
insured side I I always found that very
 
05:38:56.510 --> 05:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
confusing of what what I what needs
 
05:38:58.548 --> 05:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
prior authorization and then if you
 
05:39:01.510 --> 05:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't get prior off you get the service
 
05:39:03.150 --> 05:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
you get the bill you thought it was
 
05:39:04.750 --> 05:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
covered and it gets
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
confusing yeah I think by and large
 
05:39:10.750 --> 05:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
um I think providers are familiar with
 
05:39:12.948 --> 05:39:12.958 align:start position:0%
what you know in their day-to-day
 
05:39:14.670 --> 05:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
practice what requires prior
 
05:39:16.150 --> 05:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
authorization I think they're pretty
 
05:39:18.788 --> 05:39:18.798 align:start position:0%
familiar with that um and of course if
 
05:39:21.270 --> 05:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
they're using electronic systems they'll
 
05:39:23.590 --> 05:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
Al you know get alerted electronically
 
05:39:25.390 --> 05:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
about whether something requires a prior
 
05:39:28.468 --> 05:39:28.478 align:start position:0%
authorization so um it's not to say that
 
05:39:30.230 --> 05:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's a perfect system but I think by and
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
large people do understand um where
 
05:39:36.030 --> 05:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
those requirements are and carriers have
 
05:39:39.390 --> 05:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
you know they're continually viewing um
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
what um Services uh and products uh
 
05:39:45.708 --> 05:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
medical products do require prior
 
05:39:49.030 --> 05:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
authorization so they're continually um
 
05:39:50.948 --> 05:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
you know things that may have required
 
05:39:53.948 --> 05:39:53.958 align:start position:0%
prior authorization um no longer due um
 
05:39:55.670 --> 05:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
and then other things that may be new in
 
05:39:59.070 --> 05:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
the pipeline um might require it but I
 
05:40:00.948 --> 05:40:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know I do think there's I think
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
there's communication going on there
 
05:40:05.430 --> 05:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
that the doctors are
 
05:40:07.468 --> 05:40:07.478 align:start position:0%
aware thank you very much thank thank
 
05:40:13.548 --> 05:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:21.030 --> 05:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
Association hello Mr chairman members of
 
05:40:24.788 --> 05:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
05:40:26.350 --> 05:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
Ben Bradley I'm the vice president of
 
05:40:27.868 --> 05:40:27.878 align:start position:0%
state government relations for the New
 
05:40:30.468 --> 05:40:30.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association I am not
 
05:40:32.270 --> 05:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
going to read my testimony but I do want
 
05:40:33.750 --> 05:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
to cover a couple
 
05:40:36.430 --> 05:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
things you heard about the uh
 
05:40:38.230 --> 05:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders coming together and coming
 
05:40:39.788 --> 05:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
to an agreement working together on a
 
05:40:42.390 --> 05:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
solution abide at the Apple on prior
 
05:40:44.548 --> 05:40:44.558 align:start position:0%
authorization uh you heard about the
 
05:40:46.910 --> 05:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
importance of prior authorization what
 
05:40:49.628 --> 05:40:49.638 align:start position:0%
value it brings but yet the burdens uh
 
05:40:51.590 --> 05:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
that come with that and how this bill
 
05:40:53.230 --> 05:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
attempts to address
 
05:40:57.628 --> 05:40:57.638 align:start position:0%
those um in line with uh how CMS put
 
05:40:59.548 --> 05:40:59.558 align:start position:0%
forward their rule on prior
 
05:41:02.110 --> 05:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
authorization um you heard about the uh
 
05:41:03.910 --> 05:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
National savings projections and
 
05:41:05.390 --> 05:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
although something hasn't been done
 
05:41:07.430 --> 05:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
similarly in New Hampshire I think we
 
05:41:10.310 --> 05:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
can reflect on those National Savings of
 
05:41:12.670 --> 05:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars projected in savings
 
05:41:15.468 --> 05:41:15.478 align:start position:0%
from uh the rule from
 
05:41:19.150 --> 05:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
CMS um I wanted to quickly address a
 
05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
question that uh you had representative
 
05:41:27.190 --> 05:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
P pelli Portell um related to um what's
 
05:41:29.670 --> 05:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
expected of a in prior authorization and
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
knowing and not knowing and what what
 
05:41:33.390 --> 05:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
should be submitted I think Heidi
 
05:41:34.910 --> 05:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
covered that well but I'd also say
 
05:41:37.190 --> 05:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
elements of this bill pull from the CM
 
05:41:39.708 --> 05:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
Ms rule for requirements to publish um
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
what's expected for prior authorization
 
05:41:44.350 --> 05:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
so the hope is that transparency will um
 
05:41:47.230 --> 05:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
help inform providers as well um I too
 
05:41:48.990 --> 05:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
want to extend my appreciation for
 
05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%

05:41:52.510 --> 05:41:52.520 align:start position:0%

speak in support of Senate Bill 561 um
 
05:42:57.310 --> 05:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
as you've heard F Senate Bill 561
 
05:42:59.788 --> 05:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
establishes criteria around Prior
 
05:43:02.110 --> 05:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
authorizations and given the current
 
05:43:04.750 --> 05:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
variability variability of the way prior
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
authorizations are used this is a
 
05:43:09.310 --> 05:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
welcome change in mental health care
 
05:43:11.430 --> 05:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
prior authorizations are Mo most often
 
05:43:13.868 --> 05:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
used with medications higher levels of
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
care such as residential or intensive um
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
outpatient programs um as well as newer
 
05:43:23.670 --> 05:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
treatment procedures such as
 
05:43:25.788 --> 05:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
transcranial magnetic stimulation and
 
05:43:28.548 --> 05:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
ketamine assisted
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
therapy the application of Prior
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
authorizations by insurers can have a
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
detrimental effect on the health and
 
05:43:36.030 --> 05:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
well-being of their members and can
 
05:43:37.990 --> 05:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
disproportionately fect those seeking
 
05:43:40.830 --> 05:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Care according to a recent
 
05:43:42.750 --> 05:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
Kaiser Family Foundation survey which
 
05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
I've included for you folks um 26% of
 
05:43:49.310 --> 05:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
people who sought treatment for a mental
 
05:43:51.788 --> 05:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
health condition in the past year
 
05:43:54.468 --> 05:43:54.478 align:start position:0%
experienced an issue with prior
 
05:43:57.468 --> 05:43:57.478 align:start position:0%
authorization as compared to 133% of
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
folks who did not um seek mental health
 
05:44:02.350 --> 05:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
care so folks that are seeking Mental
 
05:44:06.070 --> 05:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
Health Care um are twice as likely to
 
05:44:08.910 --> 05:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
experience an issue um around a prior
 
05:44:10.750 --> 05:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
authorization with their with their
 
05:44:14.310 --> 05:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
health carrier um additionally people
 
05:44:16.510 --> 05:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
who whose insurance issues included
 
05:44:18.910 --> 05:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
prior authorizations were three times
 
05:44:21.230 --> 05:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
more likely to report being unable to
 
05:44:23.350 --> 05:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
receive medical care or treatment that
 
05:44:25.830 --> 05:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
was recommended by their provider as a
 
05:44:28.990 --> 05:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
direct result of their issues with their
 
05:44:30.390 --> 05:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
with the uh prior
 
05:44:33.830 --> 05:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
authorization um and we also know that
 
05:44:37.868 --> 05:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
um the survey showed that uh a majority
 
05:44:40.150 --> 05:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
of folks who had issues with prior
 
05:44:42.750 --> 05:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
authorizations also had
 
05:44:45.830 --> 05:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
detrimental uh effects to their health
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
and had increased out-of-pocket costs
 
05:44:52.708 --> 05:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
due to prior authorization issues so we
 
05:44:54.670 --> 05:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
do know that this is an issue and
 
05:44:56.670 --> 05:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
although we were not a part of the group
 
05:44:59.868 --> 05:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
that came together we are um thankful
 
05:45:01.910 --> 05:45:01.920 align:start position:0%

05:45:52.590 --> 05:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
here in strong support of Senate Bill
 
05:45:55.150 --> 05:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
561 um for all of the reasons you've
 
05:45:57.350 --> 05:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
heard already um and we just wanted to
 
05:46:01.030 --> 05:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
highlight a few um we uh appreciate that
 
05:46:02.628 --> 05:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
this bill would go far to provide both
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
patients and providers with the
 
05:46:06.270 --> 05:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
information they need to more promptly
 
05:46:08.868 --> 05:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
come up with a a um plan of care based
 
05:46:10.708 --> 05:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
on the insurance coverage available to a
 
05:46:13.350 --> 05:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
a patient secondly um we really
 
05:46:15.708 --> 05:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate that this would help ensure
 
05:46:17.628 --> 05:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers are utilizing medical
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
research and best practices to make
 
05:46:21.910 --> 05:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
decisions that are in the patients best
 
05:46:23.350 --> 05:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
interest through that peer-to-peer
 
05:46:26.150 --> 05:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
resource that was mentioned and we also
 
05:46:27.628 --> 05:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that this would
 
05:46:29.430 --> 05:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
provide patients providers and state
 
05:46:31.150 --> 05:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
Regulators with the information they
 
05:46:33.350 --> 05:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
would they need to hold Insurance
 
05:46:35.190 --> 05:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
insurers to account and ensure that they
 
05:46:36.990 --> 05:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
are working to support access to patient
 
05:46:39.430 --> 05:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
care um for those reasons new Futures
 
05:46:41.628 --> 05:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
would urge this committee uh to vote
 
05:46:43.590 --> 05:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 561 ought to pass and I'm
 
05:46:46.350 --> 05:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:49.270 --> 05:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions perfect thank you
 
05:47:11.468 --> 05:47:11.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:14.350 --> 05:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
better okay dear members of the House
 
05:47:16.150 --> 05:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for taking the time
 
05:47:19.030 --> 05:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
to hear my testimony today uh my name is
 
05:47:20.948 --> 05:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Christensen I have been a
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
practicing physician for 20 years here
 
05:47:25.948 --> 05:47:25.958 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh the majority of my
 
05:47:29.510 --> 05:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
patients have opioid use disorder and uh
 
05:47:32.150 --> 05:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
I currently am a solo practitioner I've
 
05:47:34.468 --> 05:47:34.478 align:start position:0%
been part of this uh from the beginning
 
05:47:37.230 --> 05:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
I was there when Mike padmore had the uh
 
05:47:39.910 --> 05:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
commit the meeting right back to my
 
05:47:44.868 --> 05:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
notes um and uh I I my outpatient clinic
 
05:47:47.070 --> 05:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
motivated Health choices in naswa I also
 
05:47:49.230 --> 05:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
work at marac for a for-profit clinic so
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
that I can keep my office uh running in
 
05:47:54.110 --> 05:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
nashwa I'm strongly in favor of the
 
05:47:58.310 --> 05:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 561 my patients uh who do
 
05:48:00.750 --> 05:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
well they become active members of the
 
05:48:03.708 --> 05:48:03.718 align:start position:0%
workforce and they increase their work
 
05:48:06.750 --> 05:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
and they end up going to a commercials
 
05:48:09.310 --> 05:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
insurance and usually lose their uh
 
05:48:12.510 --> 05:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
ability to get medication at that point
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
um if they're not allowed to continue
 
05:48:18.030 --> 05:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
their medication assisted recovery they
 
05:48:20.070 --> 05:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
go into withdrawals and even with
 
05:48:21.868 --> 05:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
withdrawal medications there is a chance
 
05:48:25.510 --> 05:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
of relapse uh I I keep my patients out
 
05:48:28.548 --> 05:48:28.558 align:start position:0%
of the ER because they come to me for
 
05:48:34.190 --> 05:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
medications and um they do very well uh
 
05:48:35.830 --> 05:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
I can tell you about all the deaths that
 
05:48:37.910 --> 05:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
I've had while awaiting for uh prior
 
05:48:40.430 --> 05:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
offs but I think that can that can be
 
05:48:43.750 --> 05:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
left as a non-spoken thing if they have
 
05:48:43.760 --> 05:48:48.270 align:start position:0%
left as a non-spoken thing if they have
any

05:48:48.270 --> 05:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.468 --> 05:48:50.478 align:start position:0%
questions none thank you thank you so
 
05:48:55.270 --> 05:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:10.270 --> 05:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
hi I'm Steve Gardner thank you for uh
 
05:49:15.948 --> 05:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
hearing me uh I didn't prepare a written
 
05:49:18.830 --> 05:49:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh statement here uh this is
 
05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
something I learned of just a few weeks
 
05:49:23.548 --> 05:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
ago that there was a public hearing and
 
05:49:25.670 --> 05:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh and just learned today that I could
 
05:49:29.910 --> 05:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
speak um but we we had personally a case
 
05:49:32.030 --> 05:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
I've had two cases now where prior
 
05:49:35.990 --> 05:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
authorization has impacted Health uh uh
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:49:40.070 --> 05:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
my my wife went to the
 
05:49:43.030 --> 05:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
doctor um and they did an x-ray
 
05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
abdominal X-ray and determined that uh
 
05:49:49.230 --> 05:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
they weren't able to determine what the
 
05:49:51.430 --> 05:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
issue was she hadn't been feeling well
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
for a few
 
05:49:57.948 --> 05:49:57.958 align:start position:0%
weeks um and they uh asked to get a CAT
 
05:50:00.270 --> 05:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
scan they said we'll have to get prior
 
05:50:03.750 --> 05:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
authorization so we waited for that uh a
 
05:50:05.708 --> 05:50:05.718 align:start position:0%
few days later we ended up in the
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
emergency room at
 
05:50:11.468 --> 05:50:11.478 align:start position:0%
conquered uh and she had a perforated
 
05:50:15.310 --> 05:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
diabetica infected her uh whole abdomen
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
spent three weeks in the hospital in
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
critical care and has since gone through
 
05:50:23.708 --> 05:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
multiple surgeries uh thankfully she's
 
05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
with us
 
05:50:28.350 --> 05:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
today um but the prior
 
05:50:30.708 --> 05:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
authorization prevented us from going
 
05:50:33.830 --> 05:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
ahead and getting the CAT scan done uh
 
05:50:36.390 --> 05:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
immediately and they do say at the at
 
05:50:38.990 --> 05:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
the doctor's office if you feel it's an
 
05:50:43.670 --> 05:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
emergency go to the emergency room and
 
05:50:46.590 --> 05:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
we didn't think it was uh necessary to
 
05:50:47.990 --> 05:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
go there so we
 
05:50:51.468 --> 05:50:51.478 align:start position:0%
waited uh and that was a mistake
 
05:50:54.190 --> 05:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
obviously uh but the prior authorization
 
05:50:56.990 --> 05:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
process the way it is now I I got the
 
05:51:00.270 --> 05:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
denial two weeks later I opened it up on
 
05:51:03.190 --> 05:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
Christmas Eve seeing I got a denial and
 
05:51:05.910 --> 05:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
just about went through the roof uh I've
 
05:51:07.750 --> 05:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
since been doing doing a lot of research
 
05:51:10.750 --> 05:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
on prior authorization and how this has
 
05:51:14.350 --> 05:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
impacted people the AMA as as one of the
 
05:51:17.510 --> 05:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
people of reference has done a lot of
 
05:51:20.350 --> 05:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
Articles uh on prior authorization the
 
05:51:23.310 --> 05:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
need for reform this bill goes a long
 
05:51:27.750 --> 05:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
ways to promote that but uh not far
 
05:51:29.948 --> 05:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
enough uh the
 
05:51:33.310 --> 05:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
electronic um having this data
 
05:51:36.030 --> 05:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
electronically available should be able
 
05:51:39.670 --> 05:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
to get the doctor's authorization on the
 
05:51:42.190 --> 05:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
spot they shouldn't have to wait even 72
 
05:51:46.230 --> 05:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
hours for Urgent request because many of
 
05:51:49.788 --> 05:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
the criteria are you know I went through
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
and looked at the criteria for um my
 
05:51:55.230 --> 05:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
wife's case and they required a
 
05:51:58.310 --> 05:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
abdominal x-ray which she had and for
 
05:52:01.350 --> 05:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
some reason it was deemed medically
 
05:52:05.390 --> 05:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um I had another case a few
 
05:52:08.590 --> 05:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
we a few years earlier where I had a a
 
05:52:12.708 --> 05:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
kidney stone prior authorization similar
 
05:52:16.510 --> 05:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
issue it was uh denied they they say go
 
05:52:18.030 --> 05:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
to the emergency room well I wasn't
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
going to go to the emergency room it was
 
05:52:23.150 --> 05:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
during Co at that time uh so I wasn't
 
05:52:25.990 --> 05:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
stepping uh into an emergency
 
05:52:29.190 --> 05:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
room wasn't an emergency so I so I
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
didn't go just went through the pain
 
05:52:34.030 --> 05:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
ended up having it removed uh and they
 
05:52:36.510 --> 05:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
did CAT scans in order to remove it
 
05:52:37.548 --> 05:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
because it was something that wasn't
 
05:52:40.070 --> 05:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
going to pass um but the prior
 
05:52:43.548 --> 05:52:43.558 align:start position:0%
authorization process currently uh
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
definitely needs to be reformed and I'm
 
05:52:47.390 --> 05:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
glad to hear that there's going to be
 
05:52:49.948 --> 05:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
additional bills coming through I don't
 
05:52:51.548 --> 05:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
know if you remember representative
 
05:52:54.990 --> 05:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
buroughs I contacted you uh a little
 
05:52:57.750 --> 05:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
over a year ago concerning prior
 
05:52:59.788 --> 05:52:59.798 align:start position:0%
authorization uh and trying to get a
 
05:53:02.788 --> 05:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
bill uh started and I'm glad to see that
 
05:53:07.150 --> 05:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
this uh is is now in place and I hope
 
05:53:11.030 --> 05:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
that everyone here supports it thank
 
05:53:13.910 --> 05:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
you questions represent
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
buros just a quick question in case of
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
your wife um if she had gotten the prior
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
authorization quickly would it have
 
05:53:25.548 --> 05:53:25.558 align:start position:0%
prevented some of the consequent
 
05:53:30.230 --> 05:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
surgeries Etc uh I certainly can't say
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
for certain because it was a few days
 
05:53:35.948 --> 05:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
later that we were in the emergency room
 
05:53:38.548 --> 05:53:38.558 align:start position:0%
um but she needed that surgery
 
05:53:41.270 --> 05:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
immediately and what happened is it it
 
05:53:43.990 --> 05:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
ruptured and infected her whole
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
abdomen uh and every every day every
 
05:53:50.628 --> 05:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
hour counts when you're you have an
 
05:53:52.110 --> 05:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
infection that
 
05:53:55.990 --> 05:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
bad um so I don't think the perforation
 
05:53:58.230 --> 05:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
had uh
 
05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
fully uh infected her abdomen at that
 
05:54:04.230 --> 05:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
point and few day a few days later we
 
05:54:08.708 --> 05:54:08.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:12.590 --> 05:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
in thank you for coming appreciate it
 
05:54:14.390 --> 05:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
05:54:14.400 --> 05:54:15.990 align:start position:0%
okay I

I'm the state senator from District 5
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
covering a large part of Grafton part of
 
06:00:30.708 --> 06:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County and one town in marac
 
06:00:33.468 --> 06:00:33.478 align:start position:0%
County the beautiful town of New London
 
06:00:35.708 --> 06:00:35.718 align:start position:0%
so I am here today to introduce Senate
 
06:00:35.718 --> 06:00:36.628 align:start position:0%
so I am here today to introduce Senate
bill

06:00:36.628 --> 06:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:00:40.510 --> 06:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
407 um this bill would require in an
 
06:00:43.190 --> 06:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
emergency and when out of network
 
06:00:44.910 --> 06:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
commercial insurers to pay ambulance
 
06:00:46.948 --> 06:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
services directly for the care and
 
06:00:50.270 --> 06:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
transportation provided at rates set by
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
a community in a public process or a
 
06:00:56.230 --> 06:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
percentage of Medicare whichever is less
 
06:00:57.910 --> 06:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to go into detail but not
 
06:00:59.548 --> 06:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
too much because I've got five o'clock
 
06:01:02.948 --> 06:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
on my mind so during emergencies
 
06:01:05.390 --> 06:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
patients the consumers of healthcare
 
06:01:07.190 --> 06:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
should not have have to worry about
 
06:01:09.948 --> 06:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
being in or being out of network nor
 
06:01:11.430 --> 06:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
should the ambulance services when
 
06:01:13.910 --> 06:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
trying to navigate these situations so
 
06:01:15.628 --> 06:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
it's Groundhog Day for you it's a little
 
06:01:18.468 --> 06:01:18.478 align:start position:0%
Groundhog Day for me as well um I
 
06:01:21.070 --> 06:01:21.080 align:start position:0%
visited a house study committee report
 
06:01:23.468 --> 06:01:23.478 align:start position:0%
that was issued in 2018 and I actually
 
06:01:25.590 --> 06:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
think one of the hearings I was here for
 
06:01:27.590 --> 06:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
you representative am and you you were
 
06:01:30.190 --> 06:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
able to you had located this as well and
 
06:01:33.150 --> 06:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
in this report it cites going back to
 
06:01:35.468 --> 06:01:35.478 align:start position:0%
2009 the problem of insurance carrier
 
06:01:37.310 --> 06:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
reimburse ment for ambulance service
 
06:01:38.990 --> 06:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
Services has been discussed in the New
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature one of the final
 
06:01:43.990 --> 06:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations in this document is the
 
06:01:46.990 --> 06:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
direct pay part of this bill however
 
06:01:49.590 --> 06:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
here we are again now I understand
 
06:01:52.390 --> 06:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
you've passed 1081 um thank you very
 
06:01:54.190 --> 06:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
much I think it's a great bill and I
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
really appreciate all your hard work on
 
06:01:59.990 --> 06:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
that but as it stands today if you call
 
06:02:02.548 --> 06:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
for help and you are transported and you
 
06:02:04.390 --> 06:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
have commercial insurance coverage the
 
06:02:06.590 --> 06:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
payment for that service often goes to
 
06:02:08.350 --> 06:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
the patient not to the provider of the
 
06:02:09.750 --> 06:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
service I mean we have this established
 
06:02:11.350 --> 06:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
in this committee you know exactly what
 
06:02:13.390 --> 06:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about so I won't belabor
 
06:02:15.510 --> 06:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
this but I just want to be clear that at
 
06:02:17.990 --> 06:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
the time you dial 911 or you need an
 
06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
emergency transfer to a higher level of
 
06:02:21.390 --> 06:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
care so that's like if you're a trauma
 
06:02:23.150 --> 06:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
patient we needs to go to Dartmouth or
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
go to Boston this should not be an issue
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
worrying about whether you're a network
 
06:02:30.270 --> 06:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
or not the closest most appropriate
 
06:02:32.830 --> 06:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate service should be the key
 
06:02:37.230 --> 06:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
consideration um but and uh I've asked
 
06:02:40.430 --> 06:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
the um I've spoken with ahip um and
 
06:02:42.990 --> 06:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
tried to get a copy or a list a full
 
06:02:44.990 --> 06:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
list of all the ambulance services that
 
06:02:47.468 --> 06:02:47.478 align:start position:0%
are in network just so that that can be
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
considered as part of the conversation
 
06:02:50.548 --> 06:02:50.558 align:start position:0%
and Heidi croll has been helpful but we
 
06:02:52.990 --> 06:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a full list yet um and I
 
06:02:54.510 --> 06:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
trust I and have assurance that we'll
 
06:02:56.150 --> 06:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
get that because that's something that
 
06:02:57.310 --> 06:02:57.320 align:start position:0%
even through a couple months of
 
06:02:59.390 --> 06:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
discussion I'm not completely clear I
 
06:03:01.070 --> 06:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
know more are out of network that are in
 
06:03:02.910 --> 06:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
network but I'd like to be able to it's
 
06:03:04.110 --> 06:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
what you think what you know and what
 
06:03:06.030 --> 06:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
you can prove I'd like to be able to
 
06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
that out for you so the unwillingness or
 
06:03:11.670 --> 06:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
inability to pay services directly
 
06:03:13.310 --> 06:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of network status has
 
06:03:15.310 --> 06:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
resulted in putting patients in the
 
06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
middle because they're getting they're
 
06:03:18.990 --> 06:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
getting the check and some of them don't
 
06:03:20.628 --> 06:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
know what to do with it and some of them
 
06:03:23.910 --> 06:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
do um and it creates a gap in Revenue
 
06:03:26.910 --> 06:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
that's left the taxpayer to cover so the
 
06:03:28.830 --> 06:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
Valley News which is I'm from Lebanon is
 
06:03:30.910 --> 06:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
my hometown newspaper actually wrote an
 
06:03:34.510 --> 06:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
article on this on July 26 2024 Rising
 
06:03:37.190 --> 06:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance fees highlight shortfalls from
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
health insurance payments and it talks
 
06:03:41.110 --> 06:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
about this cost shifting that's
 
06:03:42.590 --> 06:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
happening because of this Gap that's
 
06:03:44.990 --> 06:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
been created so let's talk about the
 
06:03:46.190 --> 06:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
06:03:48.830 --> 06:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
service I believe and especially after
 
06:03:50.510 --> 06:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know serving at the local level I am
 
06:03:53.230 --> 06:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
a paramedic I've been a paramedic maybe
 
06:03:54.830 --> 06:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
many too many years I get my hair
 
06:03:56.110 --> 06:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
colored so I'm thinking we're going
 
06:03:58.548 --> 06:03:58.558 align:start position:0%
somewhere on 30 to 32 years of being a
 
06:04:00.350 --> 06:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
paramedic but I also have served as a
 
06:04:03.390 --> 06:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
city councelor um and a mayor and so I
 
06:04:04.990 --> 06:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
understand how communities make the
 
06:04:06.670 --> 06:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
decisions that they do about the
 
06:04:09.270 --> 06:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
services that they want to provide and
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost them so based on
 
06:04:14.468 --> 06:04:14.478 align:start position:0%
their size their location and the volume
 
06:04:16.910 --> 06:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
of emergency calls a community will
 
06:04:18.110 --> 06:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
decide how they're going to provide
 
06:04:20.310 --> 06:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
emergency medical coverage this could be
 
06:04:22.590 --> 06:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
one ambulance two ambulances are you
 
06:04:24.990 --> 06:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
going to have a certain level of provide
 
06:04:27.270 --> 06:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
of level of care that's available these
 
06:04:29.910 --> 06:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
are decisions that communities make and
 
06:04:31.190 --> 06:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get in the middle of
 
06:04:34.670 --> 06:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
communities making those decisions just
 
06:04:36.990 --> 06:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
like any other health healthare service
 
06:04:39.390 --> 06:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance care and transportation is a
 
06:04:41.708 --> 06:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
covered service by the public payers
 
06:04:44.070 --> 06:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
which is Medicare and Medicaid and
 
06:04:46.350 --> 06:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
private so they would be our signat our
 
06:04:50.948 --> 06:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
signat signas long day Anthem and I saw
 
06:04:52.868 --> 06:04:52.878 align:start position:0%
um Peter bragon here from Harvard
 
06:04:55.350 --> 06:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim Healthcare um these but it has
 
06:04:57.030 --> 06:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
to be part of the plan so the plan
 
06:04:59.590 --> 06:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
includes if it includes ambulance
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
Transportation then these private payers
 
06:05:04.230 --> 06:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
have a role in covering an ambulance
 
06:05:06.830 --> 06:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill that one of their benefici gets
 
06:05:09.510 --> 06:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
most if not all communities use a
 
06:05:11.150 --> 06:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
convention what I call it's conventional
 
06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
wisdom a mix of a per capita assessment
 
06:05:14.000 --> 06:05:15.350 align:start position:0%
wisdom a mix of a per capita assessment
for

06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:05:17.750 --> 06:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue to help support the emergency
 
06:05:19.948 --> 06:05:19.958 align:start position:0%
medical operation um and then there's
 
06:05:22.310 --> 06:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
also the revenue from the billing of the
 
06:05:26.350 --> 06:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
patients um we also recognize that there
 
06:05:28.910 --> 06:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
is a self pay component to this because
 
06:05:31.830 --> 06:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
not everybody has Medicare Medicaid or
 
06:05:34.310 --> 06:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
even private insurance Co coverage we're
 
06:05:36.548 --> 06:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
really close but we recognize that there
 
06:05:39.310 --> 06:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
are some self-pay cases that come that
 
06:05:41.750 --> 06:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
come into play the per capita largely
 
06:05:44.708 --> 06:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
covers the cost of Readiness um and the
 
06:05:47.030 --> 06:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
revenue from the billing of the
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers whether it's public
 
06:05:51.390 --> 06:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
or private covers largely the cost of
 
06:05:53.270 --> 06:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
care and
 
06:05:56.590 --> 06:05:56.600 align:start position:0%
transportation New England New Hampshire
 
06:05:58.830 --> 06:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
part of New England traditionally has
 
06:06:01.948 --> 06:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
lower reimbursement rates two GAO
 
06:06:04.788 --> 06:06:04.798 align:start position:0%
reports so our governmental Accounting
 
06:06:07.150 --> 06:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
Office says a Medicare reimbursing
 
06:06:08.788 --> 06:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance service has been
 
06:06:10.788 --> 06:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursing ground Ambulance Service
 
06:06:13.708 --> 06:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
below cost that's according to Fair pay
 
06:06:16.230 --> 06:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the past year for the first time in
 
06:06:19.670 --> 06:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
17 years we did see a raise from
 
06:06:23.468 --> 06:06:23.478 align:start position:0%
Medicaid they went from 38% to 50% to
 
06:06:27.750 --> 06:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
100% of Medicare and that's great but
 
06:06:30.468 --> 06:06:30.478 align:start position:0%
over time um this lower than average
 
06:06:33.030 --> 06:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement this issue with public and
 
06:06:35.150 --> 06:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
private and combined payments going to
 
06:06:37.110 --> 06:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
patients has shifted costs and
 
06:06:39.190 --> 06:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
destabilized the system so yes we have
 
06:06:40.990 --> 06:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
gotten a raise for Medicaid but we've
 
06:06:43.270 --> 06:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
been functioning for 17 years at the
 
06:06:46.628 --> 06:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
lowest average in New England now we're
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
not that's something we should all be
 
06:06:51.788 --> 06:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
proud of but still we have this problem
 
06:06:53.830 --> 06:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
the mems system in New Hampshire is not
 
06:06:55.990 --> 06:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
unlike the rest of our nation which is
 
06:06:57.750 --> 06:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
struggling reimbursement is a key
 
06:06:59.750 --> 06:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
contributing factor to the impending
 
06:07:01.708 --> 06:07:01.718 align:start position:0%
failure of our Primary Care safety net
 
06:07:03.310 --> 06:07:03.320 align:start position:0%

sustainable wages for our Personnel Safe
 
06:07:10.190 --> 06:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation we do need
 
06:07:11.708 --> 06:07:11.718 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art equipment because
 
06:07:13.110 --> 06:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
that's what you would want if you were
 
06:07:15.468 --> 06:07:15.478 align:start position:0%
sick or a family member of yours was
 
06:07:18.190 --> 06:07:18.200 align:start position:0%
sick and just like hospitals to be both
 
06:07:19.628 --> 06:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
you they they have state-of-the-art
 
06:07:21.868 --> 06:07:21.878 align:start position:0%
equipment this to be built specifically
 
06:07:23.910 --> 06:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
for use in the field without aligning
 
06:07:25.750 --> 06:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and including paying
 
06:07:28.190 --> 06:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
amulance Services directly for work done
 
06:07:30.230 --> 06:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
and at a rate that covers their costs we
 
06:07:32.990 --> 06:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
are enabling mounting pressure and again
 
06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
a lack of stability in a system you
 
06:07:38.390 --> 06:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
can't turn around well I mean I'm in the
 
06:07:40.468 --> 06:07:40.478 align:start position:0%
business so I'm watching this every day
 
06:07:43.030 --> 06:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
but there are consistently articles on a
 
06:07:46.110 --> 06:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
daily basis about the shortages of of
 
06:07:47.750 --> 06:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce about the shortages of
 
06:07:51.150 --> 06:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
ambulances some states are actually like
 
06:07:53.230 --> 06:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
like leaning into subsidies that's not
 
06:07:54.990 --> 06:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
what we're asking for here we're trying
 
06:07:56.948 --> 06:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
to approach this from a number of
 
06:07:58.830 --> 06:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
different ways to see if we can bring
 
06:08:00.830 --> 06:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
some stabilization to the problem so
 
06:08:03.230 --> 06:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's why we need your help so Senate
 
06:08:06.468 --> 06:08:06.478 align:start position:0%
Bill 407 specifically well back to my
 
06:08:09.110 --> 06:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
very my opening this is for out of
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
Network rates and these rates are set by
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
the community on the reasons that I told
 
06:08:15.788 --> 06:08:15.798 align:start position:0%
you how they decide how they're going to
 
06:08:18.548 --> 06:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
deliver their service what it costs them
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
so it's the rate set by the community or
 
06:08:24.990 --> 06:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
3 25% of Medicare whichever is lower
 
06:08:27.990 --> 06:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does not set rates it does not
 
06:08:30.708 --> 06:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
raise rates it sets a floor that
 
06:08:33.310 --> 06:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
communities can count on to cover their
 
06:08:35.830 --> 06:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
costs for when it's an emergency or it
 
06:08:37.468 --> 06:08:37.478 align:start position:0%
is what we call again an unscheduled
 
06:08:40.510 --> 06:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
transfer to a higher level of care why
 
06:08:43.110 --> 06:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
325 per this is a question that I've
 
06:08:45.190 --> 06:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
heard from a number of people well first
 
06:08:48.948 --> 06:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
of all five states have adopted 325
 
06:08:51.468 --> 06:08:51.478 align:start position:0%
per they either the the rate that's been
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
set by the community or 325 per of
 
06:08:56.468 --> 06:08:56.478 align:start position:0%
Medicare some Indiana adopted actually
 
06:08:58.110 --> 06:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
higher they're at
 
06:09:00.708 --> 06:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
400% some of the folks from the fire
 
06:09:02.670 --> 06:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
service and Emergency Medical Services
 
06:09:04.628 --> 06:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
Community will provide specific examples
 
06:09:07.110 --> 06:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
of how this would impact them but just a
 
06:09:08.628 --> 06:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
quick story I was speaking with the loud
 
06:09:10.430 --> 06:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
and fire chief we used to work together
 
06:09:11.548 --> 06:09:11.558 align:start position:0%
up in a place called Woodsville New
 
06:09:12.788 --> 06:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he's now the chief down
 
06:09:14.948 --> 06:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
here he called me up and he said sue
 
06:09:17.310 --> 06:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like the Three Bears we
 
06:09:19.830 --> 06:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
don't you know we don't want we don't
 
06:09:22.150 --> 06:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
need too much we can't continue to get
 
06:09:23.910 --> 06:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
too little can you bring us somewhere in
 
06:09:26.030 --> 06:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
the middle so we can do our
 
06:09:29.270 --> 06:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
job so that's that's one part of it
 
06:09:30.910 --> 06:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
again New Hampshire communities set
 
06:09:33.708 --> 06:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
their rate in a public setting by
 
06:09:36.150 --> 06:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
ordinance or by contract local officials
 
06:09:38.390 --> 06:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
raise their hand to approve or not what
 
06:09:39.670 --> 06:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
rates their Ambulance Service will
 
06:09:42.708 --> 06:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
charge in a publicly held open process
 
06:09:44.270 --> 06:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
not behind closed
 
06:09:46.990 --> 06:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
doors this bill only applies again to
 
06:09:48.948 --> 06:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
emergencies and again the unscheduled
 
06:09:51.628 --> 06:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
transfers this bill aligns it with the
 
06:09:54.190 --> 06:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
dispute process that's currently um
 
06:09:56.110 --> 06:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
managed by the department of insurance
 
06:10:00.510 --> 06:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
and if the work um s SP 173 goes forward
 
06:10:02.070 --> 06:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
which is surprise medical billing which
 
06:10:04.110 --> 06:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
you talked about earlier today I believe
 
06:10:06.150 --> 06:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
then we would fall under that for
 
06:10:08.070 --> 06:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
dispute process but right now it points
 
06:10:10.628 --> 06:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
to the existing one and would carry over
 
06:10:14.150 --> 06:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
um I um I'll wrap up by saying that I do
 
06:10:15.468 --> 06:10:15.478 align:start position:0%
really I know it you know it's like
 
06:10:16.788 --> 06:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
Groundhog Day and we've been talking
 
06:10:18.510 --> 06:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
about this for a while but it's really
 
06:10:20.910 --> 06:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
come to a ahead and we're trying to
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
build stability into this system I've
 
06:10:25.350 --> 06:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
heard concerns that have been raised and
 
06:10:26.948 --> 06:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
I just want to address them here that
 
06:10:28.350 --> 06:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
this would promote cost shifting that
 
06:10:29.868 --> 06:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
communities would say let's raise our
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
ambulance rat so we can get other things
 
06:10:33.708 --> 06:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
that's not how we do our business that's
 
06:10:36.230 --> 06:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
not the point of this there we're just
 
06:10:39.270 --> 06:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
saying communities make these decisions
 
06:10:41.990 --> 06:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is what it costs them so if it's an
 
06:10:44.310 --> 06:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
emergency why can't we take care of that
 
06:10:46.190 --> 06:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
or a percentage of that help to
 
06:10:48.310 --> 06:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
stabilize the system and pay the
 
06:10:50.788 --> 06:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
providers directly so I'm happy to take
 
06:10:53.070 --> 06:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll do my best I have
 
06:10:56.110 --> 06:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
other people here who um have much who
 
06:10:58.230 --> 06:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
have specific examples how this has
 
06:10:59.948 --> 06:10:59.958 align:start position:0%
impacted their community and our
 
06:11:01.510 --> 06:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
technical experts in the reimbursement
 
06:11:04.390 --> 06:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
World which I cannot profess to be thank
 
06:11:07.150 --> 06:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
you very much for your
 
06:11:09.350 --> 06:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
time questions we'll start with
 
06:11:09.360 --> 06:11:12.310 align:start position:0%
time questions we'll start with
representative

06:11:12.310 --> 06:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:14.468 --> 06:11:14.478 align:start position:0%
burrow thanks senator for taking my
 
06:11:16.670 --> 06:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
question for the five states that you
 
06:11:19.430 --> 06:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
said are are using this model um have
 
06:11:21.390 --> 06:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
they found it to be a sustainable
 
06:11:23.830 --> 06:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
business model it has so thank you for
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
the question representative burrow this
 
06:11:26.628 --> 06:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
has all happened within the last two
 
06:11:28.788 --> 06:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
years so I don't have the data to
 
06:11:32.190 --> 06:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
provide other than anecdotal so Indiana
 
06:11:34.150 --> 06:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
Indiana is the latest State and New York
 
06:11:35.948 --> 06:11:35.958 align:start position:0%
State just passed
 
06:11:38.628 --> 06:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
direct pay at full cost with no
 
06:11:40.350 --> 06:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of Medicare it was signed
 
06:11:42.350 --> 06:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
into law by the governor this past fall
 
06:11:44.430 --> 06:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
so I imagine that not imagine I know
 
06:11:45.390 --> 06:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
that if we were to have this
 
06:11:47.430 --> 06:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
conversation maybe two to three years
 
06:11:49.468 --> 06:11:49.478 align:start position:0%
from now we'd have some data to look at
 
06:11:52.548 --> 06:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
whether this is working thank you repres
 
06:11:54.628 --> 06:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
Ammon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:11:57.670 --> 06:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
senator for taking our questions um I
 
06:12:00.070 --> 06:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
just have a question about uh the
 
06:12:01.430 --> 06:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
possibility or maybe you could explain
 
06:12:06.110 --> 06:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
to me is is it possible that this could
 
06:12:09.150 --> 06:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
disincentivize uh ambulance providers
 
06:12:12.910 --> 06:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
from Contracting with insurers and uh
 
06:12:15.788 --> 06:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
establishing a in network relationship
 
06:12:16.750 --> 06:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
is there a way that this could
 
06:12:18.468 --> 06:12:18.478 align:start position:0%
disincentivize that I'm just trying to
 
06:12:20.430 --> 06:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
see the downside oh thank you
 
06:12:22.230 --> 06:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative M for the question and I
 
06:12:24.548 --> 06:12:24.558 align:start position:0%
welcome it in fact I actually think
 
06:12:27.430 --> 06:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
it'll incentivize look there incentivize
 
06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance services to go in network
 
06:12:31.070 --> 06:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's almost been like a standoff if I
 
06:12:33.190 --> 06:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
may kind of an okay Corral over this for
 
06:12:34.628 --> 06:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
a number of years so if we could all
 
06:12:36.948 --> 06:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
show good faith on both sides I think
 
06:12:39.030 --> 06:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
people should get into network but I'm
 
06:12:41.310 --> 06:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
not privy to those negotiations or what
 
06:12:43.510 --> 06:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
is offered to these Services during this
 
06:12:45.990 --> 06:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
but what I know is I have a willing and
 
06:12:48.510 --> 06:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
able EMS community that wants wants to
 
06:12:51.390 --> 06:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
move in that direction but this
 
06:12:53.788 --> 06:12:53.798 align:start position:0%
standof has to end and we have to come
 
06:12:55.510 --> 06:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
together so my position on this it's a
 
06:12:57.310 --> 06:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
great question is it actually I believe
 
06:12:59.150 --> 06:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
will incentivize because we'll find the
 
06:13:00.868 --> 06:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
good faith and we can start working
 
06:13:03.150 --> 06:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
together thank
 
06:13:06.390 --> 06:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
you representative Sullivan
 
06:13:08.788 --> 06:13:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um so this is going to
 
06:13:10.430 --> 06:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
highlight my ignorance on all of this
 
06:13:14.110 --> 06:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff but can you explain why
 
06:13:17.990 --> 06:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare is like the standard so I mean
 
06:13:19.868 --> 06:13:19.878 align:start position:0%
is is Medicare just allowed because it's
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
the government to underpay everything is
 
06:13:23.788 --> 06:13:23.798 align:start position:0%
that how it works and then like the
 
06:13:25.548 --> 06:13:25.558 align:start position:0%
private insurance has to subsidize
 
06:13:28.628 --> 06:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
things by paying multiple times what
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
that is or whatever the cost is so for
 
06:13:33.628 --> 06:13:33.638 align:start position:0%
number thank you for the question
 
06:13:35.948 --> 06:13:35.958 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan so for a number
 
06:13:39.150 --> 06:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
of years Medicare was the standard you
 
06:13:40.830 --> 06:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
know it was the place when I ran an
 
06:13:42.430 --> 06:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
ambulance service in the North country
 
06:13:45.190 --> 06:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know that was our most reliable form
 
06:13:47.190 --> 06:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
of reimbursement outside of again the
 
06:13:49.628 --> 06:13:49.638 align:start position:0%
per capita assessment per head but just
 
06:13:51.190 --> 06:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
like other things it has been left to
 
06:13:54.830 --> 06:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
wither has not been appropriately um
 
06:13:56.110 --> 06:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
well it's being appropriately assessed
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
now but it's been left to wither and has
 
06:14:01.030 --> 06:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
it has fallen off and is now running
 
06:14:03.190 --> 06:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
lower than average rather than being the
 
06:14:05.468 --> 06:14:05.478 align:start position:0%
gold standard than it once was of these
 
06:14:07.590 --> 06:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
providers behind me have completed a
 
06:14:09.990 --> 06:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
survey that was sent to them by CMS that
 
06:14:12.230 --> 06:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually does an assessment you know of
 
06:14:14.670 --> 06:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
their service of their rates is getting
 
06:14:18.310 --> 06:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
so they they are looking at from a CMS
 
06:14:20.708 --> 06:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
perspective at rate you know basically
 
06:14:22.430 --> 06:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
aligning Medicare with where it should
 
06:14:24.750 --> 06:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
be because it's not there now so some of
 
06:14:26.430 --> 06:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
the folks that have answered that survey
 
06:14:29.270 --> 06:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
can probably respond better so no it's
 
06:14:31.070 --> 06:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
not where it should be it's not the gold
 
06:14:33.030 --> 06:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
standard anymore we're actually starting
 
06:14:35.310 --> 06:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
to do better um you know on at least on
 
06:14:37.030 --> 06:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid side we've seen that we've
 
06:14:38.670 --> 06:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
like moved in the right direction we
 
06:14:41.270 --> 06:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
need the feds to catch up with us yeah
 
06:14:43.590 --> 06:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
06:14:46.990 --> 06:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions see none thank
 
06:14:48.390 --> 06:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
you very much again I really appreciate
 
06:14:52.190 --> 06:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
your time thank you okay uh so next up
 
06:14:54.070 --> 06:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to call is Alex F from the
 
06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
insurance department and he is
 
06:14:59.628 --> 06:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill as
 
06:15:02.110 --> 06:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
written with a nice little
 
06:15:06.310 --> 06:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
star Alex said file folders
 
06:15:09.990 --> 06:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:14.788 --> 06:15:14.798 align:start position:0%
Senator yes uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
06:15:16.830 --> 06:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
we're in opposition to Bill as written
 
06:15:19.548 --> 06:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
but we've um worked very hard on this
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
issue um and we actually um just last
 
06:15:26.750 --> 06:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
week have completed our work drafting an
 
06:15:29.868 --> 06:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
amendment that I think would achieve uh
 
06:15:33.270 --> 06:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
the goals of everyone in this room and
 
06:15:37.430 --> 06:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
um we're happy to to share that today
 
06:15:39.708 --> 06:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
I've already given a copy to Senator
 
06:15:43.070 --> 06:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
Apprentice um but let me just start with
 
06:15:45.788 --> 06:15:45.798 align:start position:0%
what the insurance uh Department a a
 
06:15:48.990 --> 06:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
copy of unpublished version of the
 
06:15:51.948 --> 06:15:51.958 align:start position:0%
amendment so we just drafted up
 
06:15:51.958 --> 06:15:53.548 align:start position:0%
amendment so we just drafted up
language

06:15:53.548 --> 06:15:53.558 align:start position:0%
language
 
06:15:57.468 --> 06:15:57.478 align:start position:0%
um uh the insurance department uh got uh
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
heavily involved in working on a
 
06:16:02.990 --> 06:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
resolution this issue last summer when
 
06:16:05.788 --> 06:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
we um hosted a series series of meetings
 
06:16:09.830 --> 06:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the various parties who um are
 
06:16:11.670 --> 06:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
interested in this issue of commercial
 
06:16:14.110 --> 06:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance reimbursement uh for
 
06:16:17.270 --> 06:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance services and about the
 
06:16:20.868 --> 06:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
problem of balance billing um that many
 
06:16:23.110 --> 06:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
consumers in the state have
 
06:16:26.110 --> 06:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
experienced um uh we had a lot of
 
06:16:29.910 --> 06:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
meetings um and a lot of interesting
 
06:16:35.750 --> 06:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
discussions um and I made new friends um
 
06:16:40.030 --> 06:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
um uh we issued we were ultimately
 
06:16:43.350 --> 06:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
unable to come to agreement on a concept
 
06:16:47.350 --> 06:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
I I feel that we came close um but uh we
 
06:16:50.990 --> 06:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
tried to capture um what progress was
 
06:16:53.910 --> 06:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
made um on the discussion with our
 
06:16:56.310 --> 06:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
report that uh we issued that's on our
 
06:16:58.548 --> 06:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
website and I also have a few copies
 
06:17:02.670 --> 06:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
here if anyone's interested in that um
 
06:17:06.750 --> 06:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
our perspective on uh this Center Bill
 
06:17:09.548 --> 06:17:09.558 align:start position:0%
407 is as written is that it doesn't
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
really come out of the work of the um
 
06:17:14.788 --> 06:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
the summit uh
 
06:17:18.910 --> 06:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
meetings um and it's um narrowly
 
06:17:21.868 --> 06:17:21.878 align:start position:0%
addressed to the simple issue of U
 
06:17:24.868 --> 06:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for ambulance services
 
06:17:27.390 --> 06:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
when what we really have is a cluster of
 
06:17:29.590 --> 06:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
issues that includes the problem of
 
06:17:33.468 --> 06:17:33.478 align:start position:0%
balance billing and uh the more Global
 
06:17:38.468 --> 06:17:38.478 align:start position:0%
problem of sustaining a a vibrant ground
 
06:17:41.990 --> 06:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
ambulance system in the state um because
 
06:17:44.670 --> 06:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
we all know costs are going up and it is
 
06:17:47.830 --> 06:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
a challenge for our local providers to
 
06:17:50.510 --> 06:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
maintain the level of service that ought
 
06:17:56.070 --> 06:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
to be there um so in terms of the summit
 
06:18:00.030 --> 06:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
our goals were to deal with the problem
 
06:18:01.110 --> 06:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
of balance
 
06:18:05.708 --> 06:18:05.718 align:start position:0%
billing um to come up with a system for
 
06:18:07.548 --> 06:18:07.558 align:start position:0%
adequate uh
 
06:18:09.948 --> 06:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
reimbursement uh for am ground ambulance
 
06:18:12.070 --> 06:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
services from commercial
 
06:18:15.670 --> 06:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
insurance and uh to set up a process
 
06:18:17.750 --> 06:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
that would address the longer term
 
06:18:21.590 --> 06:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
systemic issues that um are confronting
 
06:18:24.750 --> 06:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance providers in the state
 
06:18:27.910 --> 06:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
just small example the treat um no
 
06:18:31.070 --> 06:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
transport issue where uh ground
 
06:18:32.670 --> 06:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers are having trouble
 
06:18:35.310 --> 06:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
getting reimbursed but the have a lot of
 
06:18:38.030 --> 06:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
expense for their
 
06:18:38.040 --> 06:18:39.590 align:start position:0%
expense for their
service

06:18:39.590 --> 06:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:18:45.110 --> 06:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
um what one of the um developments that
 
06:18:48.830 --> 06:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
we found um encouraging was that the
 
06:18:51.030 --> 06:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
health carriers step forward and showed
 
06:18:54.190 --> 06:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
a willingness to increase their rates uh
 
06:18:58.110 --> 06:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
for ground ambulance services if um in
 
06:19:01.350 --> 06:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
effect they could buy an end to balance
 
06:19:05.390 --> 06:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
billing with that increase um and and
 
06:19:08.628 --> 06:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
one of the main concerns we have with
 
06:19:11.310 --> 06:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
the bill as written is that it um does
 
06:19:15.590 --> 06:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
not end balance billing so um it
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
establishes this rate of uh 325 per of
 
06:19:24.910 --> 06:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare or actual charge which from our
 
06:19:27.230 --> 06:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
claims data we found that actual charges
 
06:19:31.430 --> 06:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
are roughly 325 per of Medicare so
 
06:19:34.868 --> 06:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
they're in the you know in the ballpark
 
06:19:37.150 --> 06:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
and that would
 
06:19:40.270 --> 06:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
represent um roughly a doubling of
 
06:19:42.948 --> 06:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
current allowed
 
06:19:49.868 --> 06:19:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
um so the my point my main point is we
 
06:19:56.030 --> 06:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
should if we're going to be dealing with
 
06:20:00.310 --> 06:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
um the reimbursement issue um we should
 
06:20:02.948 --> 06:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
also be um prohibiting balance billing
 
06:20:04.750 --> 06:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
and this is what virtually every other
 
06:20:08.190 --> 06:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
state has done who has set these rates
 
06:20:10.750 --> 06:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
they also at the same time prohibit
 
06:20:16.628 --> 06:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
balance billing um what I'd like to to
 
06:20:20.510 --> 06:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
do is just to say what the goals are I
 
06:20:24.270 --> 06:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
think um for the summit meetings and for
 
06:20:27.830 --> 06:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment that that we're offering
 
06:20:29.590 --> 06:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh for the committee's
 
06:20:31.510 --> 06:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
consideration uh number one ground
 
06:20:33.430 --> 06:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
ambulance services should be funded in a
 
06:20:35.390 --> 06:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
manner that's sufficient to maintain an
 
06:20:37.070 --> 06:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
adequate and sustainable ground
 
06:20:37.080 --> 06:20:38.190 align:start position:0%
adequate and sustainable ground
ambulance

06:20:38.190 --> 06:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
06:20:40.990 --> 06:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
system number two the burden of funding
 
06:20:43.150 --> 06:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
a sustainable and adequate ground
 
06:20:44.788 --> 06:20:44.798 align:start position:0%
ambulance system in the State Should
 
06:20:47.190 --> 06:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
Fall not fall disproportionately on
 
06:20:50.310 --> 06:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
commercially insured consumers everybody
 
06:20:53.910 --> 06:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
should do their share and all consumers
 
06:20:55.468 --> 06:20:55.478 align:start position:0%
in the state should be protected from
 
06:20:58.670 --> 06:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance billing balance billing
 
06:20:59.948 --> 06:20:59.958 align:start position:0%
and from the heightened risk of
 
06:21:01.990 --> 06:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
untenable levels of consumer medical
 
06:21:04.990 --> 06:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
debt for ground ambulance services
 
06:21:08.310 --> 06:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
so just briefly um or as briefly as I
 
06:21:12.868 --> 06:21:12.878 align:start position:0%
can what we're proposing in the um in in
 
06:21:15.990 --> 06:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
our amendment is number one um a
 
06:21:18.510 --> 06:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on balance billing and
 
06:21:21.868 --> 06:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
number two the requirement of direct pay
 
06:21:23.948 --> 06:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
uh to the
 
06:21:26.510 --> 06:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
providers uh number three uh data
 
06:21:29.830 --> 06:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
collection on ground ambulance
 
06:21:33.670 --> 06:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
costs um one of the problems with
 
06:21:35.948 --> 06:21:35.958 align:start position:0%
picking a ray to today is we do not have
 
06:21:38.548 --> 06:21:38.558 align:start position:0%
good information about what cost and
 
06:21:40.670 --> 06:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
what we heard over and over again from
 
06:21:43.310 --> 06:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
the Fire Chiefs at the summit meetings
 
06:21:45.910 --> 06:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
where they just want to be adequately
 
06:21:48.628 --> 06:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for their costs including the
 
06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
06:21:55.030 --> 06:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
Readiness um and um in order to do that
 
06:21:58.030 --> 06:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
we have to have uh collection of data on
 
06:22:00.390 --> 06:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
cost so uh the amendment that we're
 
06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
providing sets up a process where that
 
06:22:05.070 --> 06:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
information could be collected
 
06:22:07.548 --> 06:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
and then an Actuarial firm would take
 
06:22:09.430 --> 06:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
that information and propose a rate
 
06:22:11.948 --> 06:22:11.958 align:start position:0%
structure and the criteria for that rate
 
06:22:15.430 --> 06:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
structure is that it must cover costs of
 
06:22:18.310 --> 06:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
providing the care including the cost of
 
06:22:24.310 --> 06:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
Readiness um in the interim um while the
 
06:22:27.270 --> 06:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
cost information is being gathered our
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh proposed amendment uh would increase
 
06:22:33.150 --> 06:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
the rates U because the prohibition on
 
06:22:35.150 --> 06:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
Balan billing would go into effect right
 
06:22:39.110 --> 06:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
away but not to the 325 per. we've
 
06:22:41.270 --> 06:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
looked at our claims data and we see the
 
06:22:44.350 --> 06:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
current allowed amounts right around
 
06:22:47.628 --> 06:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
118% of Medicare for the most common
 
06:22:51.750 --> 06:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
services so we uh our proposal would
 
06:22:54.910 --> 06:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
raise the rates on this stepped scale
 
06:22:58.788 --> 06:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
from 165 to 200% of Medicare as an
 
06:23:01.030 --> 06:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
interim measure it would be temporary
 
06:23:02.868 --> 06:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
and by the way these some of these other
 
06:23:04.590 --> 06:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
states that are raising the rates are
 
06:23:07.990 --> 06:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
also made them temporary uh because they
 
06:23:09.948 --> 06:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
had the same idea that they're going to
 
06:23:12.510 --> 06:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
take a temporary measure and then do
 
06:23:14.350 --> 06:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
some work to get better information
 
06:23:14.360 --> 06:23:15.510 align:start position:0%
some work to get better information
about

06:23:15.510 --> 06:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:23:20.468 --> 06:23:20.478 align:start position:0%
costs um so the um what would need to
 
06:23:23.910 --> 06:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
happen then is the actual rail firm
 
06:23:25.788 --> 06:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
would uh propose a rate schedule there'd
 
06:23:27.628 --> 06:23:27.638 align:start position:0%
be rule making to implement it with
 
06:23:30.110 --> 06:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
public input and then there would need
 
06:23:33.310 --> 06:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
to be um periodic review of that race
 
06:23:37.030 --> 06:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
schedule for the effect on the market on
 
06:23:39.868 --> 06:23:39.878 align:start position:0%
providers um and for any necessary
 
06:23:42.430 --> 06:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
adjustments to the rate schedule and
 
06:23:45.190 --> 06:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
then importantly uh the amendment that
 
06:23:48.788 --> 06:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
we propos creates a commission going
 
06:23:51.548 --> 06:23:51.558 align:start position:0%
forward to look at the more systemic
 
06:23:55.110 --> 06:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
issues around um ground ambulance
 
06:23:58.628 --> 06:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
services um that I mentioned or I I
 
06:24:01.910 --> 06:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned some of them but uh they're
 
06:24:05.590 --> 06:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
more to do with there more efficient
 
06:24:08.670 --> 06:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
delivery methods that we can be using um
 
06:24:10.430 --> 06:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
are there different policies we should
 
06:24:13.510 --> 06:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
have for facility to facility transfers
 
06:24:15.270 --> 06:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
versus Emergency
 
06:24:19.948 --> 06:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
Services um and uh there a number of
 
06:24:22.468 --> 06:24:22.478 align:start position:0%
important issues and this sets up a good
 
06:24:25.190 --> 06:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle for addressing them going
 
06:24:27.390 --> 06:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
forward um
 
06:24:31.190 --> 06:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
so taking up more than my share of
 
06:24:34.788 --> 06:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
time okay thank you Alex all right Nina
 
06:24:37.270 --> 06:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
you're representative burs
 
06:24:40.510 --> 06:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
okay repres my question is this has been
 
06:24:43.990 --> 06:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
going on for a long time um why hasn't
 
06:24:46.830 --> 06:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh the cost issue you know been
 
06:24:48.430 --> 06:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
fulfilled I
 
06:24:50.628 --> 06:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
mean are you saying that all these
 
06:24:52.708 --> 06:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
people in the these you know the the
 
06:24:54.750 --> 06:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
people that run the services have not
 
06:24:58.590 --> 06:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
provided you information on costs in the
 
06:25:01.070 --> 06:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
last 5 10 years is that what you're
 
06:25:03.868 --> 06:25:03.878 align:start position:0%
looking for is uh I'm saying that yeah
 
06:25:04.910 --> 06:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
we need
 
06:25:08.708 --> 06:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
uh uniform information and the uh
 
06:25:11.830 --> 06:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
medicare's effort to develop a uh cost
 
06:25:14.070 --> 06:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
reporting template is very useful in
 
06:25:16.430 --> 06:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
this regard because you need everybody
 
06:25:19.750 --> 06:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
reporting in the same format what we did
 
06:25:22.310 --> 06:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
during the summit was put out some
 
06:25:24.230 --> 06:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
questions to the ambulance providers
 
06:25:26.948 --> 06:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
relative to cost and we got answers in
 
06:25:29.830 --> 06:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
different formats um with different
 
06:25:32.548 --> 06:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
assumptions um and that has been
 
06:25:35.110 --> 06:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
historically the the be barrier to
 
06:25:38.868 --> 06:25:38.878 align:start position:0%
getting usable accurate data about cost
 
06:25:42.270 --> 06:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
is we need to basically um have a
 
06:25:44.750 --> 06:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
uniform method of accounting in order to
 
06:25:47.628 --> 06:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
establish those costs and I think we we
 
06:25:50.070 --> 06:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
have something that is great in that
 
06:25:55.270 --> 06:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:57.468 --> 06:25:57.478 align:start position:0%
tool okay representative
 
06:25:59.990 --> 06:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
Bros thanks for taking my question um
 
06:26:01.788 --> 06:26:01.798 align:start position:0%
the concern I mean the the things that
 
06:26:03.788 --> 06:26:03.798 align:start position:0%
you described that you want to
 
06:26:06.948 --> 06:26:06.958 align:start position:0%
accomplish all sound great but it sounds
 
06:26:10.628 --> 06:26:10.638 align:start position:0%
like a really long time frame and we
 
06:26:12.910 --> 06:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
have a situation here where we have
 
06:26:15.390 --> 06:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in you know from what
 
06:26:18.310 --> 06:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
we've heard past year in danger of going
 
06:26:21.270 --> 06:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
under so you know how can
 
06:26:23.948 --> 06:26:23.958 align:start position:0%
we move this forward so that we can help
 
06:26:26.590 --> 06:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
these folks out now right that's why the
 
06:26:29.070 --> 06:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
bill includes a short-term increase in
 
06:26:32.708 --> 06:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
rates um remember we have the Medicaid
 
06:26:34.590 --> 06:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
increase that just happened and then
 
06:26:36.548 --> 06:26:36.558 align:start position:0%
under this proposed amendment there
 
06:26:40.070 --> 06:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
would be an increase um in rates that's
 
06:26:42.468 --> 06:26:42.478 align:start position:0%
substantial relative to the existing
 
06:26:45.628 --> 06:26:45.638 align:start position:0%
existing allowed amounts and that would
 
06:26:48.110 --> 06:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
cover the period that take of time that
 
06:26:50.910 --> 06:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
it takes to do the study and develop a
 
06:26:53.310 --> 06:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
permanent race schedule so yeah cost
 
06:26:54.788 --> 06:26:54.798 align:start position:0%
would an increase would go into effect
 
06:26:54.798 --> 06:26:55.590 align:start position:0%
would an increase would go into effect
right

06:26:55.590 --> 06:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:26:58.230 --> 06:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
away F the question yeah I think you
 
06:27:00.628 --> 06:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
said would it it would go up from 100%
 
06:27:03.430 --> 06:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
to 200 something is what you said yeah
 
06:27:05.430 --> 06:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
and is that I guess you know we'll hear
 
06:27:07.390 --> 06:27:07.400 align:start position:0%
from people is that going to be enough
 
06:27:09.468 --> 06:27:09.478 align:start position:0%
in the interim to I see people shaking
 
06:27:10.910 --> 06:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
their heads no is that going to be
 
06:27:13.070 --> 06:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
enough to keep keep these places
 
06:27:17.910 --> 06:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
afloat right um we've uh done a draft
 
06:27:20.310 --> 06:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for our bill and for
 
06:27:27.070 --> 06:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
47 um as um as written um the it's based
 
06:27:29.750 --> 06:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
on the claims data so we just compare
 
06:27:32.468 --> 06:27:32.478 align:start position:0%
existing payment amounts to the various
 
06:27:35.708 --> 06:27:35.718 align:start position:0%
percentages of Medicare so the amendment
 
06:27:38.750 --> 06:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
we've written would increase income to
 
06:27:40.628 --> 06:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers by between two and
 
06:27:44.788 --> 06:27:44.798 align:start position:0%
three million and the U Amendment uh the
 
06:27:48.190 --> 06:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
bill as written would um increase
 
06:27:50.548 --> 06:27:50.558 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to ambulance providers by
 
06:27:54.548 --> 06:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
about 11 8.8 million or
 
06:27:56.788 --> 06:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
$447 per member per
 
06:27:56.798 --> 06:27:58.830 align:start position:0%
$447 per member per
month

06:27:58.830 --> 06:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
month
 
06:28:01.110 --> 06:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
premium represent
 
06:28:04.230 --> 06:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
spear okay so I'm looking forward to the
 
06:28:05.868 --> 06:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
amendment when when will that Amendment
 
06:28:14.070 --> 06:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:16.628 --> 06:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
up not yeah just to remind everybody we
 
06:28:18.468 --> 06:28:18.478 align:start position:0%
do have a subcommittee we'll be working
 
06:28:21.110 --> 06:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
on this bill tomorrow morning at 9 o' so
 
06:28:23.230 --> 06:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
we will certainly be addressing these
 
06:28:43.070 --> 06:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:46.230 --> 06:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry a follow on what did you
 
06:28:48.990 --> 06:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
say the uh the cost per member per month
 
06:28:51.590 --> 06:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
was going to be
 
06:28:54.350 --> 06:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
$447 if we passed the bill as introduced
 
06:28:59.030 --> 06:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
as yeah and so we can assume this is 2
 
06:29:00.910 --> 06:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
million so this is a lot less that's
 
06:29:04.750 --> 06:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
around a dollar a dollar so okay
 
06:29:07.070 --> 06:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
represent Ammon thank you Mr chair thank
 
06:29:09.868 --> 06:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
you for presenting your Amendment here
 
06:29:12.230 --> 06:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
um I have a question the original
 
06:29:15.150 --> 06:29:15.160 align:start position:0%
language of the bill it's a line 11 and
 
06:29:18.708 --> 06:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
it talks about a public process um you
 
06:29:20.270 --> 06:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
know in your understanding if could you
 
06:29:21.670 --> 06:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
explain how the public process would
 
06:29:23.990 --> 06:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
work in the original Bill and do you
 
06:29:25.750 --> 06:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
address that in the
 
06:29:29.590 --> 06:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
amendment um no in the amendment there's
 
06:29:33.628 --> 06:29:33.638 align:start position:0%
no reference to the local rate setting
 
06:29:35.990 --> 06:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's typically done at the municipal
 
06:29:41.510 --> 06:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
level um the concept that um we're
 
06:29:43.270 --> 06:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
putting forward in the amendment is that
 
06:29:46.510 --> 06:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
there be an actuar derived Statewide
 
06:29:50.190 --> 06:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
rate schedule that actually would vary
 
06:29:52.628 --> 06:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
from region to region but that's how it
 
06:29:55.510 --> 06:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
would be derived so my understanding is
 
06:29:57.868 --> 06:29:57.878 align:start position:0%
that under the uh Municipal process
 
06:30:00.310 --> 06:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
there's a public hearing for setting
 
06:30:03.548 --> 06:30:03.558 align:start position:0%
rates and that's about as much as I know
 
06:30:03.558 --> 06:30:06.590 align:start position:0%
rates and that's about as much as I know
about

06:30:06.590 --> 06:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:10.510 --> 06:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
that okay are we all said thank you very
 
06:30:10.520 --> 06:30:11.788 align:start position:0%
that okay are we all said thank you very
much

06:30:11.788 --> 06:30:11.798 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:30:14.750 --> 06:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
thanks okay
 
06:30:17.910 --> 06:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh so obviously a lot of you here want
 
06:30:19.708 --> 06:30:19.718 align:start position:0%
to come and tell us how this is this
 
06:30:21.190 --> 06:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
bills the greatest thing since sliced
 
06:30:23.708 --> 06:30:23.718 align:start position:0%
bread um and solves everything but I
 
06:30:25.948 --> 06:30:25.958 align:start position:0%
think it's important we uh get a
 
06:30:28.070 --> 06:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
balanced point of view here so I'm going
 
06:30:30.750 --> 06:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
to mix it up between for and against it
 
06:30:33.390 --> 06:30:33.400 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll start out with Chris tas's
 
06:30:46.750 --> 06:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:49.150 --> 06:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
06:30:51.230 --> 06:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
Chris stay was Halls New Hampshire um
 
06:30:53.310 --> 06:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Ambulance Association
 
06:30:54.628 --> 06:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
sorry I just got to bring up my
 
06:30:55.990 --> 06:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
testimony here and it would be a little
 
06:30:57.468 --> 06:30:57.478 align:start position:0%
bit different now that we've got an
 
06:30:57.478 --> 06:31:01.150 align:start position:0%
bit different now that we've got an
amendment

06:31:01.150 --> 06:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:03.910 --> 06:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
um which um I have to point I have
 
06:31:05.070 --> 06:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the
 
06:31:08.990 --> 06:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
amendment however um after 407
 
06:31:12.350 --> 06:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
unanimously passed the Senate we saw an
 
06:31:15.070 --> 06:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
offer from the insurers for the very
 
06:31:17.468 --> 06:31:17.478 align:start position:0%
first time didn't get an offer didn't
 
06:31:19.270 --> 06:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
get anything from them throughout the
 
06:31:22.190 --> 06:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
whole ambulance Summit and it sounds
 
06:31:26.150 --> 06:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
very much like the amendment which um we
 
06:31:29.388 --> 06:31:29.398 align:start position:0%
had talked about as a number and
 
06:31:31.430 --> 06:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
dismissed because it takes away the
 
06:31:34.030 --> 06:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
ability to balance bill which we all
 
06:31:37.110 --> 06:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
want to get rid of however it doesn't
 
06:31:39.670 --> 06:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
quantify the amount of money that the
 
06:31:41.868 --> 06:31:41.878 align:start position:0%
providers are able to get by balance
 
06:31:44.948 --> 06:31:44.958 align:start position:0%
billing in the addition to the rate
 
06:31:47.548 --> 06:31:47.558 align:start position:0%
structure of the insurance
 
06:31:51.388 --> 06:31:51.398 align:start position:0%
product it knocks it down in some cases
 
06:31:53.708 --> 06:31:53.718 align:start position:0%
significantly for a number of providers
 
06:31:55.948 --> 06:31:55.958 align:start position:0%
by bringing it to
 
06:32:00.468 --> 06:32:00.478 align:start position:0%
200% I would argue or offer that if we
 
06:32:03.310 --> 06:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
left it at the 325 per and did the
 
06:32:05.070 --> 06:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
amendment and still did the study
 
06:32:06.948 --> 06:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
committee with the cost data that that
 
06:32:08.868 --> 06:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
may actually be something that would be
 
06:32:10.948 --> 06:32:10.958 align:start position:0%
palatable to the majority of ambulance
 
06:32:13.468 --> 06:32:13.478 align:start position:0%
providers because it would bring us to a
 
06:32:16.788 --> 06:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
level where we know we could survive and
 
06:32:19.510 --> 06:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
still provide cost data meaningful cost
 
06:32:22.030 --> 06:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
data for the future to look at where we
 
06:32:25.150 --> 06:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
need to be um I would suspect that the
 
06:32:28.708 --> 06:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
insurers as they have all along would
 
06:32:31.670 --> 06:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
vly oppose that including the insurance
 
06:32:35.110 --> 06:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
commission for some reason um but I
 
06:32:36.708 --> 06:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
think that that's something to consider
 
06:32:37.990 --> 06:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that's something that we could
 
06:32:40.190 --> 06:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
possibly live with now we've said this
 
06:32:42.830 --> 06:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
before in the summit hearing and it
 
06:32:45.830 --> 06:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately fell on deaf ears so um
 
06:32:48.388 --> 06:32:48.398 align:start position:0%
and again I'm I'm surmising because I
 
06:32:50.310 --> 06:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
haven't seen this last minute amendment
 
06:32:53.190 --> 06:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
to a Senate bill which is a little
 
06:32:55.468 --> 06:32:55.478 align:start position:0%
strange in a public Hearing in the house
 
06:32:58.110 --> 06:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
but um nonetheless um we're certainly
 
06:33:01.388 --> 06:33:01.398 align:start position:0%
willing as a as a uh as an association
 
06:33:03.510 --> 06:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
to take a look at things because we want
 
06:33:05.910 --> 06:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
this to end to I've been here I've been
 
06:33:09.190 --> 06:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
a paramedic for 40 years next month and
 
06:33:12.110 --> 06:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
I've been here for the last 20 trying to
 
06:33:13.788 --> 06:33:13.798 align:start position:0%
get this thing ended and we still
 
06:33:15.948 --> 06:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
haven't managed to do it and I would
 
06:33:18.708 --> 06:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
love to do that before I retire um so
 
06:33:20.868 --> 06:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
that it's fair and Equitable and people
 
06:33:22.388 --> 06:33:22.398 align:start position:0%
get the ambulance services that they
 
06:33:24.350 --> 06:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
need and they don't sit and linger in
 
06:33:26.230 --> 06:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
hospital beds waiting to be moved in an
 
06:33:28.590 --> 06:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
emergency situation like they are now
 
06:33:30.788 --> 06:33:30.798 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
06:33:33.468 --> 06:33:33.478 align:start position:0%
right I'm happy to take any questions um
 
06:33:36.430 --> 06:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
my testimony was going to be pretty much
 
06:33:37.350 --> 06:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
everything you've already heard and
 
06:33:38.628 --> 06:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
probably what you're going to hear in in
 
06:33:39.868 --> 06:33:39.878 align:start position:0%
in the future and I think you know my
 
06:33:42.788 --> 06:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
position so I'm in deference of time and
 
06:33:44.990 --> 06:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
to the chairman I'm happy to answer any
 
06:33:48.190 --> 06:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative Bros um
 
06:33:51.190 --> 06:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
will the 325 per number be sufficient
 
06:33:54.548 --> 06:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
for the rural ambulance uh services to
 
06:33:56.708 --> 06:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
survive the way that this bill is
 
06:33:59.708 --> 06:33:59.718 align:start position:0%
currently written it takes um there are
 
06:34:01.430 --> 06:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
three rates that Medicare uses there's
 
06:34:03.948 --> 06:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
an urban rate a rural rate and a super
 
06:34:05.590 --> 06:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
rural rate which have multipliers
 
06:34:08.350 --> 06:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
attached to them so um my understanding
 
06:34:12.070 --> 06:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
and I would let Nate Borland from the
 
06:34:14.150 --> 06:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
most super rural ambulance servers that
 
06:34:16.270 --> 06:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
we have in the state at the 45th
 
06:34:19.150 --> 06:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
parallel in colbrook speak to that
 
06:34:20.590 --> 06:34:20.600 align:start position:0%
because he would know much better than I
 
06:34:25.510 --> 06:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
does yes
 
06:34:31.030 --> 06:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
repres basing on your name sorry it's
 
06:34:32.788 --> 06:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
okay representer RoR thanks for taking
 
06:34:34.628 --> 06:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
my question um it was mentioned that
 
06:34:36.750 --> 06:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
there's new cost reporting that the feds
 
06:34:40.510 --> 06:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
have set up and we plan the insurance
 
06:34:41.990 --> 06:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
company plans to use that to get the
 
06:34:44.948 --> 06:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
information how soon do you think a
 
06:34:47.788 --> 06:34:47.798 align:start position:0%
sufficient number of uh reports would be
 
06:34:50.070 --> 06:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
available with that
 
06:34:52.388 --> 06:34:52.398 align:start position:0%
information I believe we are in year
 
06:34:54.948 --> 06:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
four of a five-year cost study report
 
06:34:57.190 --> 06:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
mandatory cost study report to CMS for
 
06:34:58.910 --> 06:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
every ambulance provider in the United
 
06:35:01.430 --> 06:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
States with the ultimate idea being to
 
06:35:04.110 --> 06:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
rebase MediCare at some point and and
 
06:35:06.270 --> 06:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
make it so that it actually does cover
 
06:35:09.590 --> 06:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
the cost um covid like everything else
 
06:35:11.830 --> 06:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
threw a wrench into that and delayed it
 
06:35:13.310 --> 06:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
um but I believe we're in year four of
 
06:35:15.070 --> 06:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
year five now many of the providers in
 
06:35:16.750 --> 06:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
this room have probably probably already
 
06:35:20.468 --> 06:35:20.478 align:start position:0%
done their cost reports I know we have
 
06:35:24.230 --> 06:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you very oh represent
 
06:35:26.788 --> 06:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
M thank Mr chairman thank you for taking
 
06:35:29.910 --> 06:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
my question um what do EMTs and
 
06:35:32.468 --> 06:35:32.478 align:start position:0%
paramedics in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:35:34.388 --> 06:35:34.398 align:start position:0%
get paid I'm I'm hoping it's more than
 
06:35:37.190 --> 06:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
the $7.75 an hour that I first made at
 
06:35:40.670 --> 06:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
Rocky m i I think when you hired me I
 
06:35:43.990 --> 06:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
can only speak for our organization um
 
06:35:46.030 --> 06:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
the minimum starting wage for a basic
 
06:35:47.430 --> 06:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
EMT is
 
06:35:49.868 --> 06:35:49.878 align:start position:0%
about uh and I don't have the Union
 
06:35:51.990 --> 06:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
contract in front of me it's about 21 or
 
06:35:55.868 --> 06:35:55.878 align:start position:0%
$22 an hour um a paramedic starts out
 
06:35:58.910 --> 06:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
around $35 an hour and an
 
06:36:01.310 --> 06:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
aemt um you know makes somewhere in the
 
06:36:05.070 --> 06:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
middle of that probably $25 $26 an hour
 
06:36:07.270 --> 06:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
followup keep asking questions but we
 
06:36:09.270 --> 06:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
want to get out of here at five I think
 
06:36:11.230 --> 06:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
it helps put it in context what what the
 
06:36:12.830 --> 06:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
good this might might do so thank you
 
06:36:14.788 --> 06:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
for the followup uh thanks for taking
 
06:36:16.350 --> 06:36:16.360 align:start position:0%
the followup would would the increase in
 
06:36:19.750 --> 06:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement help those wages you know
 
06:36:21.670 --> 06:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
help the ambulance companies from
 
06:36:22.868 --> 06:36:22.878 align:start position:0%
prevent them from going out of business
 
06:36:24.750 --> 06:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
and help them perhaps increase the wages
 
06:36:26.750 --> 06:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
of these these this staff I believe it
 
06:36:28.750 --> 06:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
would we are we are not immune to the
 
06:36:30.548 --> 06:36:30.558 align:start position:0%
workforce challenges that all of the
 
06:36:33.270 --> 06:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
other health agencies and Public Safety
 
06:36:36.110 --> 06:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
saf agencies I've I think we've got 25
 
06:36:38.310 --> 06:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
or 30 open positions right now great
 
06:36:39.910 --> 06:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
thanks for putting it in
 
06:36:42.190 --> 06:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
context thank you thank you for your
 
06:36:43.510 --> 06:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
time all right chair we'll call in
 
06:36:57.230 --> 06:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:59.388 --> 06:36:59.398 align:start position:0%
Anthem thank you chairman hunt and
 
06:37:01.388 --> 06:37:01.398 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
06:37:02.708 --> 06:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
Sabrina Dunlap I'm director of
 
06:37:05.030 --> 06:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
government relations for
 
06:37:08.190 --> 06:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
Anthem um so I will I will try to keep
 
06:37:11.230 --> 06:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
this quick um I have a few key points
 
06:37:13.548 --> 06:37:13.558 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make so we're opposed to S
 
06:37:13.558 --> 06:37:14.310 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make so we're opposed to S
SP

06:37:14.310 --> 06:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
SP
 
06:37:16.628 --> 06:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
407 um and on a process issue I just
 
06:37:19.230 --> 06:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
want to respond if I could um to the
 
06:37:21.830 --> 06:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
comment that carriers had not made an
 
06:37:23.670 --> 06:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
offer until after the senate had already
 
06:37:25.548 --> 06:37:25.558 align:start position:0%
passed the bill just as a point of
 
06:37:27.590 --> 06:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
clarification on process the original
 
06:37:30.830 --> 06:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that had a hearing um was
 
06:37:32.510 --> 06:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
very different from the bill that's
 
06:37:34.708 --> 06:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
before you it really addressed this
 
06:37:37.030 --> 06:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
direct pay concept and then after the
 
06:37:39.030 --> 06:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
hearing there were some conversations
 
06:37:42.270 --> 06:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes but we did not see an
 
06:37:45.270 --> 06:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
amendment until it was in Senate HHS in
 
06:37:47.070 --> 06:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
an executive session so we actually this
 
06:37:49.110 --> 06:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
is the first time we've gotten to
 
06:37:51.990 --> 06:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
discuss publicly this concept of
 
06:37:56.190 --> 06:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
325 of Medicare so in fact we had heard
 
06:37:58.270 --> 06:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
that there could be something coming
 
06:37:59.788 --> 06:37:59.798 align:start position:0%
down the pike in the Senate closer to
 
06:38:02.510 --> 06:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
400% of Medicare so the carriers with
 
06:38:06.628 --> 06:38:06.638 align:start position:0%
ahip did make a proposal um and I think
 
06:38:08.230 --> 06:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
kidi croll will discuss that but it was
 
06:38:10.510 --> 06:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
much closer to a main model which tries
 
06:38:13.868 --> 06:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
to incentivize ambulances to come in
 
06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
network um in any event I would also say
 
06:38:19.590 --> 06:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
that as someone who was at I think every
 
06:38:21.310 --> 06:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
single ambulance Summit meeting there
 
06:38:23.310 --> 06:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
were many that the insurance department
 
06:38:25.708 --> 06:38:25.718 align:start position:0%
organized we had many
 
06:38:28.430 --> 06:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
discussions my memory is not ever that
 
06:38:30.430 --> 06:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
we discuss something similar to what's
 
06:38:32.510 --> 06:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
before you so speaking for Anthem I
 
06:38:33.628 --> 06:38:33.638 align:start position:0%
think the other carriers would prob we
 
06:38:35.270 --> 06:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
agree we were pretty surprised to see
 
06:38:38.868 --> 06:38:38.878 align:start position:0%
this come forward as um a potential
 
06:38:42.628 --> 06:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
solution um and you know I will I will
 
06:38:46.510 --> 06:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
also comment that um we I think in these
 
06:38:47.868 --> 06:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
discussions the carriers really
 
06:38:50.030 --> 06:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
recognize the unique challenges that
 
06:38:52.750 --> 06:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
ambulances face they they do have you
 
06:38:54.590 --> 06:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
know this sort of distinct slice of
 
06:38:56.868 --> 06:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
healthcare where they have to be 247
 
06:38:58.750 --> 06:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with emergencies I am
 
06:39:00.510 --> 06:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
involved in my local towns municipal
 
06:39:02.548 --> 06:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
government I completely understand the
 
06:39:04.750 --> 06:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
challenges um and also add in the fact
 
06:39:06.468 --> 06:39:06.478 align:start position:0%
that there's a mix of private companies
 
06:39:08.110 --> 06:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
and municipalities I mean that confuses
 
06:39:09.750 --> 06:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
things so it's a very challenging part
 
06:39:11.510 --> 06:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
of healthcare and I think we all
 
06:39:13.310 --> 06:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
recognize that and we all came to those
 
06:39:15.670 --> 06:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
meetings and sat in good faith and tried
 
06:39:17.350 --> 06:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
to Hash this out because it has been a
 
06:39:19.110 --> 06:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
conversation that's been going on for a
 
06:39:21.910 --> 06:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
very long time um but I think it's
 
06:39:24.030 --> 06:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
important to point out that one of the
 
06:39:26.990 --> 06:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
tenants that we keep in mind uh one of
 
06:39:28.750 --> 06:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
the tenants of Managed Care is the
 
06:39:30.948 --> 06:39:30.958 align:start position:0%
concept of networks so while we
 
06:39:32.910 --> 06:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
recognize the challenges facing
 
06:39:36.270 --> 06:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers we also have to keep
 
06:39:38.230 --> 06:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
sight of the importance of networks and
 
06:39:41.670 --> 06:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
I do think that this bill would um
 
06:39:44.350 --> 06:39:44.360 align:start position:0%
incentivize carriers to not only not
 
06:39:46.468 --> 06:39:46.478 align:start position:0%
come in network but also to potentially
 
06:39:48.830 --> 06:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
leave Network we do have a significant
 
06:39:50.510 --> 06:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
number of ambulance providers in network
 
06:39:52.708 --> 06:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
Anthem does in New Hampshire um and I
 
06:39:54.230 --> 06:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
think what this bill would do is really
 
06:39:57.670 --> 06:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
set kind of a default rate of 325 per of
 
06:40:01.468 --> 06:40:01.478 align:start position:0%
Medicare um and so I think that is a
 
06:40:05.430 --> 06:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
risk um I think that this undermines the
 
06:40:07.230 --> 06:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
concept of networks and really takes us
 
06:40:10.150 --> 06:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
in the wrong direction um and I also
 
06:40:11.868 --> 06:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
would just say I don't think this bill
 
06:40:14.190 --> 06:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
is good for our members it's not good
 
06:40:16.150 --> 06:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
for consumers in New Hampshire there's
 
06:40:18.150 --> 06:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
no ban on balance billing so an
 
06:40:19.750 --> 06:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance provider can still charge
 
06:40:22.548 --> 06:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
whatever they want above and beyond 325
 
06:40:24.868 --> 06:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
of Medicare they will get that payment
 
06:40:27.388 --> 06:40:27.398 align:start position:0%
from insurance companies and then
 
06:40:29.150 --> 06:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
members could potentially be on the hook
 
06:40:32.070 --> 06:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
for whatever else the ambulance charges
 
06:40:34.510 --> 06:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think this this really at the
 
06:40:36.868 --> 06:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
end of the day it's going to serve yes
 
06:40:38.310 --> 06:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
it's a floor of
 
06:40:40.948 --> 06:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
325 that's going to serve as really
 
06:40:43.788 --> 06:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
functionally a mandate of reimbursements
 
06:40:46.590 --> 06:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
being set at 325 per of Medicare that is
 
06:40:48.150 --> 06:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
going to drive up costs for all
 
06:40:50.030 --> 06:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
consumers I you heard the insurance
 
06:40:51.750 --> 06:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
department say I think it was over $4
 
06:40:53.628 --> 06:40:53.638 align:start position:0%
per member per month that is a
 
06:40:56.750 --> 06:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
significant cost increase um so I think
 
06:40:58.070 --> 06:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know this takes us in the wrong
 
06:41:00.590 --> 06:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
direction in terms of building our
 
06:41:02.350 --> 06:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
networks I don't think this is good for
 
06:41:03.990 --> 06:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
consumers and certainly not good for our
 
06:41:05.548 --> 06:41:05.558 align:start position:0%
members so thank you very much for
 
06:41:07.070 --> 06:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
letting me testify and I'm happy to take
 
06:41:07.080 --> 06:41:08.030 align:start position:0%
letting me testify and I'm happy to take
any

06:41:08.030 --> 06:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:41:10.948 --> 06:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative Sullivan has a
 
06:41:13.590 --> 06:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you so I'm just I'm just
 
06:41:15.310 --> 06:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
kind of curious now
 
06:41:18.270 --> 06:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
so certain towns or certain ambulance
 
06:41:21.468 --> 06:41:21.478 align:start position:0%
services aren't actually in your network
 
06:41:24.868 --> 06:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
so what is the solution in your mind
 
06:41:26.830 --> 06:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
then if somebody comes into a town
 
06:41:28.270 --> 06:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
that's not in your network and then they
 
06:41:30.070 --> 06:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
have some sort of emergency they get
 
06:41:32.270 --> 06:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
hurt hiking up where I live or skiing at
 
06:41:33.990 --> 06:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
Canon which is in myct district and
 
06:41:36.670 --> 06:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
suddenly now that ambulance they can't
 
06:41:39.350 --> 06:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
say no to them they can't reject them
 
06:41:42.708 --> 06:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
and like like this seems like a real
 
06:41:44.868 --> 06:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
problem and I get what you're
 
06:41:46.990 --> 06:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
saying I mean it's not falling on dep
 
06:41:48.948 --> 06:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
ears I feel you like it seems like
 
06:41:50.548 --> 06:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
people probably will move out of network
 
06:41:53.590 --> 06:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
at some level and maybe take the 350% or
 
06:41:55.868 --> 06:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
whatever it is but like like what is
 
06:41:57.388 --> 06:41:57.398 align:start position:0%
your solution just let ambulance
 
06:41:58.868 --> 06:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
companies continue to lose money because
 
06:42:00.628 --> 06:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
they're required to cover things and you
 
06:42:01.910 --> 06:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
guys don't want to pay as much as
 
06:42:03.590 --> 06:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
necessary like I don't get what solution
 
06:42:05.628 --> 06:42:05.638 align:start position:0%
is here no I don't think that solution
 
06:42:07.150 --> 06:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
is the solution I don't think any of the
 
06:42:08.548 --> 06:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
carriers have said that this whole time
 
06:42:10.070 --> 06:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question I think
 
06:42:12.270 --> 06:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
you're getting at the very difficult
 
06:42:13.670 --> 06:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
thorny issues we've been trying to deal
 
06:42:15.868 --> 06:42:15.878 align:start position:0%
with currently if an ambulance is out of
 
06:42:18.750 --> 06:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
network um obviously we want our members
 
06:42:21.270 --> 06:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
to have access to ambulances I you know
 
06:42:23.548 --> 06:42:23.558 align:start position:0%
in my town we have made the commitment
 
06:42:25.788 --> 06:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
that we will pay for 247 ambulance these
 
06:42:27.628 --> 06:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
are decisions communities make Anthem
 
06:42:29.070 --> 06:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
wants our members to have access to
 
06:42:31.150 --> 06:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
ambulance so we recognize there's an
 
06:42:32.628 --> 06:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
issue I don't think this bill is the
 
06:42:35.270 --> 06:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
solution but to your question in that
 
06:42:36.948 --> 06:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
case you know the ambulance company
 
06:42:39.788 --> 06:42:39.798 align:start position:0%
would send a bill to Anthem and we would
 
06:42:41.350 --> 06:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
pay the allowed amount for an out of
 
06:42:43.590 --> 06:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
network provider if the ambulance was in
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
network that amount would be higher and
 
06:42:47.990 --> 06:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to haggle around you
 
06:42:49.430 --> 06:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
know them not having a contractual
 
06:42:50.628 --> 06:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
relationship with us that's part of the
 
06:42:52.430 --> 06:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
other challenge is out of network
 
06:42:54.670 --> 06:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
ambulances we have no relationship with
 
06:42:56.310 --> 06:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
them we have no contractual relationship
 
06:42:58.030 --> 06:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
with them that is why we want them to be
 
06:42:59.910 --> 06:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
in network so we have a relationship
 
06:43:01.628 --> 06:43:01.638 align:start position:0%
with them and it's better for our
 
06:43:03.830 --> 06:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
members F the question
 
06:43:07.548 --> 06:43:07.558 align:start position:0%
inquire so what is the reasoning why
 
06:43:09.070 --> 06:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't know and if you don't
 
06:43:10.548 --> 06:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
that's fine but what is the reasoning
 
06:43:12.990 --> 06:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
why a town would not want to be in
 
06:43:14.190 --> 06:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
network if you're telling me that they
 
06:43:15.510 --> 06:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
would get paid is it just a really
 
06:43:17.548 --> 06:43:17.558 align:start position:0%
burdensome process to become in network
 
06:43:19.548 --> 06:43:19.558 align:start position:0%
and so it's like these small towns of a
 
06:43:21.350 --> 06:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
thousand people just can't do it like
 
06:43:22.628 --> 06:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
what there has to be a reason if you
 
06:43:25.190 --> 06:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
could make more money being in network I
 
06:43:26.628 --> 06:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
think it's a very good question and I'm
 
06:43:28.750 --> 06:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
not part of our Contracting networking
 
06:43:31.388 --> 06:43:31.398 align:start position:0%
team but what I I'm guessing is and I
 
06:43:33.468 --> 06:43:33.478 align:start position:0%
know for a fact that our Anthem team is
 
06:43:34.948 --> 06:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
we are constantly making an effort to
 
06:43:37.110 --> 06:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
bring more municipalities and providers
 
06:43:40.190 --> 06:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
in network I think that New Hampshire
 
06:43:43.030 --> 06:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
has so many small towns you have rural
 
06:43:44.910 --> 06:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
areas and I think it is difficult I
 
06:43:46.628 --> 06:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
think that you have to it requires
 
06:43:48.430 --> 06:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
coming to the table and entering into a
 
06:43:50.830 --> 06:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
contract you know and and there are
 
06:43:52.510 --> 06:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
certain requirements to be in network
 
06:43:53.948 --> 06:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
for the protection and benefit of our
 
06:43:56.310 --> 06:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
members and so I think there there might
 
06:43:58.310 --> 06:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
be some resistance to that I don't
 
06:44:01.708 --> 06:44:01.718 align:start position:0%
really know the answer thank you did I
 
06:44:03.548 --> 06:44:03.558 align:start position:0%
see represent Miku
 
06:44:04.548 --> 06:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:44:06.070 --> 06:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question is your town in
 
06:44:08.030 --> 06:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
network and like what percentage of the
 
06:44:10.788 --> 06:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
calls do do you guys represent so I'm
 
06:44:13.548 --> 06:44:13.558 align:start position:0%
not here on behalf of my town so I I
 
06:44:16.030 --> 06:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak on behalf of the
 
06:44:18.510 --> 06:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
Hopkin and select board so I won't um
 
06:44:21.030 --> 06:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
but I do think I believe our town is in
 
06:44:21.040 --> 06:44:22.670 align:start position:0%
but I do think I believe our town is in
network

06:44:22.670 --> 06:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
network
 
06:44:27.788 --> 06:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
yes what percentage though of of what
 
06:44:30.948 --> 06:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
percentage do you represent of of calls
 
06:44:34.270 --> 06:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
of of all like ambulance business Anthem
 
06:44:35.990 --> 06:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
or commercial insurance I don't know the
 
06:44:38.310 --> 06:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
answer to that um but I will say I think
 
06:44:39.948 --> 06:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
this brings up another important point
 
06:44:41.110 --> 06:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
that I think others will probably speak
 
06:44:43.190 --> 06:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
to which is we're talking about a big
 
06:44:45.110 --> 06:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
problem and when we're talking about
 
06:44:46.750 --> 06:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
just commercial insurance and again the
 
06:44:47.990 --> 06:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
fully insured Market you're talking
 
06:44:50.510 --> 06:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
about a tiny sliver of of who we're
 
06:44:52.590 --> 06:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
covering in the state so I think I think
 
06:44:55.590 --> 06:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
this Bill gets at sort of the wrong
 
06:44:57.190 --> 06:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
group for the solution I think we're
 
06:44:59.910 --> 06:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
part of the solution but this bill only
 
06:45:01.350 --> 06:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
goes after commercial insurance and
 
06:45:02.708 --> 06:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
fully insured people which is a very
 
06:45:05.868 --> 06:45:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:10.990 --> 06:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
state okay yeah representa ton
 
06:45:14.430 --> 06:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
so an objection or a sticking point here
 
06:45:17.230 --> 06:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
that I have been going all around this
 
06:45:21.030 --> 06:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill is this uh subject of
 
06:45:25.590 --> 06:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
U balance billing and I have trouble
 
06:45:28.150 --> 06:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
understanding living in the rural part
 
06:45:30.070 --> 06:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the state or semi- rural depending
 
06:45:33.270 --> 06:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
upon where you are why there wouldn't
 
06:45:34.868 --> 06:45:34.878 align:start position:0%
and maybe this isn't how the billing
 
06:45:37.628 --> 06:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
works for an ambulance but I can
 
06:45:41.110 --> 06:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
understand the floor being the 300% of
 
06:45:43.548 --> 06:45:43.558 align:start position:0%
the Medicare rate but if I have to go up
 
06:45:45.788 --> 06:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
two miles up a class six Road and haul a
 
06:45:49.788 --> 06:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
300 P 300 PB man out of a building and
 
06:45:52.070 --> 06:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
then back down again that's got to cost
 
06:45:55.510 --> 06:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
me more than stopping in an apartment
 
06:45:57.150 --> 06:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
building in a
 
06:45:59.590 --> 06:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
garden apartment complex that's a half a
 
06:46:02.110 --> 06:46:02.120 align:start position:0%
mile from the hospital so I would assume
 
06:46:03.590 --> 06:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's where the balance billing comes
 
06:46:05.990 --> 06:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
in is it unreasonable to Bill that
 
06:46:09.270 --> 06:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
person that's my question thank you for
 
06:46:10.468 --> 06:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
the question I I don't know how to
 
06:46:12.910 --> 06:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
answer that exactly except I think this
 
06:46:14.430 --> 06:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
sort of gets at another one of the
 
06:46:15.910 --> 06:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions we really tried to tackle
 
06:46:17.910 --> 06:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
during those ambulance Summit meetings
 
06:46:20.190 --> 06:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
was let's get at why certain ambulance
 
06:46:22.270 --> 06:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
Rides cost so much and it it probably is
 
06:46:24.310 --> 06:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
a result of you have certain situations
 
06:46:25.868 --> 06:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
that are more money and certain
 
06:46:27.468 --> 06:46:27.478 align:start position:0%
situations that are easier and cost less
 
06:46:30.510 --> 06:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
money but I I think it the balance
 
06:46:32.350 --> 06:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
billing piece is very tough for members
 
06:46:35.070 --> 06:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
because they get stuck with that bill
 
06:46:37.430 --> 06:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
and that bill is coming from the
 
06:46:39.430 --> 06:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
ambulance so there's a reason other
 
06:46:41.230 --> 06:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
states have banned balance billing
 
06:46:45.868 --> 06:46:45.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:48.070 --> 06:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
consumers right I mean let's let's face
 
06:46:51.388 --> 06:46:51.398 align:start position:0%
it the uh even with the fact that this
 
06:46:53.310 --> 06:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
amendment this bill as we have coming
 
06:46:55.510 --> 06:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
over still does not remove balance
 
06:46:58.910 --> 06:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
billing is that that that they that the
 
06:47:00.468 --> 06:47:00.478 align:start position:0%
whole reason we're here the whole reason
 
06:47:02.150 --> 06:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
this has occurred it was around the
 
06:47:04.830 --> 06:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
balance billing issue okay and that the
 
06:47:06.670 --> 06:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
issue would be was that the ambulance
 
06:47:08.430 --> 06:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
are saying is you're never going to you
 
06:47:10.270 --> 06:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
know we're you know if we're in a fee
 
06:47:11.990 --> 06:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
for service which is where our health
 
06:47:14.548 --> 06:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
care is fee for service um we're never
 
06:47:16.548 --> 06:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
going to we can't get what we really
 
06:47:18.788 --> 06:47:18.798 align:start position:0%
need which is to pay for our people to
 
06:47:21.628 --> 06:47:21.638 align:start position:0%
be hanging around waiting to service and
 
06:47:25.310 --> 06:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
so therefore they have uh resisted um
 
06:47:27.150 --> 06:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
any resolution here and you can see even
 
06:47:28.670 --> 06:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
with this bill if there if the balance
 
06:47:30.510 --> 06:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
billing is still in this bill it really
 
06:47:33.030 --> 06:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
had never solved the ultimate problem
 
06:47:35.750 --> 06:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay and that if the ultimate problem is
 
06:47:37.548 --> 06:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
that they need more money you know in
 
06:47:39.110 --> 06:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
terms of paying you know they're getting
 
06:47:41.510 --> 06:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
the services what I would challenge is
 
06:47:43.270 --> 06:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
and I will ask you those of you who are
 
06:47:46.110 --> 06:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
in this crowd um you know if those of
 
06:47:48.468 --> 06:47:48.478 align:start position:0%
you who have employers that are greater
 
06:47:51.788 --> 06:47:51.798 align:start position:0%
than 100 employees are you telling me
 
06:47:56.070 --> 06:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
that those orisa plans are paying you
 
06:47:58.670 --> 06:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
more is anybody can tell me that Arisa
 
06:48:01.590 --> 06:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
plans are paying more than what the the
 
06:48:03.430 --> 06:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
small employer insurance
 
06:48:06.708 --> 06:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
because if they're not I want to ask you
 
06:48:09.350 --> 06:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
how would you like it if I told you
 
06:48:11.750 --> 06:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to hit you with with $4 you
 
06:48:15.388 --> 06:48:15.398 align:start position:0%
know was it $36 whatever we're you're
 
06:48:17.590 --> 06:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
going to pay more health
 
06:48:19.750 --> 06:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
insurance and it's only because you're
 
06:48:21.388 --> 06:48:21.398 align:start position:0%
in the small group
 
06:48:23.468 --> 06:48:23.478 align:start position:0%
Market only because you're in the small
 
06:48:25.230 --> 06:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
group Market you're going to pay it if
 
06:48:27.030 --> 06:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
you can't tell me that a large employers
 
06:48:29.310 --> 06:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
are not paying more then I think you're
 
06:48:32.788 --> 06:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
crazy not to take the the the uh
 
06:48:35.230 --> 06:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
solution offer by the department it's a
 
06:48:37.190 --> 06:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
compromise and me that's way you didn't
 
06:48:38.708 --> 06:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
get it you got to take something and get
 
06:48:42.070 --> 06:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
going because otherwise you know this
 
06:48:45.388 --> 06:48:45.398 align:start position:0%
whole issue of holding off for balance
 
06:48:48.830 --> 06:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
billing was based upon you wanted to get
 
06:48:52.548 --> 06:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
fully paid and that is understandable
 
06:48:55.750 --> 06:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
but at this point in time if if you w
 
06:48:57.868 --> 06:48:57.878 align:start position:0%
expected to think you hit Independent
 
06:48:59.430 --> 06:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
Insurance a small employer in health
 
06:49:02.708 --> 06:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
insurance and say oh tag you're it
 
06:49:03.868 --> 06:49:03.878 align:start position:0%
you're the one that's got to pay up the
 
06:49:05.350 --> 06:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
difference the $1
 
06:49:08.910 --> 06:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
million come on it's not
 
06:49:11.548 --> 06:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
fair any more
 
06:49:14.628 --> 06:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
06:49:18.788 --> 06:49:18.798 align:start position:0%

06:49:51.628 --> 06:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
of Peterborough I've been active in the
 
06:49:53.548 --> 06:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
fire and Emergency Medical Services for
 
06:49:55.788 --> 06:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
over 40 years 14 of which have spent
 
06:49:57.468 --> 06:49:57.478 align:start position:0%
leading municipal fire departments with
 
06:49:59.788 --> 06:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
a transport ambulance I'm here today to
 
06:50:02.190 --> 06:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
urge you to support Senate Bill 407 and
 
06:50:04.310 --> 06:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
act rela to pay for ambulance services
 
06:50:05.788 --> 06:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
which seeks to compel insurance
 
06:50:07.750 --> 06:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
companies to pay ambulance services
 
06:50:10.230 --> 06:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
directly and sets a minimum payment or
 
06:50:11.708 --> 06:50:11.718 align:start position:0%
floor as it's been referred to for
 
06:50:14.110 --> 06:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in the state town of
 
06:50:15.910 --> 06:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
Peterboro ambulance provides emergency
 
06:50:17.990 --> 06:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
Transport service to over 13,000

06:50:22.190 --> 06:50:22.200 align:start position:0%

Community Hospital a critical access
 
06:50:26.350 --> 06:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
Hospital located within our community
 
06:50:28.190 --> 06:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
last year we transported
 
06:50:31.310 --> 06:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
1,494 patients in the past three years
 
06:50:33.388 --> 06:50:33.398 align:start position:0%
we have transported a total of 212
 
06:50:35.110 --> 06:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
patients that were paid to Patient
 
06:50:36.510 --> 06:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
totaling over
 
06:50:39.670 --> 06:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
$423,000 in charges these charges take
 
06:50:42.510 --> 06:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
an average of 133 days for us to recover
 
06:50:44.230 --> 06:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
significantly longer than is typical for
 
06:50:47.030 --> 06:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
direct payments more importantly the pay
 
06:50:48.590 --> 06:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
to Patient method of reimbursement to
 
06:50:50.548 --> 06:50:50.558 align:start position:0%
Ence providers is confusing and
 
06:50:53.510 --> 06:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
stressful to our patients an individual
 
06:50:55.150 --> 06:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
who has experienced an accident or
 
06:50:57.350 --> 06:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
medical emergency is often not able to
 
06:50:59.910 --> 06:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
easily manage the barrage of bills and
 
06:51:01.948 --> 06:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
payments they're not always aware of
 
06:51:03.788 --> 06:51:03.798 align:start position:0%
what specific payment is intended to
 
06:51:05.590 --> 06:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
cover of what Bill a specific payment is
 
06:51:07.830 --> 06:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
intended to cover on multiple occasions
 
06:51:09.628 --> 06:51:09.638 align:start position:0%
we have been forced to take individuals
 
06:51:11.388 --> 06:51:11.398 align:start position:0%
we have been transported to small claims
 
06:51:13.868 --> 06:51:13.878 align:start position:0%
court in an attempt to secure payment
 
06:51:16.030 --> 06:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
payment that was paid to them directly
 
06:51:18.310 --> 06:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
by their insurance company specifically
 
06:51:20.230 --> 06:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
for the ambulance charge and not turned
 
06:51:22.910 --> 06:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
over to us the second area addressed by
 
06:51:24.270 --> 06:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is the establishment of a
 
06:51:25.548 --> 06:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate for medically
 
06:51:28.030 --> 06:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
necessary ambulance services during the
 
06:51:29.628 --> 06:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
past decade we have seen the percentage
 
06:51:31.510 --> 06:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
of original charge paid by primary
 
06:51:35.030 --> 06:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance fall from 43% to 33% while the
 
06:51:36.670 --> 06:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
cost to deliver those Services has
 
06:51:38.708 --> 06:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
significantly increased although
 
06:51:40.350 --> 06:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in our service communities
 
06:51:42.350 --> 06:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
contribute to the operating budget we
 
06:51:44.388 --> 06:51:44.398 align:start position:0%
rely heavily on patient billing Revenue
 
06:51:46.830 --> 06:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
to fund the service the establishment of
 
06:51:49.310 --> 06:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
this minimum rate at 325 per of the
 
06:51:51.150 --> 06:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
Medicare rate or the community
 
06:51:53.150 --> 06:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
established rate whichever is lower
 
06:51:55.110 --> 06:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
would provide a basis for reimbursement
 
06:51:57.230 --> 06:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
that more closely represents the cost of
 
06:51:59.510 --> 06:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
service delivery it will shift a larger
 
06:52:01.310 --> 06:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
portion of those costs away from the
 
06:52:03.510 --> 06:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayer and back back to those who are
 
06:52:06.468 --> 06:52:06.478 align:start position:0%
receiving the services Senate Bill 407
 
06:52:08.628 --> 06:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
if enacted would greatly ease the burden
 
06:52:10.110 --> 06:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
of patients sorting out bills and
 
06:52:11.830 --> 06:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
payments and help to ensure that
 
06:52:13.670 --> 06:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
ambulance services are receiving
 
06:52:15.510 --> 06:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
Insurance reimbursements in a timely
 
06:52:17.590 --> 06:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
fashion and representative the cost to
 
06:52:21.310 --> 06:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:25.230 --> 06:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
Services thank you very much oh we do we
 
06:52:27.230 --> 06:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
have a question I have a
 
06:52:30.590 --> 06:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
question why do you not want to be in
 
06:52:33.110 --> 06:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
network I mean Pro I I don't know if you
 
06:52:34.788 --> 06:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
all have the same reason but I just
 
06:52:36.590 --> 06:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
don't get
 
06:52:39.708 --> 06:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
it so one one of the issues being a
 
06:52:42.070 --> 06:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
network is what network do you get into
 
06:52:43.670 --> 06:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'll pick Peterboro as an example
 
06:52:45.868 --> 06:52:45.878 align:start position:0%
Peterboro is a community that has a lot
 
06:52:47.990 --> 06:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
of retirees we have residents coming to
 
06:52:50.590 --> 06:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
us that have we're fortunate um with our
 
06:52:52.910 --> 06:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
payx um but when it comes to getting
 
06:52:55.548 --> 06:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
into Network it's very difficult to
 
06:52:57.548 --> 06:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
figure out what networks to join and the
 
06:53:00.708 --> 06:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
network to go in and despite what the
 
06:53:03.708 --> 06:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
insurance um the Anthem representative
 
06:53:05.868 --> 06:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
said although a number of those folks
 
06:53:08.670 --> 06:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
are paid a larger amount it's not a town
 
06:53:10.830 --> 06:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
of Peterborough that does 1400 ambulance
 
06:53:12.510 --> 06:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
transports year across dozens of
 
06:53:14.350 --> 06:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
insurance companies we don't have the
 
06:53:15.788 --> 06:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
ability to leverage we don't have the
 
06:53:17.990 --> 06:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
ability to negotiate a fair rate a
 
06:53:20.230 --> 06:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
larger Corporation that's doing National
 
06:53:23.190 --> 06:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
transports of patients in you know major
 
06:53:25.670 --> 06:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
metropolitan areas has that leverage we
 
06:53:27.190 --> 06:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
do not nor do a lot of the other
 
06:53:28.708 --> 06:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
providers in this room
 
06:53:30.948 --> 06:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
today I understand we're talking about
 
06:53:32.628 --> 06:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
the small group Market there's there's
 
06:53:35.350 --> 06:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
only Anthem and Harvard there's only two
 
06:53:37.788 --> 06:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
companies if you look at networks
 
06:53:41.190 --> 06:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
nationally we we although this bill only
 
06:53:44.150 --> 06:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
addresses your New Hampshire insurers
 
06:53:46.190 --> 06:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
correct we are pro we are transporting
 
06:53:48.070 --> 06:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
patients that have insurance from all
 
06:53:50.350 --> 06:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
across the nation all kinds of different
 
06:53:52.868 --> 06:53:52.878 align:start position:0%
providers so in terms of networks there
 
06:53:55.510 --> 06:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
are a number of networks we aren't just
 
06:53:58.590 --> 06:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
although we here within this hearing our
 
06:54:00.430 --> 06:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
Focus just upon those commercial
 
06:54:02.948 --> 06:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
insurers in New Hampshire that does not
 
06:54:05.150 --> 06:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
represent all of the people that we
 
06:54:06.750 --> 06:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
transport in ambulance in fact it
 
06:54:08.868 --> 06:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
represents a very small percentage of
 
06:54:14.948 --> 06:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:18.110 --> 06:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
transport question represent spe I don't
 
06:54:20.510 --> 06:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
know who knows the answer to this but I
 
06:54:23.948 --> 06:54:23.958 align:start position:0%
have my local doctor he belongs to I
 
06:54:25.830 --> 06:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't know how many
 
06:54:29.548 --> 06:54:29.558 align:start position:0%
networks surely a doctor that has a
 
06:54:31.708 --> 06:54:31.718 align:start position:0%
small practice or a group of doctors
 
06:54:33.628 --> 06:54:33.638 align:start position:0%
that have a small practice if they're
 
06:54:35.590 --> 06:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
able to handle being in multiple
 
06:54:39.110 --> 06:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
networks I'm not clear on why you can't
 
06:54:40.350 --> 06:54:40.360 align:start position:0%
I think the other one of the other
 
06:54:42.310 --> 06:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
problems you get back to and um the
 
06:54:43.430 --> 06:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Association May able to
 
06:54:45.948 --> 06:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
address this better than I am you select
 
06:54:48.468 --> 06:54:48.478 align:start position:0%
your doctor based upon your network an
 
06:54:50.150 --> 06:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
individual having a medical emergency
 
06:54:52.468 --> 06:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
cannot select their ambulance they can't
 
06:54:54.190 --> 06:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
choose to go Two Towns over to get
 
06:54:55.750 --> 06:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
transported because that ambulance
 
06:54:57.270 --> 06:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
service is in the network that they're a
 
06:54:57.280 --> 06:55:00.150 align:start position:0%
service is in the network that they're a
part

06:55:00.150 --> 06:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:03.830 --> 06:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
of that that's really not quite true
 
06:55:05.990 --> 06:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
right we we select our doctor based on
 
06:55:08.628 --> 06:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
who we know but I know I belong over to
 
06:55:11.310 --> 06:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
the small Clinic over by Harvard
 
06:55:14.388 --> 06:55:14.398 align:start position:0%
Pilgrim they it doesn't make any
 
06:55:16.990 --> 06:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
difference who your insurance is they're
 
06:55:20.350 --> 06:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
in the network I and including Medicare
 
06:55:23.830 --> 06:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
I I'm just not clear on on why you think
 
06:55:25.830 --> 06:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
you can't do that and we're talking
 
06:55:27.110 --> 06:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire we're not talking
 
06:55:28.388 --> 06:55:28.398 align:start position:0%
about the rest of the world we're just
 
06:55:29.830 --> 06:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
talking about New Hampshire because
 
06:55:31.190 --> 06:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's the only place we have control
 
06:55:31.200 --> 06:55:33.788 align:start position:0%
that's the only place we have control
over

06:55:33.788 --> 06:55:33.798 align:start position:0%
over
 
06:55:35.788 --> 06:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
I understand I I it's the only place
 
06:55:37.430 --> 06:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
we've control however it's not the only
 
06:55:40.070 --> 06:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
place that our patients are insured
 
06:55:42.310 --> 06:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
from we're not talking about just the
 
06:55:43.910 --> 06:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
small group employers here we're talking
 
06:55:45.830 --> 06:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
about literally dozens of insurance
 
06:55:47.910 --> 06:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
companies across every state in this
 
06:55:49.708 --> 06:55:49.718 align:start position:0%
country right and what we're trying to
 
06:55:54.030 --> 06:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
tell you is that if it isn't
 
06:55:56.788 --> 06:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
Anthem or
 
06:55:59.350 --> 06:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
Harvard this legislation doesn't affect
 
06:56:04.230 --> 06:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
them this legislation only affects
 
06:56:07.750 --> 06:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
small group small employer
 
06:56:10.708 --> 06:56:10.718 align:start position:0%
Insurance in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:56:12.150 --> 06:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
and that's two
 
06:56:14.948 --> 06:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
companies the one benefit this bill does
 
06:56:16.670 --> 06:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
is establishing that as they're
 
06:56:18.788 --> 06:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
referring to at the floor rate one of
 
06:56:20.830 --> 06:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
the problems that we face on a routine
 
06:56:23.628 --> 06:56:23.638 align:start position:0%
basis is adjudicating claims based upon
 
06:56:24.948 --> 06:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
what is considered to be a fair and
 
06:56:27.350 --> 06:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount for the ambulance bill
 
06:56:29.150 --> 06:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
if the legislature in New Hampshire were
 
06:56:32.750 --> 06:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
to determine that 325 per of Medicare is
 
06:56:35.310 --> 06:56:35.320 align:start position:0%
a reasonable and a fair rate for that
 
06:56:37.150 --> 06:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
emergency ambulance bill it would
 
06:56:38.868 --> 06:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
significantly help us in the educating
 
06:56:41.548 --> 06:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
of those bills as well as justifying
 
06:56:42.788 --> 06:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
that rate when dealing with the
 
06:56:46.708 --> 06:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:46.718 --> 06:56:49.948 align:start position:0%
 
patients

06:56:49.948 --> 06:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:51.868 --> 06:56:51.878 align:start position:0%
okay all right

407 Rel relative to direct pay for

ambulance providers what we had done
 
06:57:59.388 --> 06:57:59.398 align:start position:0%
over the past couple years working with
 
06:58:01.590 --> 06:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
the work group studying this material is
 
06:58:03.310 --> 06:58:03.320 align:start position:0%
we have collected collected data from 42
 
06:58:05.948 --> 06:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
communities representing almost 50,000
 
06:58:07.510 --> 06:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
EMS transports in the state of New
 
06:58:10.070 --> 06:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and weed data that
 
06:58:11.628 --> 06:58:11.638 align:start position:0%
demonstrated the vast majority of
 
06:58:13.548 --> 06:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
communities that provide ambulet
 
06:58:16.150 --> 06:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
services to not recover their costs for
 
06:58:18.388 --> 06:58:18.398 align:start position:0%
providing that service that means the
 
06:58:20.788 --> 06:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
costs born are by the local property
 
06:58:23.110 --> 06:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers we understand what you're
 
06:58:27.150 --> 06:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
wrestling with today and we know that
 
06:58:28.830 --> 06:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of Fire
 
06:58:31.110 --> 06:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
Chiefs has been actively engaged on the
 
06:58:33.110 --> 06:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
work groups to try to address these
 
06:58:35.110 --> 06:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
challenges we're not familiar with the
 
06:58:36.350 --> 06:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that's been brought forward
 
06:58:39.468 --> 06:58:39.478 align:start position:0%
today and but we do know that 200% of
 
06:58:42.110 --> 06:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
Medicare rates is inadequate for a
 
06:58:44.750 --> 06:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
fire-based EMS Transport Service in the
 
06:58:47.868 --> 06:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire the fees that are
 
06:58:49.548 --> 06:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
not covered go back to the balance
 
06:58:51.190 --> 06:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
billing to make the wheels turn for the
 
06:58:53.230 --> 06:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities because it it either goes
 
06:58:54.750 --> 06:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
back to the person who's being
 
06:58:56.270 --> 06:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
transported or the community that runs
 
06:58:58.788 --> 06:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
the EMS service I appreciate your time
 
06:59:01.548 --> 06:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
and consideration um and from the
 
06:59:04.670 --> 06:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
feedback from our members from the fire
 
06:59:06.788 --> 06:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
departments that provide EMS transport
 
06:59:08.788 --> 06:59:08.798 align:start position:0%
service that are not in network they
 
06:59:10.750 --> 06:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
they can't negotiate a rate that covers
 
06:59:13.190 --> 06:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
their services for the Network rates
 
06:59:15.628 --> 06:59:15.638 align:start position:0%
that was the to answer the question that
 
06:59:17.310 --> 06:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
was made earlier about why aren't all
 
06:59:19.708 --> 06:59:19.718 align:start position:0%
the fire departments in the rate in the
 
06:59:21.548 --> 06:59:21.558 align:start position:0%
network they can't afford to do it to
 
06:59:23.548 --> 06:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
cover the community I I'm grateful for
 
06:59:25.788 --> 06:59:25.798 align:start position:0%

appreciate the the late hour that it is
 
07:00:31.150 --> 07:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
um ahip is um opposed to S SP 407 as
 
07:00:32.708 --> 07:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
amended by the sen
 
07:00:34.350 --> 07:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
um and I do appreciate the opportunity
 
07:00:37.388 --> 07:00:37.398 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill um uh the bill
 
07:00:40.548 --> 07:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
was amended amended um substantially um
 
07:00:43.430 --> 07:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
from its uh as introduced version in the
 
07:00:45.310 --> 07:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
Senate but the Amendments uh never did
 
07:00:47.788 --> 07:00:47.798 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing there um there was
 
07:00:49.948 --> 07:00:49.958 align:start position:0%
an amendment in introduced at the time
 
07:00:52.030 --> 07:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
that the Senate HHS had an executive
 
07:00:54.628 --> 07:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
session um that was voted on the same
 
07:00:57.310 --> 07:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
day and um then the bill went to the
 
07:00:58.788 --> 07:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee where it was
 
07:01:00.990 --> 07:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
amended again um also with an amendment
 
07:01:02.948 --> 07:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
introduced uh during the executive
 
07:01:04.670 --> 07:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
session that did not get a a public
 
07:01:07.430 --> 07:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
hearing there as well so and that um
 
07:01:09.190 --> 07:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
carriers had not seen these amendments
 
07:01:11.708 --> 07:01:11.718 align:start position:0%
so um I did have several conversations
 
07:01:13.310 --> 07:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
with the prime sponsor as well as other
 
07:01:15.590 --> 07:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
Senators about the bill um during that
 
07:01:18.788 --> 07:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
period between um the bill being an HHS
 
07:01:20.350 --> 07:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
um and being in Senate Finance but
 
07:01:22.430 --> 07:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
obviously those conversations are not a
 
07:01:24.910 --> 07:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
a substitute for public hearings on a um
 
07:01:28.270 --> 07:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
such very significant amendments um so s
 
07:01:30.468 --> 07:01:30.478 align:start position:0%
SP 407 proposes to take New Hampshire
 
07:01:32.310 --> 07:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
down the path for the first time ever
 
07:01:34.150 --> 07:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
really of local government setting
 
07:01:36.670 --> 07:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum rates for emergency
 
07:01:38.830 --> 07:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance services that carriers would
 
07:01:40.910 --> 07:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
be required to pay and that are
 
07:01:43.030 --> 07:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
effectively set at an arbitrary rate of
 
07:01:47.590 --> 07:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
325 per of Medicare um it's 325 per is
 
07:01:49.270 --> 07:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and then it lacks any New
 
07:01:51.948 --> 07:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific Actuarial or other
 
07:01:54.948 --> 07:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
evidentiary uh Foundation um and in
 
07:01:56.548 --> 07:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
addition to mandating that New Hampshire
 
07:01:58.708 --> 07:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
employers and individuals pay this
 
07:02:01.270 --> 07:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
arbitrary minimum charge of 325 per of
 
07:02:03.830 --> 07:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare enroles in fully insured plans
 
07:02:05.948 --> 07:02:05.958 align:start position:0%
will still be at risk of balance billing
 
07:02:07.468 --> 07:02:07.478 align:start position:0%
because um as you've heard the bill does
 
07:02:10.230 --> 07:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
not ban um that practice so that's a
 
07:02:12.190 --> 07:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
little preview of ahip's um serious
 
07:02:14.230 --> 07:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill um but before I
 
07:02:16.110 --> 07:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
get into the details I wanted to share
 
07:02:18.030 --> 07:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
some important background and context
 
07:02:20.510 --> 07:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
with you um so first of all emergency
 
07:02:23.190 --> 07:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance services do represent a unique
 
07:02:25.310 --> 07:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
intersection between Public Safety and
 
07:02:28.510 --> 07:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
Health Care um both ta taxpayers and the
 
07:02:30.030 --> 07:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
various health insurance payers whether
 
07:02:32.868 --> 07:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
it's Medicaid Medicare commercial plans
 
07:02:34.430 --> 07:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
um should play a role in supporting
 
07:02:37.110 --> 07:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
these Public Services um support should
 
07:02:39.070 --> 07:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
not be expected in our opinion to come
 
07:02:41.830 --> 07:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
exclusively from the various payers um
 
07:02:44.230 --> 07:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers pay for police they pay
 
07:02:46.350 --> 07:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
for fire um and they should share at
 
07:02:48.628 --> 07:02:48.638 align:start position:0%
least some responsibility um for paying
 
07:02:50.788 --> 07:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
for ambulance services as well and I
 
07:02:53.030 --> 07:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
point that out um simply to make sure
 
07:02:54.868 --> 07:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
that uh you know to the extent that
 
07:02:56.948 --> 07:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
people are thinking that 100% of
 
07:02:59.750 --> 07:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance service cost should be paid um
 
07:03:02.270 --> 07:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
simply by Insurance payers um we would
 
07:03:04.708 --> 07:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with that um the
 
07:03:06.230 --> 07:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
second point I want to make is that the
 
07:03:07.670 --> 07:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
highest reimbursement rates that
 
07:03:10.270 --> 07:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers receive today um do
 
07:03:12.590 --> 07:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
come from Private health insurance plans
 
07:03:14.430 --> 07:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
um namely those plans that are paid for
 
07:03:15.708 --> 07:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
by New Hampshire businesses and
 
07:03:18.230 --> 07:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
individual citizens Medicaid Medicare
 
07:03:20.270 --> 07:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
and unassured payers are all paying
 
07:03:23.830 --> 07:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
significantly less than private plans do
 
07:03:25.830 --> 07:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
um third as you know um there are
 
07:03:27.750 --> 07:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
self-funded plans those like what the
 
07:03:30.708 --> 07:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
state offers um uh to its employees and
 
07:03:33.310 --> 07:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
retirees or l employers offer and there
 
07:03:34.990 --> 07:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
are fully insured plans those that
 
07:03:37.350 --> 07:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
individuals and small to midsize
 
07:03:39.788 --> 07:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
employers purchase um from insurance
 
07:03:42.510 --> 07:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
companies and the bill as you know um if
 
07:03:44.150 --> 07:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
you've heard only applies to fully
 
07:03:46.430 --> 07:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
insured plans not to self-funded plans
 
07:03:48.190 --> 07:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
and definitely not to Medicaid or
 
07:03:52.110 --> 07:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
Medicare so um approximately 28% of the
 
07:03:54.590 --> 07:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
market is served by fully insured plans
 
07:03:57.030 --> 07:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the individual employer markets
 
07:03:59.510 --> 07:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 34% is served by
 
07:04:01.388 --> 07:04:01.398 align:start position:0%
self-funded plans and the rest of the
 
07:04:03.868 --> 07:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
market is Medicaid Medicare and other
 
07:04:06.270 --> 07:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
government programs um so as the point
 
07:04:08.070 --> 07:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
has been made um the impacts of this
 
07:04:10.430 --> 07:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill will be borne solely by the New
 
07:04:11.948 --> 07:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens who purchase their
 
07:04:13.430 --> 07:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
health insurance in the individual
 
07:04:15.948 --> 07:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
market and by employers located in New
 
07:04:17.868 --> 07:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that purchase fully insured
 
07:04:20.310 --> 07:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
plans and it again is their plans that
 
07:04:22.468 --> 07:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
are already paying more than Medicaid
 
07:04:25.350 --> 07:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
and Medicare for ambulance services um
 
07:04:26.830 --> 07:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
the fourth point I would like to make is
 
07:04:28.230 --> 07:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department as you've
 
07:04:30.388 --> 07:04:30.398 align:start position:0%
heard did convene um this ambulance
 
07:04:33.150 --> 07:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
Summit um back last late last summer
 
07:04:34.788 --> 07:04:34.798 align:start position:0%
where it pulled together a group of
 
07:04:37.150 --> 07:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um ambulance providers
 
07:04:40.270 --> 07:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
carriers other um others interested um
 
07:04:41.670 --> 07:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
to look at the ambulance uh
 
07:04:44.190 --> 07:04:44.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and the role of the fully
 
07:04:46.750 --> 07:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
insured plans play in that the group met
 
07:04:48.468 --> 07:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
a number of times and also created three
 
07:04:50.350 --> 07:04:50.360 align:start position:0%
or four subgroups that also met a number
 
07:04:52.468 --> 07:04:52.478 align:start position:0%
of times and i' say we probably met at
 
07:04:54.590 --> 07:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
least a dozen times Al together maybe
 
07:04:57.670 --> 07:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
more um and you know not once during
 
07:04:59.548 --> 07:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
that process did the ambulance providers
 
07:05:01.788 --> 07:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
suggest the proposal that is um set
 
07:05:04.590 --> 07:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
forth in s SP 407 it wasn't mentioned it
 
07:05:07.150 --> 07:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't vetted um with that group which
 
07:05:09.110 --> 07:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
was specifically convened for the
 
07:05:11.510 --> 07:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
purpose of exploring different ideas
 
07:05:13.310 --> 07:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
about um ambulance reimbursement by
 
07:05:15.868 --> 07:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
fully insured plans the fifth and final
 
07:05:17.230 --> 07:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
point I would like to make before I get
 
07:05:18.830 --> 07:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
into the details of the bill is that
 
07:05:20.910 --> 07:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
when you look at the types of payers to
 
07:05:22.590 --> 07:05:22.600 align:start position:0%
whom ambulance providers are sending
 
07:05:25.388 --> 07:05:25.398 align:start position:0%
their bills less than 10% of that payer
 
07:05:28.110 --> 07:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
mix is the fully insured market so again
 
07:05:30.230 --> 07:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
less than 10% and I did circulate around
 
07:05:32.948 --> 07:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
a pie chart that shows this um the
 
07:05:35.628 --> 07:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
remaining 90 plus% of the payers that
 
07:05:37.070 --> 07:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
are getting bills from ambulance
 
07:05:40.190 --> 07:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
providers are Medicaid Medicare Tricare
 
07:05:42.430 --> 07:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
the uninsured um with Medicaid and
 
07:05:44.868 --> 07:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
Medicare being the two um biggest um
 
07:05:44.878 --> 07:05:46.030 align:start position:0%
Medicare being the two um biggest um
totaling

07:05:46.030 --> 07:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
totaling
 
07:05:48.230 --> 07:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
77% so I mentioned this because the
 
07:05:49.788 --> 07:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
financial challenges that ambulance
 
07:05:51.830 --> 07:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
providers face is largely driven by the
 
07:05:54.388 --> 07:05:54.398 align:start position:0%
low reimbursement rate from the that
 
07:05:58.430 --> 07:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
largest group of payers um Medicaid and
 
07:06:00.670 --> 07:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare so now I'd like to turn to the
 
07:06:03.670 --> 07:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
specifics of ES B 407 as amended um
 
07:06:06.830 --> 07:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
section one Roman 1 of sb47 requires the
 
07:06:08.750 --> 07:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
carriers to pay ambulance providers
 
07:06:10.830 --> 07:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
directly no sending checks to the
 
07:06:14.070 --> 07:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
patients um as uh to the extent that's
 
07:06:16.310 --> 07:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
even happening anymore um carriers are
 
07:06:18.910 --> 07:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
not opposed to that provision um and as
 
07:06:20.670 --> 07:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
you know that's a statutory provision
 
07:06:23.510 --> 07:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
also accomplished in House Bill 1081
 
07:06:26.230 --> 07:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
which you um passed here passed out of
 
07:06:29.468 --> 07:06:29.478 align:start position:0%
committee um and is now in the Senate uh
 
07:06:32.230 --> 07:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
Senate HHS committee um
 
07:06:34.190 --> 07:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
section one Roman one of of the bill
 
07:06:35.948 --> 07:06:35.958 align:start position:0%
also requires carriers to pay out of
 
07:06:37.590 --> 07:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
network ambulance providers for
 
07:06:40.270 --> 07:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
emergency transports at either rate set
 
07:06:42.670 --> 07:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
by the local government um or contracted
 
07:06:45.388 --> 07:06:45.398 align:start position:0%
entity subject to a public process or
 
07:06:48.708 --> 07:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
325 per of medicare's rates whichever is
 
07:06:51.788 --> 07:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
less um our concern is that this new
 
07:06:53.788 --> 07:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
mandate would insert um government
 
07:06:55.628 --> 07:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
intervention and really local government
 
07:06:57.310 --> 07:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
intervention into private contract
 
07:06:59.468 --> 07:06:59.478 align:start position:0%
negotiations between carriers and
 
07:07:01.830 --> 07:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers and establish uh
 
07:07:04.270 --> 07:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
Government rate setting um in Private
 
07:07:05.670 --> 07:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
health insurance really for the first
 
07:07:08.230 --> 07:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
time in New Hampshire um the Practical
 
07:07:10.388 --> 07:07:10.398 align:start position:0%
effect we think of this bill will be a
 
07:07:12.670 --> 07:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
government imposed minimum charge
 
07:07:15.868 --> 07:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
mandate set at 325 per of Medicare and I
 
07:07:16.910 --> 07:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
think actually you've heard that from
 
07:07:19.868 --> 07:07:19.878 align:start position:0%
some of the providers as well um and so
 
07:07:21.030 --> 07:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
what will happen is that any
 
07:07:23.070 --> 07:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
municipality whose emergency ambulance
 
07:07:25.868 --> 07:07:25.878 align:start position:0%
charges are currently below 325 per of
 
07:07:28.868 --> 07:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
Medicare We Believe will raise their
 
07:07:32.350 --> 07:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
their charges to equal 325 ofic care the
 
07:07:35.030 --> 07:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
reason is simple um they will not want
 
07:07:37.750 --> 07:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
to leave money on the table um if that
 
07:07:39.788 --> 07:07:39.798 align:start position:0%
law if the law allows them to collect
 
07:07:44.150 --> 07:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
charges set at 325 per. um they may
 
07:07:46.070 --> 07:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
increase their charges um to pay for new
 
07:07:49.190 --> 07:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
equipment new staff um benefits or the
 
07:07:50.948 --> 07:07:50.958 align:start position:0%
like but the point is that there will be
 
07:07:53.788 --> 07:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
you know um no incentive to uh contain
 
07:07:58.590 --> 07:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
cost below the 325 per um Mark Benchmark
 
07:08:00.990 --> 07:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
um we're also concerned that the local
 
07:08:04.708 --> 07:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
rates will shift um will will result in
 
07:08:06.788 --> 07:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
cost shifting onto fully insured plans
 
07:08:08.388 --> 07:08:08.398 align:start position:0%
which again are the part that's less
 
07:08:10.590 --> 07:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
than 10% of the ambulance providers
 
07:08:14.190 --> 07:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
service base um as I mentioned earlier
 
07:08:17.468 --> 07:08:17.478 align:start position:0%
um and so it's those premium payers will
 
07:08:19.350 --> 07:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
be left and our Our concern is left
 
07:08:22.030 --> 07:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
subsidizing Medicare and Medicaid um and
 
07:08:23.990 --> 07:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
the other government group programs um
 
07:08:25.190 --> 07:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
through higher premiums higher
 
07:08:28.230 --> 07:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
deductibles or higher cost sharing um
 
07:08:29.750 --> 07:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
and when people are in their deductible
 
07:08:31.548 --> 07:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
phase of their insurance they will will
 
07:08:34.990 --> 07:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
be paying the 325 of Medicaid directly
 
07:08:36.868 --> 07:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
um again with no protection against
 
07:08:36.878 --> 07:08:37.788 align:start position:0%
um again with no protection against
balance

07:08:37.788 --> 07:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
balance
 
07:08:41.388 --> 07:08:41.398 align:start position:0%
billing um another effect of this bill
 
07:08:43.190 --> 07:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
is that any ambulance provider who is
 
07:08:45.670 --> 07:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
currently in necor getting reimbursed um
 
07:08:48.628 --> 07:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
pursuant to uh the negotiated rates um
 
07:08:50.510 --> 07:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
will likely seek rates that are above
 
07:08:53.990 --> 07:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
325 per of Medicare um as a condition of
 
07:08:55.708 --> 07:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
staying in network otherwise they will
 
07:08:57.868 --> 07:08:57.878 align:start position:0%
just leave the network um and go get
 
07:09:00.430 --> 07:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
paid 325 of Medicare and retain the
 
07:09:02.468 --> 07:09:02.478 align:start position:0%
ability to B balance Bill the patient so
 
07:09:04.150 --> 07:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
again if you're in network you're
 
07:09:06.750 --> 07:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited by state law to balance Bill
 
07:09:09.510 --> 07:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
if you're out of a network um they have
 
07:09:11.948 --> 07:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
the ability to balance bill um so that
 
07:09:13.750 --> 07:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
could be another incentive that's
 
07:09:16.868 --> 07:09:16.878 align:start position:0%
keeping um the providers out of network
 
07:09:19.190 --> 07:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and I had initially thought that this
 
07:09:21.750 --> 07:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
applied only to outof network providers
 
07:09:24.510 --> 07:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
but um there's some language in here um
 
07:09:27.190 --> 07:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
in particular on lines 14 and 15 which
 
07:09:29.468 --> 07:09:29.478 align:start position:0%
makes me think and it says or according
 
07:09:32.150 --> 07:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
to the participating ambulance providers
 
07:09:34.388 --> 07:09:34.398 align:start position:0%
build charges whichever is the lesser
 
07:09:37.350 --> 07:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
amount so I think that somehow um the in
 
07:09:38.910 --> 07:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
network providers are also getting
 
07:09:42.230 --> 07:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
pulled into this and um allow to have
 
07:09:45.160 --> 07:09:45.170 align:start position:0%
their charges or 325 per.
 
07:09:45.170 --> 07:09:47.270 align:start position:0%
their charges or 325 per.
[Music]

07:09:47.270 --> 07:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
07:09:51.590 --> 07:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
um finally Our concern is um if you pass
 
07:09:53.388 --> 07:09:53.398 align:start position:0%
this bill we are concerned that starting
 
07:09:56.430 --> 07:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
next year it's potentially uh or maybe
 
07:09:58.270 --> 07:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
even quite likely the other providers in
 
07:10:00.150 --> 07:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from large Hospital
 
07:10:01.990 --> 07:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
Systems down to small providers will
 
07:10:03.910 --> 07:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature looking for
 
07:10:06.070 --> 07:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
state government to guarantee them a
 
07:10:10.468 --> 07:10:10.478 align:start position:0%
minimum of 25% of Medicare as well
 
07:10:13.270 --> 07:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
um we've heard we've talked about um the
 
07:10:16.910 --> 07:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
fact that 325 per is arbitrary um so
 
07:10:19.788 --> 07:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
I'll uh skip over that
 
07:10:22.190 --> 07:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
um and just would like to emphasize that
 
07:10:23.628 --> 07:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
you know nowhere else in New Hampshire's
 
07:10:25.830 --> 07:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
commercial health insurance markets our
 
07:10:29.030 --> 07:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
providers guaranteed a statutory rate
 
07:10:30.388 --> 07:10:30.398 align:start position:0%
guarantee where they can you know
 
07:10:33.030 --> 07:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
essentially demand be paid a minimum of
 
07:10:35.708 --> 07:10:35.718 align:start position:0%
325 of Medicare and the carriers have to
 
07:10:38.110 --> 07:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
pay it um and that really becomes a
 
07:10:42.830 --> 07:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
ceiling uh I mean a floor um not a
 
07:10:46.388 --> 07:10:46.398 align:start position:0%
ceiling um just a few more points um in
 
07:10:49.548 --> 07:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
the Roman three um of this bill it says
 
07:10:51.350 --> 07:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
that in the event of a dispute between
 
07:10:54.350 --> 07:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
the health provider and insurer um uh
 
07:10:56.190 --> 07:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
there's a dispute resolution process
 
07:10:58.670 --> 07:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
which um you know as you heard this
 
07:11:00.868 --> 07:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
morning with s SP 173 that's going to be
 
07:11:02.868 --> 07:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
changed kind of being the state level
 
07:11:05.510 --> 07:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
new hampsh uh no surprises act um and I
 
07:11:07.430 --> 07:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
think it's just a little ironic that um
 
07:11:09.430 --> 07:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
ground ambulance providers have
 
07:11:11.830 --> 07:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
successfully um Exempted themselves or
 
07:11:14.750 --> 07:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
kind of been you know kept out of um
 
07:11:17.388 --> 07:11:17.398 align:start position:0%
advocated to be kept out of the um no
 
07:11:19.468 --> 07:11:19.478 align:start position:0%
surprises act um and we actually
 
07:11:21.670 --> 07:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need s SP 407 if they were
 
07:11:23.750 --> 07:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
included under the federal no surprises
 
07:11:28.030 --> 07:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
act so um it would solve a lot of the a
 
07:11:31.310 --> 07:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
lot of the problems um and of course the
 
07:11:33.468 --> 07:11:33.478 align:start position:0%
surprises act does include a Prohibition
 
07:11:35.230 --> 07:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
on balance
 
07:11:37.910 --> 07:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
billing um I would call your attention
 
07:11:42.948 --> 07:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
to the um the fiscal note in the bill um
 
07:11:44.628 --> 07:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
and I can just quote it quickly here but
 
07:11:47.230 --> 07:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
you've heard you know it's going to 11.8
 
07:11:48.430 --> 07:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
million or
 
07:11:51.628 --> 07:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
$441 per member per month and then the
 
07:11:53.388 --> 07:11:53.398 align:start position:0%
department assumes for Riders would
 
07:11:57.070 --> 07:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
migrate to the 325 per of Medicare rate
 
07:11:59.030 --> 07:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
rather than to negotiate a lower rate
 
07:12:01.548 --> 07:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
and so again that 11.8 million is
 
07:12:04.948 --> 07:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
assuming that the providers get um their
 
07:12:04.958 --> 07:12:06.868 align:start position:0%
assuming that the providers get um their
charges

07:12:06.868 --> 07:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
charges
 
07:12:09.750 --> 07:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
um uh and one of the other um handouts
 
07:12:13.270 --> 07:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
that I gave to you is um the median
 
07:12:15.230 --> 07:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
build amounts or charges by the ground
 
07:12:17.150 --> 07:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers as a percentage of
 
07:12:21.070 --> 07:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
Medicare rates um actual versus proposed
 
07:12:23.468 --> 07:12:23.478 align:start position:0%
under SP 407 so this information came
 
07:12:26.468 --> 07:12:26.478 align:start position:0%
out of the Department's um uh report
 
07:12:29.230 --> 07:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
their ambulance summer Summit report um
 
07:12:30.548 --> 07:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of this handout is
 
07:12:33.190 --> 07:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
simply to show you that one provider's
 
07:12:35.350 --> 07:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
um current bill charges as a percentage
 
07:12:37.788 --> 07:12:37.798 align:start position:0%
of Medicare
 
07:12:41.468 --> 07:12:41.478 align:start position:0%
um uh you will see that in six of the
 
07:12:44.388 --> 07:12:44.398 align:start position:0%
nine billing code categories um their
 
07:12:47.910 --> 07:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
Bild charges are actually below 32%
 
07:12:49.990 --> 07:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
which means that in six of those nine
 
07:12:52.788 --> 07:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
categories it would go up
 
07:12:55.150 --> 07:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
um and the final point I would just say
 
07:12:57.910 --> 07:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
is um you know during the period between
 
07:13:00.430 --> 07:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
when um this bill was had come out of
 
07:13:03.030 --> 07:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate HH committee and was on its
 
07:13:05.350 --> 07:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
way to Senate Finance um as you heard
 
07:13:06.548 --> 07:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
during one of the calls that the
 
07:13:08.708 --> 07:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
carriers had with the prime sponsor of
 
07:13:10.510 --> 07:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
the bill and and one of The Advocates
 
07:13:13.350 --> 07:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
the carriers were um criticized for not
 
07:13:15.468 --> 07:13:15.478 align:start position:0%
having put forth a concrete proposal
 
07:13:18.030 --> 07:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
during the ambulance Summit meetings um
 
07:13:19.070 --> 07:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
which I think we found a little
 
07:13:20.628 --> 07:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
interesting because I'm not sure that
 
07:13:22.510 --> 07:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
they put forward a concrete proposal
 
07:13:24.788 --> 07:13:24.798 align:start position:0%
either but at any rate we took that
 
07:13:26.750 --> 07:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
comment seriously and we actually did
 
07:13:31.230 --> 07:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
submit to them um a proposal um which I
 
07:13:33.670 --> 07:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
I guess um they never responded to it so
 
07:13:35.910 --> 07:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
I guess it um wasn't one that they were
 
07:13:37.990 --> 07:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
interested in um but it would have
 
07:13:40.430 --> 07:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
required um direct pay by the health
 
07:13:42.030 --> 07:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers to the ambulance
 
07:13:44.110 --> 07:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
providers it would have Pro prohibited
 
07:13:46.670 --> 07:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
balance billing it would have required
 
07:13:49.430 --> 07:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
um carriers to directly pay 180% of
 
07:13:51.990 --> 07:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare to out of network providers
 
07:13:55.310 --> 07:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
200% of Medicare to in network providers
 
07:13:57.150 --> 07:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
um or the provider's bill charges
 
07:13:59.548 --> 07:13:59.558 align:start position:0%
whichever is less um and again this is
 
07:14:02.030 --> 07:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
for um the unscheduled or emergency
 
07:14:05.110 --> 07:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
ambulance transports um it was modeled
 
07:14:08.548 --> 07:14:08.558 align:start position:0%
after uh the law in Maine um and from
 
07:14:10.670 --> 07:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
our perspective would have represented a
 
07:14:13.788 --> 07:14:13.798 align:start position:0%
significant and E economically ad uh
 
07:14:16.468 --> 07:14:16.478 align:start position:0%
advantageous increase in payments um
 
07:14:19.230 --> 07:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
from the fully insured health plans to a
 
07:14:20.990 --> 07:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
municipal and private um ground
 
07:14:22.948 --> 07:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers especially the ones
 
07:14:25.670 --> 07:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
operating in New Hampshire's Rural and C
 
07:14:30.708 --> 07:14:30.718 align:start position:0%
rural areas um so in closing we um are
 
07:14:34.030 --> 07:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
our opposed s SP 407 and we would um
 
07:14:35.948 --> 07:14:35.958 align:start position:0%
encourage you to find it inexpedient to
 
07:14:38.190 --> 07:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'd be happy to try to
 
07:14:40.070 --> 07:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
07:14:42.070 --> 07:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
07:14:44.310 --> 07:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
spear you obviously have a lot of this
 
07:14:46.150 --> 07:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
written down is there any chance you
 
07:14:48.150 --> 07:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
could send it to us there's no way I
 
07:14:49.788 --> 07:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
could have written that fast I'll try to
 
07:14:51.388 --> 07:14:51.398 align:start position:0%
clean it up it's just my my notes but I
 
07:14:53.510 --> 07:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
would be happy to do that I appreciate
 
07:14:57.350 --> 07:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
it representative pelli so I I fully
 
07:14:59.750 --> 07:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the issue and I really want
 
07:15:03.110 --> 07:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
to thank everybody here here today we we
 
07:15:06.788 --> 07:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
want a a EMT when we need one so I
 
07:15:09.310 --> 07:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
really appreciate all of you however
 
07:15:12.388 --> 07:15:12.398 align:start position:0%
this is a really complicated issue so
 
07:15:13.788 --> 07:15:13.798 align:start position:0%
this is I'm assuming this is a
 
07:15:16.310 --> 07:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
nationwide problem are there any states
 
07:15:16.320 --> 07:15:17.310 align:start position:0%
nationwide problem are there any states
that

07:15:17.310 --> 07:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:15:21.510 --> 07:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
have um solve this issue or don't not
 
07:15:23.510 --> 07:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
have these problem these billing
 
07:15:26.708 --> 07:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
problems do you know of um I think it is
 
07:15:29.750 --> 07:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
um probably a nationwide problem and I
 
07:15:31.590 --> 07:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
think it stems prod dominantly from
 
07:15:34.270 --> 07:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare and to some extent Medicaid
 
07:15:36.388 --> 07:15:36.398 align:start position:0%
underpaying um and of course the
 
07:15:39.350 --> 07:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
uninsured um uh
 
07:15:42.350 --> 07:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
so so I do think it's probably a problem
 
07:15:46.030 --> 07:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
that we see nationally um there are a a
 
07:15:48.230 --> 07:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
handful of states that um are trying to
 
07:15:52.510 --> 07:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
tackle this um in ways like Maine or
 
07:15:54.788 --> 07:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
ways like you see in this bill um they
 
07:15:57.868 --> 07:15:57.878 align:start position:0%
are all very very new um and there's not
 
07:16:00.750 --> 07:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
the experience to see how they will work
 
07:16:03.310 --> 07:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
um if they will work um and what sort of
 
07:16:05.270 --> 07:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences there might be
 
07:16:06.910 --> 07:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
and they are all very they should at
 
07:16:09.868 --> 07:16:09.878 align:start position:0%
least be in my in our opinion um State
 
07:16:12.270 --> 07:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
specific because each state has its own
 
07:16:15.150 --> 07:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
just unique features just a quick
 
07:16:18.030 --> 07:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
clarifying question so the pie chart was
 
07:16:21.350 --> 07:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
very helpful so because Medicare and
 
07:16:25.270 --> 07:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates are so significantly low
 
07:16:28.110 --> 07:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
we're asking the fully insured Market to
 
07:16:30.948 --> 07:16:30.958 align:start position:0%
try to make up for the shortfalls of
 
07:16:33.350 --> 07:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid is that how I'm
 
07:16:35.230 --> 07:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we're concerned about yes
 
07:16:36.430 --> 07:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
07:16:39.788 --> 07:16:39.798 align:start position:0%
you representa m thank you Mr chairman
 
07:16:41.510 --> 07:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so on
 
07:16:44.468 --> 07:16:44.478 align:start position:0%
how about on the um insurance department
 
07:16:47.230 --> 07:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment have did you see it so I for
 
07:16:49.468 --> 07:16:49.478 align:start position:0%
today or I just found out about it today
 
07:16:51.548 --> 07:16:51.558 align:start position:0%
um as well and and I was given a copy
 
07:16:53.590 --> 07:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
after Alex testified but I haven't had a
 
07:16:55.510 --> 07:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
chance to take a look at it so I it
 
07:16:58.230 --> 07:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like it parallels the um
 
07:17:00.350 --> 07:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
Department's report um in their
 
07:17:00.360 --> 07:17:01.430 align:start position:0%
Department's report um in their
recommendation

07:17:01.430 --> 07:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
07:17:03.670 --> 07:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
but I would have to take a closer look
 
07:17:06.670 --> 07:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
at it B based on the experience in the
 
07:17:08.510 --> 07:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
five states that have sounds like it's
 
07:17:09.910 --> 07:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
similar to the five states that have
 
07:17:09.920 --> 07:17:10.830 align:start position:0%
similar to the five states that have
passed

07:17:10.830 --> 07:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
passed
 
07:17:14.510 --> 07:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
it do you have any comment on those
 
07:17:16.468 --> 07:17:16.478 align:start position:0%
those States or would you guys support
 
07:17:19.590 --> 07:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
it I'm really I'm I'm I'll try to get an
 
07:17:21.548 --> 07:17:21.558 align:start position:0%
answer for you but I don't have one this
 
07:17:24.628 --> 07:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon okay I think the problem right
 
07:17:28.270 --> 07:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
now is the balance billing well we heard
 
07:17:30.110 --> 07:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment prohibits that is 325 with
 
07:17:31.548 --> 07:17:31.558 align:start position:0%
no balance billing
 
07:17:32.830 --> 07:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what they I think
 
07:17:34.310 --> 07:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's what they did in the other five
 
07:17:36.230 --> 07:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
states or at least five were four were
 
07:17:38.788 --> 07:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
325 one was 400 but I'll have to check
 
07:17:40.310 --> 07:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
and see if there balance billing I I can
 
07:17:42.230 --> 07:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
I can address at least that that my from
 
07:17:44.030 --> 07:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
what I've seen um every other state
 
07:17:45.590 --> 07:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's tried to tackle this has banned
 
07:17:47.548 --> 07:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
balance billing everybody
 
07:17:52.110 --> 07:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
else doesn't no the amendment does and
 
07:17:54.270 --> 07:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
and we heard in testimony that they'd be
 
07:17:57.548 --> 07:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
okay with 325 and no balance billing who
 
07:17:59.868 --> 07:17:59.878 align:start position:0%
who was okay with that I believe Mr STW
 
07:18:03.388 --> 07:18:03.398 align:start position:0%
was said they that he he said in his
 
07:18:05.750 --> 07:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
testimony they'd be okay with Banning
 
07:18:06.948 --> 07:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
balance billing in fact he said they
 
07:18:08.750 --> 07:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
want to ban balance billing but they
 
07:18:12.150 --> 07:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
need 325 to make it a okay business
 
07:18:13.910 --> 07:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
model to do it I'm sure he did I guess
 
07:18:15.310 --> 07:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
we'll have to watch the tape on that one
 
07:18:18.310 --> 07:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure I'm sure he did okay
 
07:18:20.548 --> 07:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
represent I just have a really simple
 
07:18:23.510 --> 07:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
question um so the P the pie chart that
 
07:18:25.230 --> 07:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
you passed
 
07:18:29.990 --> 07:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
out uh three4 of the pie chart would pay
 
07:18:34.030 --> 07:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
a third less than a third of this
 
07:18:34.040 --> 07:18:35.590 align:start position:0%
a third less than a third of this
325

07:18:35.590 --> 07:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
325
 
07:18:37.868 --> 07:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
uh I'm trying to frame the question in
 
07:18:39.670 --> 07:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
the simplest way possible so if this
 
07:18:41.750 --> 07:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
goes through the private insured which
 
07:18:45.750 --> 07:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
is about 20 25% would pay three
 
07:18:48.468 --> 07:18:48.478 align:start position:0%
times three and a quarter times what
 
07:18:50.868 --> 07:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid is paying out for
 
07:18:52.468 --> 07:18:52.478 align:start position:0%
the same exact service that's a correct
 
07:18:54.110 --> 07:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
to so it would be 100% of Medicare is
 
07:18:55.990 --> 07:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
what's being paid by Medicare and with
 
07:18:59.910 --> 07:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
the budget that was passed last um June
 
07:19:01.948 --> 07:19:01.958 align:start position:0%
um Med medic my understanding is that
 
07:19:04.628 --> 07:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid rate increase um which I
 
07:19:06.590 --> 07:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
think the state put in something like
 
07:19:09.430 --> 07:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
$5.7 million I think that gets matched
 
07:19:12.548 --> 07:19:12.558 align:start position:0%
federally so you know something close to
 
07:19:14.990 --> 07:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
in the 11 to 12 million range additional
 
07:19:17.750 --> 07:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funds um which my understanding
 
07:19:20.270 --> 07:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
is that that brings Medicaid relatively
 
07:19:23.670 --> 07:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
on par with what Medicare pays um so yes
 
07:19:26.110 --> 07:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
100% of Medicare um but just one point
 
07:19:28.750 --> 07:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
of clarification on what you said um the
 
07:19:32.270 --> 07:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
only um part of that pie that this bill
 
07:19:35.948 --> 07:19:35.958 align:start position:0%
targets is the 10% the fully insured
 
07:19:39.708 --> 07:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
Market um in individual market and the
 
07:19:41.868 --> 07:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
small employer so it doesn't um you know
 
07:19:44.190 --> 07:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
there's kind of two parts to Commercial
 
07:19:46.468 --> 07:19:46.478 align:start position:0%
Insurance there's the fully insured and
 
07:19:48.670 --> 07:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
the self-funded um and of course we
 
07:19:50.830 --> 07:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
can't touch self-funded with state laws
 
07:19:53.868 --> 07:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
so um it's from the perspective of the
 
07:19:56.150 --> 07:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
bills going out from the ambulance
 
07:19:58.590 --> 07:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
providers and that that information came
 
07:20:00.750 --> 07:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
from one of the ambulance providers um
 
07:20:03.590 --> 07:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
during the ambulance Summit the data
 
07:20:05.788 --> 07:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
that's in that Pi so they said that
 
07:20:08.750 --> 07:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 15 and 20% of their
 
07:20:11.628 --> 07:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
payer mix was commercial and that
 
07:20:13.430 --> 07:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
includes both self-funded and fully
 
07:20:15.350 --> 07:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
insured and So based on what we know
 
07:20:18.310 --> 07:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
about those Dynamics in our Market it's
 
07:20:20.830 --> 07:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
under 10% for fully insured quick follow
 
07:20:22.868 --> 07:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
forther question me inquire just so I
 
07:20:24.750 --> 07:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
understand the self-funded portion which
 
07:20:27.830 --> 07:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
is 10% of this pie what rates do they
 
07:20:30.030 --> 07:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
pay and how are they determined it's a
 
07:20:31.910 --> 07:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
good question I don't have specific
 
07:20:34.190 --> 07:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
information on that but I would guess
 
07:20:37.310 --> 07:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
that it's probably relatively close to
 
07:20:41.270 --> 07:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
what the um what the fully insured um
 
07:20:43.750 --> 07:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
payers pay
 
07:20:46.590 --> 07:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
um there's just because of
 
07:20:49.430 --> 07:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
the a lot of carriers will act as a
 
07:20:52.230 --> 07:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
third-party administrator to those
 
07:20:54.150 --> 07:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
self-funded plans so even though they're
 
07:20:55.708 --> 07:20:55.718 align:start position:0%
taking the risk and they're paying the
 
07:20:58.388 --> 07:20:58.398 align:start position:0%
cost they hire a carrier to actually do
 
07:21:00.350 --> 07:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
the administrative work and so they look
 
07:21:02.150 --> 07:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
to the carriers for a lot of guidance
 
07:21:05.388 --> 07:21:05.398 align:start position:0%
around appropriate reimbursement um so
 
07:21:06.708 --> 07:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
if I had to guess I'd say they're
 
07:21:06.718 --> 07:21:09.430 align:start position:0%
if I had to guess I'd say they're
probably

07:21:09.430 --> 07:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
probably
 
07:21:11.830 --> 07:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
close right if we take any experience of
 
07:21:14.548 --> 07:21:14.558 align:start position:0%
the state is uh anything we mandate here
 
07:21:16.750 --> 07:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
the state eventually picks up so
 
07:21:19.708 --> 07:21:19.718 align:start position:0%
theoretically that that I would manage I
 
07:21:22.030 --> 07:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
believe Anthem manages the state's plan
 
07:21:24.590 --> 07:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
right that's correct right so I I I you
 
07:21:26.468 --> 07:21:26.478 align:start position:0%
know's left the room but I I think that
 
07:21:29.510 --> 07:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's probably uh the rates that that
 
07:21:33.750 --> 07:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
they use the same scenario so that's why
 
07:21:36.750 --> 07:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
they're hoping that if we pass this 325
 
07:21:39.190 --> 07:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
then all those Arisa plans and like the
 
07:21:43.788 --> 07:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
state or the county will jump in and pay
 
07:21:45.830 --> 07:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
the the extra rate but again we can't we
 
07:21:47.628 --> 07:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
can't mandate that and so I think you
 
07:21:50.548 --> 07:21:50.558 align:start position:0%
know from a from a um from the
 
07:21:52.270 --> 07:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
perspective of the business Community
 
07:21:55.750 --> 07:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
this is kind of piling on those small
 
07:21:57.270 --> 07:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
and midsize businesses that are
 
07:21:59.708 --> 07:21:59.718 align:start position:0%
purchasing fully insured products and
 
07:22:01.868 --> 07:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
creating an UNL playing field because on
 
07:22:03.868 --> 07:22:03.878 align:start position:0%
the you know the the ones that are large
 
07:22:06.190 --> 07:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
enough to sell fund wouldn't be under
 
07:22:08.350 --> 07:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
this mandate you have a question
 
07:22:09.990 --> 07:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
represent M just really really quick
 
07:22:13.708 --> 07:22:13.718 align:start position:0%
since the you expressed some reservation
 
07:22:15.628 --> 07:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
about what happened in the Senate with
 
07:22:17.270 --> 07:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment no public hearing or
 
07:22:18.788 --> 07:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
whatnot and kind of the same thing is
 
07:22:21.110 --> 07:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
going on here we got an amendment we've
 
07:22:23.788 --> 07:22:23.798 align:start position:0%
got a subcommittee tomorrow planning on
 
07:22:25.510 --> 07:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
executing it later in the day
 
07:22:29.628 --> 07:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so can we you wouldn't have the
 
07:22:31.868 --> 07:22:31.878 align:start position:0%
same reservation
 
07:22:34.948 --> 07:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
if we look at this amendment work on it
 
07:22:38.110 --> 07:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow EXA tomorrow I I would hope
 
07:22:41.270 --> 07:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
that you would retain this bill for some
 
07:22:44.830 --> 07:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
further study um that would be you know
 
07:22:46.868 --> 07:22:46.878 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm recom we're you know our
 
07:22:48.628 --> 07:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation officially is you know
 
07:22:51.110 --> 07:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
itl but if you know it clearly needs
 
07:22:53.910 --> 07:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
more work um our reservation in the
 
07:22:55.868 --> 07:22:55.878 align:start position:0%
Senate was that the amendment came in
 
07:22:59.468 --> 07:22:59.478 align:start position:0%
during the Senate HHS executive session
 
07:23:01.150 --> 07:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
um it was not an amendment that we had
 
07:23:03.830 --> 07:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
seen um and I don't I don't believe
 
07:23:06.150 --> 07:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
others had seen either it was exact that
 
07:23:08.388 --> 07:23:08.398 align:start position:0%
day um Without Really any discussion the
 
07:23:10.510 --> 07:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
focus at that executive session was on
 
07:23:12.110 --> 07:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
the direct pay piece because that was
 
07:23:14.990 --> 07:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
the underlying original bill um but this
 
07:23:16.868 --> 07:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
was obviously substantially different
 
07:23:18.308 --> 07:23:18.318 align:start position:0%
you've been here a long time amendments
 
07:23:20.350 --> 07:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
come in all the time and get exact same
 
07:23:22.708 --> 07:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
day all the time so and this is a
 
07:23:25.430 --> 07:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
problem we've dealt with a long
 
07:23:29.270 --> 07:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
time not in this committee Mr chairman
 
07:23:30.910 --> 07:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
you bringing amendments all all the time
 
07:23:33.150 --> 07:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
at the last minute and we exec them
 
07:23:36.590 --> 07:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
forth with no I don't the few amendments
 
07:23:40.590 --> 07:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
we've had were tiny that before we exact
 
07:23:43.350 --> 07:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
AR to respond to your question we we
 
07:23:45.868 --> 07:23:45.878 align:start position:0%
fully appreciate a full and open process
 
07:23:48.948 --> 07:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:52.350 --> 07:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
bodies thank you very much for your
 
07:23:56.308 --> 07:23:56.318 align:start position:0%
testimony okay that's uh Drew Klein I
 
07:24:02.990 --> 07:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:05.110 --> 07:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
going the wrong
 
07:24:07.430 --> 07:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
way Mr chairman members of the committee
 
07:24:08.628 --> 07:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the opportunity to
 
07:24:10.910 --> 07:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
testify I'm Drew Lon I'm president of
 
07:24:12.270 --> 07:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
the Josiah baret Center for Public
 
07:24:13.670 --> 07:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
Policy New Hampshire's free market Think
 
07:24:15.590 --> 07:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
Tank and although I hate to be on the
 
07:24:18.350 --> 07:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
opposite side of an issue from Chris STW
 
07:24:21.110 --> 07:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
who's a great guy um we look at this
 
07:24:22.350 --> 07:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
bill and just the way it's written I
 
07:24:23.830 --> 07:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
know it's a complicated problem and it's
 
07:24:24.868 --> 07:24:24.878 align:start position:0%
something the state's been trying to
 
07:24:26.468 --> 07:24:26.478 align:start position:0%
solve for a long time and it and it
 
07:24:29.150 --> 07:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
screams out for some type of solution
 
07:24:31.150 --> 07:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
but the way this bill is written uh as
 
07:24:33.788 --> 07:24:33.798 align:start position:0%
we look at it it it really does create
 
07:24:36.750 --> 07:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a a default floor uh for
 
07:24:40.910 --> 07:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
these prices by the way it's structured
 
07:24:45.350 --> 07:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
is says you can reimburse for um one of
 
07:24:46.868 --> 07:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
three different rates right the
 
07:24:50.308 --> 07:24:50.318 align:start position:0%
negotiated rate the build rate or 325 of
 
07:24:53.510 --> 07:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that one is set so you know
 
07:24:55.990 --> 07:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
what the 325 per of Medicaid is so what
 
07:24:57.868 --> 07:24:57.878 align:start position:0%
the effects of this will
 
07:25:01.750 --> 07:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
do just basic economic theory at work
 
07:25:03.910 --> 07:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
why would anyone negotiate any rate that
 
07:25:06.350 --> 07:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
is lower than 325 of federal poerty
 
07:25:08.590 --> 07:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
level it's a very high percentage it's
 
07:25:10.990 --> 07:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily chosen you heard from the
 
07:25:12.788 --> 07:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
insurance department it's much higher
 
07:25:15.670 --> 07:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
than what um is being paid in many cases
 
07:25:17.350 --> 07:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
we looked at the insurance Department's
 
07:25:20.110 --> 07:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
numbers with median rates for different
 
07:25:21.910 --> 07:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
services that they just published uh
 
07:25:25.190 --> 07:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
last month and um there are quite a few
 
07:25:27.830 --> 07:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
services in the rural part of the state
 
07:25:30.468 --> 07:25:30.478 align:start position:0%
that are well below 325
 
07:25:32.910 --> 07:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
of the Medicare rate so we look at this
 
07:25:35.868 --> 07:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
and go you're likely to
 
07:25:38.990 --> 07:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
increase prices uh in rural areas in New
 
07:25:40.708 --> 07:25:40.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of this the way this
 
07:25:43.750 --> 07:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill is structured so we just say this
 
07:25:45.750 --> 07:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
is probably not the best way to go about
 
07:25:48.308 --> 07:25:48.318 align:start position:0%
fixing this problem the problem in the
 
07:25:52.070 --> 07:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
ambulance price um and billing model is
 
07:25:52.948 --> 07:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
that you just you don't have a
 
07:25:55.110 --> 07:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
competitive market so there's no way for
 
07:25:57.430 --> 07:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
the consumer to know what the price is
 
07:25:58.708 --> 07:25:58.718 align:start position:0%
what they're going to get built for I
 
07:26:00.628 --> 07:26:00.638 align:start position:0%
mean that's That's the basis of problem
 
07:26:03.150 --> 07:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
then you got Medicare that you know pays
 
07:26:05.070 --> 07:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
an arbitrarily low rate so you know all
 
07:26:07.830 --> 07:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
the all that um there are ways you can
 
07:26:12.628 --> 07:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
sort of try to approximate a market um
 
07:26:15.430 --> 07:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
when you don't have one and one can't be
 
07:26:18.948 --> 07:26:18.958 align:start position:0%
created picking a number um you know
 
07:26:20.270 --> 07:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
because a few other states did it and
 
07:26:21.910 --> 07:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
just inserting into law which will
 
07:26:24.628 --> 07:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
require more legislative work to change
 
07:26:26.110 --> 07:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
if that turns out not to be the best
 
07:26:28.350 --> 07:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
number it's just really um not the most
 
07:26:29.548 --> 07:26:29.558 align:start position:0%
effective way to do it and I think it
 
07:26:31.468 --> 07:26:31.478 align:start position:0%
will end up leading to price increases
 
07:26:35.030 --> 07:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
across the board so that's
 
07:26:38.230 --> 07:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
all thank you very much chair will call
 
07:26:54.750 --> 07:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:56.868 --> 07:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
lemon thank you this is my first time
 
07:26:59.468 --> 07:26:59.478 align:start position:0%
doing this good evening so uh my name is
 
07:27:01.190 --> 07:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
Chris Lumin I'm the executive director
 
07:27:04.190 --> 07:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
for McGregor EMS we're a nonprofit uh
 
07:27:06.308 --> 07:27:06.318 align:start position:0%
ambulance service located in Durham New
 
07:27:08.868 --> 07:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we're a little bit unique
 
07:27:11.590 --> 07:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh in that we have about 30,000 hour we
 
07:27:13.270 --> 07:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
have a lot of volunteers who give about
 
07:27:15.708 --> 07:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
30,000 hours of commun of time to the
 
07:27:18.628 --> 07:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
communities every year and so I want to
 
07:27:20.110 --> 07:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
speak to a question that's been raised a
 
07:27:22.548 --> 07:27:22.558 align:start position:0%
couple of times about why would McGregor
 
07:27:25.190 --> 07:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
choose not to be in network with these
 
07:27:27.150 --> 07:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and this was
 
07:27:28.590 --> 07:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
something we worked very closely with
 
07:27:31.308 --> 07:27:31.318 align:start position:0%
the communities uh that we serve uh and
 
07:27:34.948 --> 07:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
have a a very transparent process and
 
07:27:37.308 --> 07:27:37.318 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits to being a nonprofit
 
07:27:39.910 --> 07:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh is that and you know being so
 
07:27:41.430 --> 07:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
Community Based is that because our
 
07:27:43.308 --> 07:27:43.318 align:start position:0%
budget is open one of the things I've
 
07:27:46.308 --> 07:27:46.318 align:start position:0%
said to the uh anthem when I've reached
 
07:27:48.230 --> 07:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
out to them on multiple occasions is
 
07:27:51.708 --> 07:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
listen I can't make ends meet with what
 
07:27:53.868 --> 07:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
you're offering but i' love to have a
 
07:27:55.708 --> 07:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
conversation we'll show you what our
 
07:27:57.868 --> 07:27:57.878 align:start position:0%
costs are in spite of all this volunteer
 
07:28:00.910 --> 07:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
time in spite of being a nonprofit
 
07:28:04.110 --> 07:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
um and I can you work with me and
 
07:28:06.750 --> 07:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
they've said no they cannot now I
 
07:28:08.868 --> 07:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
reached out to them when this process
 
07:28:11.468 --> 07:28:11.478 align:start position:0%
began when this legislation started to
 
07:28:13.110 --> 07:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
be talked about and of course there's
 
07:28:14.990 --> 07:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
work at the federal level as well
 
07:28:17.830 --> 07:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
thinking gez maybe we will see some
 
07:28:20.030 --> 07:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
progress on this right maybe this is the
 
07:28:23.150 --> 07:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
time when minds are being changed and
 
07:28:26.150 --> 07:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
big surprise Anam said well you know
 
07:28:27.868 --> 07:28:27.878 align:start position:0%
we've increased what we're offering
 
07:28:29.708 --> 07:28:29.718 align:start position:0%
quite a bit but we're still not willing
 
07:28:31.110 --> 07:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
to talk to you we're still not willing
 
07:28:33.990 --> 07:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
to work with you at the end of the day
 
07:28:36.830 --> 07:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
if McGregor were to go in service or uh
 
07:28:39.590 --> 07:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
in network with uh
 
07:28:42.990 --> 07:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
Anthem um it would end up being a loss
 
07:28:44.708 --> 07:28:44.718 align:start position:0%
of money for us and what that would mean
 
07:28:46.430 --> 07:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
is that then I'd be turning around and
 
07:28:48.110 --> 07:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
going back to the four communities that
 
07:28:51.030 --> 07:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
I serve uh within New Hampshire and
 
07:28:53.070 --> 07:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
asking them to pitch in more money for
 
07:28:55.510 --> 07:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
the service uh so there's been a lot of
 
07:28:57.350 --> 07:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
question about you know why are we not
 
07:28:59.628 --> 07:28:59.638 align:start position:0%
working with uh with the insurance
 
07:29:02.750 --> 07:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
company I've not been at the table that
 
07:29:04.670 --> 07:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh some of these other pieces you know
 
07:29:05.868 --> 07:29:05.878 align:start position:0%
these other groups have been talking
 
07:29:08.670 --> 07:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
about but I would say that I'm not as
 
07:29:10.150 --> 07:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
experienced as many of the people here I
 
07:29:13.788 --> 07:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
only have 22 years of doing this but uh
 
07:29:16.308 --> 07:29:16.318 align:start position:0%
you know I didn't become an EMT I didn't
 
07:29:19.190 --> 07:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
become a nurse uh so I could be messing
 
07:29:21.708 --> 07:29:21.718 align:start position:0%
over patients and because of my role I'm
 
07:29:23.270 --> 07:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
the one that takes the phone calls from
 
07:29:25.230 --> 07:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
the patients when they are stuck in the
 
07:29:27.230 --> 07:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
middle and we work with them on that but
 
07:29:30.430 --> 07:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
it is a very frustrating uh process C
 
07:29:32.270 --> 07:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
and it's a very confusing process for
 
07:29:34.868 --> 07:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
the patients because of this getting
 
07:29:36.388 --> 07:29:36.398 align:start position:0%
getting this check I would also just
 
07:29:39.190 --> 07:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
note that Anthem is the only insurance
 
07:29:41.468 --> 07:29:41.478 align:start position:0%
company that we work with regularly that
 
07:29:43.308 --> 07:29:43.318 align:start position:0%
does that that sends the check directly
 
07:29:46.510 --> 07:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
to the patient uh so the notion that you
 
07:29:48.070 --> 07:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
know they can't send us the check
 
07:29:49.430 --> 07:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
directly because we don't have a
 
07:29:51.990 --> 07:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
contractual relationship seems a little
 
07:29:54.270 --> 07:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
disingenuous to me the last thing I will
 
07:29:57.070 --> 07:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
just share is that um we are a small
 
07:29:59.510 --> 07:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
employer as well and so you know our
 
07:30:00.510 --> 07:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's all always a double-edged
 
07:30:02.190 --> 07:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
sword right because I pull my hair out
 
07:30:04.628 --> 07:30:04.638 align:start position:0%
when I see the uh insurance rates go up
 
07:30:06.308 --> 07:30:06.318 align:start position:0%
every year and then I pull my hair out
 
07:30:07.628 --> 07:30:07.638 align:start position:0%
because uh and I don't have a lot of
 
07:30:10.270 --> 07:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
hair uh when uh you know we're trying to
 
07:30:12.948 --> 07:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
make ends meet in terms of our budget uh
 
07:30:14.708 --> 07:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
but this seems like a small price to pay
 
07:30:17.548 --> 07:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
for from a small insurer perspective to
 
07:30:19.628 --> 07:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
ensure that uh if I have a medical
 
07:30:25.670 --> 07:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:28.910 --> 07:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
up representative spear has a question
 
07:30:31.670 --> 07:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
so if the rate was
 
07:30:36.750 --> 07:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
325 of Medicare but you couldn't balance
 
07:30:40.468 --> 07:30:40.478 align:start position:0%
Bill how does that said with you so I
 
07:30:41.868 --> 07:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
can only speak for my for my
 
07:30:44.868 --> 07:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
organization myself that would uh put us
 
07:30:47.750 --> 07:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
in a we could that would be
 
07:30:49.910 --> 07:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
fine thank you we could make ends meet
 
07:30:51.990 --> 07:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
we could not make ends meet and I would
 
07:30:54.468 --> 07:30:54.478 align:start position:0%
have to go back and do the do the math
 
07:30:57.270 --> 07:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
but I have a general sense of the rates
 
07:30:59.590 --> 07:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be very shocked uh and I haven't
 
07:31:01.830 --> 07:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
done the mass specifically but it what
 
07:31:03.868 --> 07:31:03.878 align:start position:0%
was proposed earlier today is not
 
07:31:07.548 --> 07:31:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:12.270 --> 07:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:23.230 --> 07:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:25.468 --> 07:31:25.478 align:start position:0%
Boran thank you Mr chairman it's good to
 
07:31:26.388 --> 07:31:26.398 align:start position:0%
see you
 
07:31:28.990 --> 07:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
again ladies and gentlemen I'm going to
 
07:31:30.830 --> 07:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
apologize to you in Advance according to
 
07:31:32.708 --> 07:31:32.718 align:start position:0%
my children when I'm passionate on an
 
07:31:35.468 --> 07:31:35.478 align:start position:0%
issue I get unintentional angry voice so
 
07:31:37.388 --> 07:31:37.398 align:start position:0%
if I seem like I'm fired up I apologize
 
07:31:41.110 --> 07:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
in advance uh I had a very well worded
 
07:31:42.628 --> 07:31:42.638 align:start position:0%
speech all prepared for you and there's
 
07:31:44.350 --> 07:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
been enough testimony now that that's
 
07:31:46.270 --> 07:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
out the window completely so you'll have
 
07:31:48.788 --> 07:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
to bear with me a little bit uh doubling
 
07:31:50.628 --> 07:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
down on what Chris just said the in
 
07:31:52.670 --> 07:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
network issue that you guys are focusing
 
07:31:55.708 --> 07:31:55.718 align:start position:0%
on there is no benefit to me at all in
 
07:31:58.548 --> 07:31:58.558 align:start position:0%
our organization uh at 45th parallel EMS
 
07:32:00.388 --> 07:32:00.398 align:start position:0%
there's no benefit whatsoever to being
 
07:32:02.628 --> 07:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
in their Network at this current time
 
07:32:07.030 --> 07:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
they offer us minuscule 160% of Medicare
 
07:32:09.750 --> 07:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
and that does not come anywhere near
 
07:32:12.070 --> 07:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
covering our cost of operation up north
 
07:32:16.150 --> 07:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
not at all we represent the hardest
 
07:32:19.350 --> 07:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
demographic to cover in basically in the
 
07:32:21.708 --> 07:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
entire country we have a huge coverage
 
07:32:25.788 --> 07:32:25.798 align:start position:0%
area we cover 57 miles the last 57 miles
 
07:32:28.708 --> 07:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
of Route three from one station with two
 
07:32:31.030 --> 07:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
trucks we C cover a land mass the size
 
07:32:33.030 --> 07:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the State of Rhode Island and we have
 
07:32:35.350 --> 07:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
a population base of about 8,000 people
 
07:32:38.510 --> 07:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
to draw from most of our calls are
 
07:32:40.308 --> 07:32:40.318 align:start position:0%
transient people coming into the area to
 
07:32:43.070 --> 07:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
snowmobile four-wheel hunt those kinds
 
07:32:46.350 --> 07:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
of things so I don't have a huge tax
 
07:32:49.548 --> 07:32:49.558 align:start position:0%
base to draw from and last year I asked
 
07:32:52.110 --> 07:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
my 8,000 taxpayers in the poorest
 
07:32:54.868 --> 07:32:54.878 align:start position:0%
demographic in this state to fund us 3/4
 
07:32:57.990 --> 07:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
of a million dollars to operate our
 
07:33:01.590 --> 07:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
business 911 calls we do last year we
 
07:33:06.430 --> 07:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
did 871 911 calls about 30% of those
 
07:33:08.628 --> 07:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
were non- transports that we cannot bill
 
07:33:11.070 --> 07:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
for under current statute so we build
 
07:33:15.030 --> 07:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
for somewhere over 500 911 calls total
 
07:33:16.990 --> 07:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
to fund our entire
 
07:33:20.388 --> 07:33:20.398 align:start position:0%
operation uh of that our reimbursement
 
07:33:22.388 --> 07:33:22.398 align:start position:0%
was about
 
07:33:25.468 --> 07:33:25.478 align:start position:0%
$327,000 if I remember correctly that
 
07:33:27.868 --> 07:33:27.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't even pay for one truck much less
 
07:33:30.308 --> 07:33:30.318 align:start position:0%
the two that we staff that doesn't even
 
07:33:32.230 --> 07:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
come close when you consider that the
 
07:33:35.030 --> 07:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
cost of a current ambulance is
 
07:33:37.510 --> 07:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
$240,000 the cardiac monitor sitting in
 
07:33:39.030 --> 07:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
that ambulance is
 
07:33:42.628 --> 07:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
$50,000 all fully wrapped an ALS
 
07:33:45.510 --> 07:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance is4 to $500,000 by the time
 
07:33:46.868 --> 07:33:46.878 align:start position:0%
you get all of the equipment and
 
07:33:48.670 --> 07:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
everything in it just to start it and
 
07:33:50.948 --> 07:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
get it on the road and then there's the
 
07:33:54.110 --> 07:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
payroll issue you know the question was
 
07:33:56.510 --> 07:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
asked what the average EMT or or
 
07:33:59.230 --> 07:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
paramedic earns we can't compete with
 
07:34:00.910 --> 07:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
some of the r r that they're paying down
 
07:34:03.270 --> 07:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
here uh we're closer than I thought I
 
07:34:04.948 --> 07:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
was very impressed with our numbers when
 
07:34:07.948 --> 07:34:07.958 align:start position:0%
I heard Chris talking but we're not
 
07:34:10.308 --> 07:34:10.318 align:start position:0%
there you know we're we're paying 16 to
 
07:34:12.750 --> 07:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
35 an hour depending on certification
 
07:34:12.760 --> 07:34:13.708 align:start position:0%
35 an hour depending on certification
and

07:34:13.708 --> 07:34:13.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:34:15.868 --> 07:34:15.878 align:start position:0%
qualifications and some of us myself
 
07:34:18.150 --> 07:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
included are putting in literally a 100
 
07:34:19.868 --> 07:34:19.878 align:start position:0%
hours a week to make things work because
 
07:34:22.388 --> 07:34:22.398 align:start position:0%
we're so short staffed uh and during the
 
07:34:24.150 --> 07:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
eclipse as a matter of fact I personally
 
07:34:27.750 --> 07:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
put in 128 Hours that week There's 168
 
07:34:29.070 --> 07:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
hours in the week you're starting to see
 
07:34:30.670 --> 07:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
the picture what my life looks like
 
07:34:30.680 --> 07:34:31.388 align:start position:0%
the picture what my life looks like
right

07:34:31.388 --> 07:34:31.398 align:start position:0%
right
 
07:34:36.868 --> 07:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
now so the concept of you know 160% of
 
07:34:39.990 --> 07:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare or 180% of Medicare or 200% of
 
07:34:42.910 --> 07:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare just does not pay my operating
 
07:34:45.308 --> 07:34:45.318 align:start position:0%
costs I don't expect the insurance
 
07:34:47.910 --> 07:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
companies to pick up all of the costs I
 
07:34:50.868 --> 07:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
do not but you're addressing some of the
 
07:34:52.788 --> 07:34:52.798 align:start position:0%
others you've addressed the Medicaid
 
07:34:55.350 --> 07:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement already thank you for that
 
07:34:58.388 --> 07:34:58.398 align:start position:0%
that is a help CMS is addressing the
 
07:35:00.350 --> 07:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
Medicare issue the it's they're taking
 
07:35:01.590 --> 07:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
their time because it's the federal
 
07:35:03.548 --> 07:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
government but they're working on it so
 
07:35:06.150 --> 07:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
we have to address this piece as well no
 
07:35:07.548 --> 07:35:07.558 align:start position:0%
we're not looking for the insurance
 
07:35:09.830 --> 07:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
companies to fund absolutely everything
 
07:35:11.670 --> 07:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
but they have to do their part and they
 
07:35:15.030 --> 07:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
have not for a very long time they have
 
07:35:17.708 --> 07:35:17.718 align:start position:0%
been running all of our bills through
 
07:35:19.590 --> 07:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
this algorithm that they have that we
 
07:35:22.430 --> 07:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
can't even get a look at and repricing
 
07:35:24.830 --> 07:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
saying well we believe that it costs
 
07:35:27.270 --> 07:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
this amount of dollars to cover
 
07:35:28.868 --> 07:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
ambulance services in the state of New
 
07:35:32.230 --> 07:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and my you know 500 calls that
 
07:35:34.708 --> 07:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
I've build out really does not offset
 
07:35:36.350 --> 07:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
the call volume in the southern half of
 
07:35:38.070 --> 07:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
the state so my numbers aren't even
 
07:35:40.510 --> 07:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
factored into this so they tell me your
 
07:35:43.030 --> 07:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill for $1,500 should actually be you
 
07:35:45.590 --> 07:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
know $800 and that's what we're paying
 
07:35:48.350 --> 07:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
you and you have no recourse to uh try
 
07:35:51.628 --> 07:35:51.638 align:start position:0%
to argue this at all none anytime you
 
07:35:53.910 --> 07:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
call you get put on hold for 45 minutes
 
07:35:55.230 --> 07:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
you get kicked around to three different
 
07:35:56.590 --> 07:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
people and then the last person that
 
07:35:57.990 --> 07:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
picks up the phone disconnects
 
07:36:00.350 --> 07:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
accidentally and you start over
 
07:36:02.308 --> 07:36:02.318 align:start position:0%
so what am I supposed to
 
07:36:05.628 --> 07:36:05.638 align:start position:0%
do how how am I supposed to fix this I'm
 
07:36:08.070 --> 07:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
already going after my taxpayers for
 
07:36:10.788 --> 07:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
$750,000 a year we have added that
 
07:36:12.548 --> 07:36:12.558 align:start position:0%
second truck to be able to take as many
 
07:36:14.750 --> 07:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
interfacility transports out of
 
07:36:16.708 --> 07:36:16.718 align:start position:0%
everywhere that we possibly can to add
 
07:36:18.830 --> 07:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue to not have to go
 
07:36:22.510 --> 07:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
after our taxpayers we come as far south
 
07:36:25.388 --> 07:36:25.398 align:start position:0%
as spear in Plymouth and Memorial over
 
07:36:27.430 --> 07:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
in North Conway so our trucks are on the
 
07:36:29.350 --> 07:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
road for 2 hours before they even get to
 
07:36:32.270 --> 07:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
a patient just to grab extra Revenue
 
07:36:35.270 --> 07:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
where we can to fund our operation I
 
07:36:38.030 --> 07:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
can't push that any further I can't say
 
07:36:39.868 --> 07:36:39.878 align:start position:0%
Hey you know go down to Mass General and
 
07:36:41.270 --> 07:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
pick up a patient and be on the road for
 
07:36:43.430 --> 07:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
the next 14 hours because that doesn't
 
07:36:45.990 --> 07:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
make Financial sense either so I'm
 
07:36:48.430 --> 07:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
really stuck in a position where if we
 
07:36:51.270 --> 07:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't do something and do something soon
 
07:36:52.948 --> 07:36:52.958 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be forced to do one of two
 
07:36:55.030 --> 07:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
things I'm going to be forced to either
 
07:36:58.670 --> 07:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
cut services that we provide or go after
 
07:37:00.590 --> 07:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers for for more money and
 
07:37:02.750 --> 07:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
again this is the most rural section of
 
07:37:04.910 --> 07:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
this state and the most impoverished
 
07:37:07.070 --> 07:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
area so I don't feel right going to them
 
07:37:09.150 --> 07:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
and asking hey you know I know you're
 
07:37:11.910 --> 07:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
barely getting by on $20,000 a year but
 
07:37:13.150 --> 07:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to pay me an extra
 
07:37:15.070 --> 07:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
500 bucks this next year just to provide
 
07:37:17.548 --> 07:37:17.558 align:start position:0%
services to you that you may or may not
 
07:37:20.468 --> 07:37:20.478 align:start position:0%
need I can't increase our call volume it
 
07:37:21.990 --> 07:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
is what it is unless we can start
 
07:37:23.388 --> 07:37:23.398 align:start position:0%
figuring out how people can schedule
 
07:37:25.548 --> 07:37:25.558 align:start position:0%
their emergencies better uh in which
 
07:37:27.990 --> 07:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
case that fixes my Staffing problem too
 
07:37:30.270 --> 07:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
little humor there by the way
 
07:37:32.548 --> 07:37:32.558 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of stuck this is what I have
 
07:37:35.830 --> 07:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
to work with so we really desperately
 
07:37:38.510 --> 07:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
need your help in fixing all avenues of
 
07:37:41.308 --> 07:37:41.318 align:start position:0%
this and getting you know the funding
 
07:37:43.830 --> 07:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
that we need to stay operational if any
 
07:37:46.308 --> 07:37:46.318 align:start position:0%
of you come up into my coverage area and
 
07:37:48.430 --> 07:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
you know have a four-wheeler accident or
 
07:37:49.788 --> 07:37:49.798 align:start position:0%
have a heart attack or anything like
 
07:37:51.350 --> 07:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
that I want to be there to be able to
 
07:37:53.628 --> 07:37:53.638 align:start position:0%
help you make sure you get to where you
 
07:37:56.430 --> 07:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
need to be and you're also not burdened
 
07:37:59.070 --> 07:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
with a huge bill because you're insured
 
07:38:01.708 --> 07:38:01.718 align:start position:0%
so I actually found myself agreeing in
 
07:38:03.788 --> 07:38:03.798 align:start position:0%
part which surprised me with some of the
 
07:38:06.070 --> 07:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
insurance lobbyists that are here that I
 
07:38:08.308 --> 07:38:08.318 align:start position:0%
don't like balance billing either I
 
07:38:10.350 --> 07:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
don't like making that phone call that
 
07:38:11.868 --> 07:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
hey you know you've got a bill here to
 
07:38:14.190 --> 07:38:14.200 align:start position:0%
pay and the insurance company has told
 
07:38:15.830 --> 07:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
them no we've paid this and you're not
 
07:38:17.990 --> 07:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for that extra amount and
 
07:38:19.548 --> 07:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
we're saying yes they are so the
 
07:38:21.708 --> 07:38:21.718 align:start position:0%
patients are getting confused and we
 
07:38:23.110 --> 07:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
have to go after people that I don't
 
07:38:25.308 --> 07:38:25.318 align:start position:0%
want to have to go after because they're
 
07:38:28.110 --> 07:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
not being reimbursed properly so I
 
07:38:30.910 --> 07:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
believe it was your question about 325
 
07:38:33.308 --> 07:38:33.318 align:start position:0%
of Medicare and balance billing again
 
07:38:35.628 --> 07:38:35.638 align:start position:0%
speaking only for my organization having
 
07:38:37.070 --> 07:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
just looked at the numbers if they're
 
07:38:39.230 --> 07:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
paying 325 I'm not balance Billing at
 
07:38:41.830 --> 07:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
all I don't have to that ends that
 
07:38:44.670 --> 07:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
problem at least for our
 
07:38:44.680 --> 07:38:46.948 align:start position:0%
problem at least for our
patients

07:38:46.948 --> 07:38:46.958 align:start position:0%
patients
 
07:38:49.308 --> 07:38:49.318 align:start position:0%
um let's see what else do I have for
 
07:38:53.030 --> 07:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
notes I think that's pretty well um
 
07:38:54.430 --> 07:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
everything that I had running through my
 
07:38:55.910 --> 07:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
head at this point I'll certainly take
 
07:38:57.350 --> 07:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
any questions that you have and do my
 
07:39:01.948 --> 07:39:01.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:04.308 --> 07:39:04.318 align:start position:0%
yeah represent thank you Mr chair thank
 
07:39:07.830 --> 07:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking our questions um this was
 
07:39:12.070 --> 07:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh passed out by uh ahip I believe um it
 
07:39:15.350 --> 07:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
says that the super rural rate uh is
 
07:39:18.590 --> 07:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 160 and 200% of
 
07:39:22.230 --> 07:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid already is that uh a rate set
 
07:39:25.590 --> 07:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
by you or is it the rate that's cently
 
07:39:29.430 --> 07:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
set by CMS the the super rural uh it's
 
07:39:31.110 --> 07:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
something that they vote on and they've
 
07:39:33.910 --> 07:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
added in uh for several years uh it
 
07:39:36.070 --> 07:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
comes up for revote every few years as
 
07:39:37.230 --> 07:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
to whether they're going to continue to
 
07:39:40.030 --> 07:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
reauthorize this or Not So currently
 
07:39:43.190 --> 07:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
you're getting 160 to 200% of Medicare I
 
07:39:46.510 --> 07:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
believe it's closer to the 160 yes and
 
07:39:48.150 --> 07:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh and then your balance billing on top
 
07:39:51.030 --> 07:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
of it if necessary we can't balance Bill
 
07:39:52.830 --> 07:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh Medicare or Medicaid we can only
 
07:39:54.750 --> 07:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
balance Bill insurance companies
 
07:39:56.308 --> 07:39:56.318 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicaid we take what they
 
07:39:58.510 --> 07:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
give us um Medicare sometimes they have
 
07:40:02.110 --> 07:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
a $250 co-pay but for the most part CMS
 
07:40:05.070 --> 07:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
regulated um insurances we take what
 
07:40:08.110 --> 07:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
they they pay and that's it okay thank
 
07:40:09.628 --> 07:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
you so the balance billing issue is
 
07:40:13.510 --> 07:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
really only a commercial insurance issue
 
07:40:17.308 --> 07:40:17.318 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you very much thank
 
07:40:17.318 --> 07:40:20.510 align:start position:0%

there's a lot of good testimony today
 
07:40:54.548 --> 07:40:54.558 align:start position:0%
you know based on what has been said um
 
07:40:56.270 --> 07:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
from you know whether Senator Apprentice
 
07:40:59.670 --> 07:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
Chris St was um Chris lemlin Etc even in
 
07:41:01.150 --> 07:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
some cases you know there was some
 
07:41:03.590 --> 07:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
surprising um testimony come from from
 
07:41:05.628 --> 07:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry I just really
 
07:41:08.788 --> 07:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
want to reemphasize the uh you know how
 
07:41:11.230 --> 07:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
unique the provision of EMS is and why
 
07:41:13.190 --> 07:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
we have the problem that we have today
 
07:41:14.948 --> 07:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
you know because you can't compare EMS
 
07:41:17.150 --> 07:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
and Manchester to just as the example
 
07:41:18.990 --> 07:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
that you got from Nate all the way up
 
07:41:20.990 --> 07:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
there in colbrook you can't you know
 
07:41:22.910 --> 07:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
explain the difference just from call to
 
07:41:24.990 --> 07:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
call you know there was an example given
 
07:41:26.548 --> 07:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
earlier about the person that has to be
 
07:41:28.430 --> 07:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
carried down three flights of stairs you
 
07:41:30.670 --> 07:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
know and they weigh 300 00 lb to the
 
07:41:31.990 --> 07:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
person that very quickly can be
 
07:41:34.548 --> 07:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
extricated off a um you know the side of
 
07:41:36.670 --> 07:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
the road you know it is a very complex
 
07:41:38.190 --> 07:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
industry and you know we don't get to
 
07:41:39.708 --> 07:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
choose our patients we don't get to
 
07:41:41.788 --> 07:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
choose our payers we don't get to choose
 
07:41:43.910 --> 07:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
how we're paid or when we're paid um
 
07:41:45.910 --> 07:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
these are all problems that plag us and
 
07:41:48.070 --> 07:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
certainly um I'm not going to go over
 
07:41:50.190 --> 07:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
the in the network issue again you know
 
07:41:52.150 --> 07:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
it is you know my own experience and the
 
07:41:53.548 --> 07:41:53.558 align:start position:0%
experiences that the association has
 
07:41:54.670 --> 07:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
heard from his members that they've
 
07:41:56.750 --> 07:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
tried to go in network and they've just
 
07:41:58.670 --> 07:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
been offered a rate that is take it or
 
07:41:59.670 --> 07:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
leave it
 
07:42:02.110 --> 07:42:02.120 align:start position:0%
um and just to go over a couple things
 
07:42:05.030 --> 07:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
that were not touched on um you know our
 
07:42:07.070 --> 07:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
industry is heavily regulated and I
 
07:42:08.110 --> 07:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
think that that's one of those things
 
07:42:09.990 --> 07:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
that you know has only been touched on
 
07:42:11.990 --> 07:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
briefly on the surface you know whether
 
07:42:15.468 --> 07:42:15.478 align:start position:0%
it's the um Bureau of EMS right here in
 
07:42:17.670 --> 07:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
town um that you know providing
 
07:42:19.830 --> 07:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
regulations or local medical control
 
07:42:21.030 --> 07:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
that are saying you know these are the
 
07:42:22.990 --> 07:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
things that you must provide and some of
 
07:42:25.230 --> 07:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
the um examples that were given were
 
07:42:27.430 --> 07:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
ambulances that you know we you just
 
07:42:29.230 --> 07:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
can't throw a rusty truck on the road
 
07:42:30.628 --> 07:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
you know you have to buy a truck and you
 
07:42:32.670 --> 07:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
know they've gone up exponentially I
 
07:42:34.628 --> 07:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
personally my service you know ourland
 
07:42:36.070 --> 07:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
truck that were taking delivery that we
 
07:42:38.868 --> 07:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
waited now three years for next week is
 
07:42:41.388 --> 07:42:41.398 align:start position:0%
showing up 4400 and something thousand
 
07:42:43.868 --> 07:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
and that is before you put in a cardiac
 
07:42:46.190 --> 07:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
monitor that is before you put in all
 
07:42:47.910 --> 07:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
the other equipment that is frankly
 
07:42:51.070 --> 07:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
expected when the um ambulance is called
 
07:42:53.788 --> 07:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
you know the person dials 911 and I love
 
07:42:55.308 --> 07:42:55.318 align:start position:0%
the 911 program that we have here in
 
07:42:57.030 --> 07:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
their state they are expecting that
 
07:42:58.990 --> 07:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
person to show up and that crew to show
 
07:43:00.468 --> 07:43:00.478 align:start position:0%
up up and have the best equipment have
 
07:43:02.948 --> 07:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
the best training and be available 24
 
07:43:05.270 --> 07:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
hours a day be available whether it's at
 
07:43:07.150 --> 07:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
2:00 in the afternoon when everybody's
 
07:43:09.590 --> 07:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
around or 2 o'clock in the morning when
 
07:43:11.110 --> 07:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know there's people have just been
 
07:43:12.788 --> 07:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
waiting and you've heard about the cost
 
07:43:14.190 --> 07:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
of Readiness I'm not going to waste your
 
07:43:16.590 --> 07:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
time and go over that again but it is
 
07:43:20.150 --> 07:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
expensive um just to touch on some uh
 
07:43:21.788 --> 07:43:21.798 align:start position:0%
really quick other things you know the
 
07:43:23.510 --> 07:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
opinion of the association is that the
 
07:43:25.270 --> 07:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
insurance company should not be in the
 
07:43:26.548 --> 07:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
business of dictating how much an
 
07:43:27.910 --> 07:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
ambulance service trip should cost in
 
07:43:29.708 --> 07:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that should a local
 
07:43:31.788 --> 07:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
control and that's what we're asking for
 
07:43:34.230 --> 07:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the local decision by local
 
07:43:35.910 --> 07:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
officials the insurance industry
 
07:43:37.910 --> 07:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
strategy will limit access and take away
 
07:43:39.548 --> 07:43:39.558 align:start position:0%
local control and it will
 
07:43:41.190 --> 07:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impact rural
 
07:43:43.830 --> 07:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
communities as my friend Nate just
 
07:43:46.070 --> 07:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned um finally just to go over a
 
07:43:47.510 --> 07:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
couple things and to clear things up you
 
07:43:49.070 --> 07:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
know Medicare people are talking about
 
07:43:50.910 --> 07:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
the basic rates of Medicare you know
 
07:43:52.788 --> 07:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
Medicare 20 years ago and you can go to
 
07:43:54.468 --> 07:43:54.478 align:start position:0%
your own research and look at the May
 
07:43:57.308 --> 07:43:57.318 align:start position:0%
report from 2007 Medicare was upwards of
 
07:44:00.628 --> 07:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
14% below the cost of ambulance doing
 
07:44:02.590 --> 07:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
business and I can assure you Medicare
 
07:44:05.150 --> 07:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
has not kept up you know so those costs
 
07:44:07.230 --> 07:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
are not reflective of Medicare we're
 
07:44:09.030 --> 07:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
even now Medicaid and we do appreciate
 
07:44:11.468 --> 07:44:11.478 align:start position:0%
the relief that we received but we are
 
07:44:13.628 --> 07:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
not you know being compensated in order
 
07:44:15.308 --> 07:44:15.318 align:start position:0%
to provide that service that frankly the
 
07:44:18.110 --> 07:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
citizens demand you know they want that
 
07:44:20.868 --> 07:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
ambulance to be there 24 hours a day
 
07:44:23.430 --> 07:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
whether they know it or not and and they
 
07:44:25.708 --> 07:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
frankly expect it having taken those 911
 
07:44:29.910 --> 07:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
calls myself um just so some uh you know
 
07:44:31.468 --> 07:44:31.478 align:start position:0%
we have services that are going out of
 
07:44:33.990 --> 07:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
business because of these you know there
 
07:44:35.468 --> 07:44:35.478 align:start position:0%
are you know you just need to look at
 
07:44:37.670 --> 07:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
the paper and look in Keen you know a
 
07:44:39.308 --> 07:44:39.318 align:start position:0%
service going out of business there you
 
07:44:41.070 --> 07:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
look in Guilford there service going out
 
07:44:43.150 --> 07:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
of business there and it is directly as
 
07:44:45.190 --> 07:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
the result of their reimbursements
 
07:44:47.270 --> 07:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're not able to keep up with costs
 
07:44:49.388 --> 07:44:49.398 align:start position:0%
you know primarily because of super Roll
 
07:44:52.030 --> 07:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
and Roll problems but yes because of the
 
07:44:54.548 --> 07:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
costs um and somebody had talked about
 
07:44:55.948 --> 07:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
you know I believe it was one of the um
 
07:44:57.190 --> 07:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
representatives from the insurance
 
07:44:59.350 --> 07:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
agencies talking about how Main the
 
07:45:01.948 --> 07:45:01.958 align:start position:0%
problem or what exact language was Maine
 
07:45:03.670 --> 07:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
ended up having despite what their
 
07:45:06.510 --> 07:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
legislation having to infuse money into
 
07:45:08.990 --> 07:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
the local EMS Services because their
 
07:45:11.110 --> 07:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
regulations did not cover it they ended
 
07:45:15.990 --> 07:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:18.070 --> 07:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
effectively I think that's really all I
 
07:45:20.190 --> 07:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
have other than to say
 
07:45:22.468 --> 07:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
um is there any questions that I can
 
07:45:25.670 --> 07:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:29.070 --> 07:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
group yes R thank you for taking my
 
07:45:31.510 --> 07:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
question I live in Manchester and uh so
 
07:45:33.750 --> 07:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
I know when I call 911 I mean the
 
07:45:35.510 --> 07:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance is going to be there like
 
07:45:38.190 --> 07:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
immediately if I don't live in manchest
 
07:45:41.548 --> 07:45:41.558 align:start position:0%
I live you know in a rural Town who gets
 
07:45:43.868 --> 07:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
the call are you talking about the
 
07:45:47.350 --> 07:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
original call the 911 call yeah so man'
 
07:45:49.788 --> 07:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
I guess it's dispatched okay you
 
07:45:52.948 --> 07:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
actually have a very robust and um great
 
07:45:54.190 --> 07:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
system here that's actually pretty
 
07:45:55.628 --> 07:45:55.638 align:start position:0%
unique I worked for it the state of New
 
07:45:58.150 --> 07:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 911 program yep and when you
 
07:46:00.270 --> 07:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
dial 911 regardless of where you are in
 
07:46:02.030 --> 07:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
the state it rings and conquered they
 
07:46:04.190 --> 07:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
have a secondary peap in lonia but it
 
07:46:06.190 --> 07:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
rings and conquered and then no matter
 
07:46:09.388 --> 07:46:09.398 align:start position:0%
what time of day you get your care it
 
07:46:11.350 --> 07:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
starts when that phone rings yep I'm a
 
07:46:12.948 --> 07:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
strong proponent of that you get your
 
07:46:14.990 --> 07:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
care immediately somebody's giving CPR
 
07:46:16.830 --> 07:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
instructions somebody's telling somebody
 
07:46:18.548 --> 07:46:18.558 align:start position:0%
how to give Naran somebody is telling
 
07:46:19.868 --> 07:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
somebody how to you know alleviate
 
07:46:22.030 --> 07:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
choking within seconds of that phone
 
07:46:24.110 --> 07:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
ringing within that emergency but there
 
07:46:26.910 --> 07:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
is still that delay of you know that
 
07:46:30.030 --> 07:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance responding so that and that
 
07:46:31.388 --> 07:46:31.398 align:start position:0%
that call will then get transferred I'll
 
07:46:33.628 --> 07:46:33.638 align:start position:0%
my New London is the area that I cover
 
07:46:35.830 --> 07:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
New London dispatch dispatches for that
 
07:46:37.388 --> 07:46:37.398 align:start position:0%
area so they will have that call come in
 
07:46:39.548 --> 07:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
to them Manchester we go to Manchester
 
07:46:43.230 --> 07:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
fire Etc right thanks a lot of course
 
07:46:46.350 --> 07:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
ma'am very much thank you sir very much
 
07:46:55.110 --> 07:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:57.468 --> 07:46:57.478 align:start position:0%
say Thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
07:46:59.670 --> 07:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee recognizing the hour uh just
 
07:47:01.628 --> 07:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
uh brief points uh just highlighting
 
07:47:03.190 --> 07:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
some of the the prior concerns uh Peter
 
07:47:04.430 --> 07:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
Brar representing Harvard Pilgrim
 
07:47:06.190 --> 07:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
Healthcare the state's not for-profit
 
07:47:07.788 --> 07:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier for the individual and
 
07:47:09.590 --> 07:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
small group Market we certainly
 
07:47:10.990 --> 07:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
understand the importance of emergency
 
07:47:13.270 --> 07:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance transport and understand that
 
07:47:14.948 --> 07:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
with an individual experiences an
 
07:47:16.830 --> 07:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
emergency they really can't choose uh
 
07:47:19.388 --> 07:47:19.398 align:start position:0%
which Ambulance Service uh responds uh
 
07:47:21.110 --> 07:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
that being said we do have some concerns
 
07:47:22.510 --> 07:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
with the bill some of which you've kind
 
07:47:24.230 --> 07:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
of heard before already so I'll go
 
07:47:26.030 --> 07:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
quickly uh certainly there's a cost
 
07:47:27.750 --> 07:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
increase to this and as we've discussed
 
07:47:30.270 --> 07:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
before uh you know that cost it doesn't
 
07:47:33.030 --> 07:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
get eaten by some magic elf it's passed
 
07:47:34.708 --> 07:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
on to somebody else basically people
 
07:47:36.430 --> 07:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
paying the insurance premiums whether
 
07:47:37.948 --> 07:47:37.958 align:start position:0%
it's the individuals or if they're
 
07:47:39.468 --> 07:47:39.478 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to work for a company
 
07:47:41.150 --> 07:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
that pays for their insurance it gets
 
07:47:44.150 --> 07:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
passed on to the the uh their employer
 
07:47:46.190 --> 07:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh this is rate setting using an
 
07:47:47.510 --> 07:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
arbitrary number it's the government
 
07:47:48.868 --> 07:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
setting a number just they picked out of
 
07:47:52.948 --> 07:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
the Hat um and uh setting the rate with
 
07:47:54.150 --> 07:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
without getting rid of the balanced
 
07:47:56.350 --> 07:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
billing uh it only affects the fully
 
07:47:58.468 --> 07:47:58.478 align:start position:0%
insured Market what you saw is 10% of
 
07:48:00.830 --> 07:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
these types of calls you're basically uh
 
07:48:02.150 --> 07:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
this affects the people who are already
 
07:48:03.948 --> 07:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
paying the most when the real problem is
 
07:48:05.670 --> 07:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
the Medicare rates themselves are too
 
07:48:08.110 --> 07:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
low uh and then finally there's nothing
 
07:48:10.070 --> 07:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
really to incentivize providers to join
 
07:48:12.030 --> 07:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
a network uh in fact it's an incentive
 
07:48:13.548 --> 07:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
to other provider groups to say hey wait
 
07:48:14.948 --> 07:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
a minute if we refuse to join the
 
07:48:16.388 --> 07:48:16.398 align:start position:0%
network we can get the legislature to
 
07:48:18.430 --> 07:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
set a rate for us uh that is just
 
07:48:20.510 --> 07:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
arbitrary so for those reasons we think
 
07:48:21.590 --> 07:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
this is a bad idea you've heard all
 
07:48:23.110 --> 07:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
these reasons before I won't belor it
 
07:48:25.270 --> 07:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
and keep you any longer from your dinner
 
07:48:25.280 --> 07:48:27.110 align:start position:0%
and keep you any longer from your dinner
thank

07:48:27.110 --> 07:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:48:30.548 --> 07:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much having no more
 
07:48:35.190 --> 07:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:48.110 --> 07:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:57.708 --> 07:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
