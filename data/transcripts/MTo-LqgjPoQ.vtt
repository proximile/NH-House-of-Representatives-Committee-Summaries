prosperity not only in the Northeast but
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the nation in the current
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
economic climate marked by inflation and
 
00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
escalating costs of living the people of

New Hampshire are facing unprecedented
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
Financial pressures the policies
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
emanating from Washington DC have
 
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
contributed to a surge in the cost of
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
goods affecting the daily lives of our
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
citizens month after month Granite
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
Staters are grappling with the rising
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
costs and expenses that are stretching
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
their budgets to the breaking point in
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
these times when factors are beyond our
 
00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
control are making life harder for our
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
people it is imperative that we take
 
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
decisive action to provide relief where
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
one of the most effective ways we can do
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
this is by cutting taxes here in New
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that is precisely what the
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
consumer tax relief act aims to achieve
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have found great
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
success by lowering our taxes on
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
employers and our economy and we've seen
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
the economic boom that has come from
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
previously passed relief we've lowered
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
our business taxes here in New Hampshire
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
and we're in the final year of our
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax an income tax
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
that was placed on granite sator that is
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
finally coming to an end but we cannot
 
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
rest on our Laurels and get comfortable
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
with our tax structure as it currently
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
stands we must be even more aggressive
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
and efficient at identifying future tax
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
cuts and our options to provide relief
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
to Granite Staters the consumer tax
 
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
relief Act is a direct response to the
 
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
economic hardships faced by our citizens
 
00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:52.759 align:start position:0%
by proposing sign significant tax
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
reductions we are not only easing the
 
00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
financial burden on our residents but
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
also sending a clear message that we are
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
here to support them in tangible ways
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
lowering the business profits tax and
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax aligns with
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
our original vision of these taxes when
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
the BET was implemented fostering a more
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
business-friendly environment and
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
encouraging economic growth this growth
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
is crucial for providing job
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities and stability to our
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
citizens moreover the elimination of the
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
Communication Service tax and the
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
reduction of the meals and rooms tax
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
below Massachusetts rates are strategic
 
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
moves to enhance our state's appeal and
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
competitiveness these reductions will
 
00:16:36.749 --> 00:16:36.759 align:start position:0%
directly benefit consumers by lowering
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
the cost of essential services and
 
00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
dining out helping to mitigate the
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
impact of inflation on everyday expenses
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
and speaking for a border community in
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
our state lowering the meals and room
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
Stacks below Massachusetts will help
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
attract customers to New Hampshire for
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
not only restaurants dining out but for
 
00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
large event venues uh that are we're
 
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
losing out to other states around us
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
furthermore more by increasing the
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
distribution rate to the meals and rooms
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
Municipal Revenue fund we are ensuring
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
that the funds our municipalities are
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
expecting under the current budget and
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
rate are not affected by Future cuts to
 
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms tax rate the
 
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
consumer tax relief Act is a proactive
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
step towards alleviating the financial
 
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
strain faced by Granite Staters due to
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
external economic pressures it is a bill
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
that not only offers immediate tax
 
00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
relief but also lays the groundwork for
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
long-term economic resilience I urge my
 
00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520 align:start position:0%

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing it as a necessary measure to
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
support our citizens in these
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
challenging Economic Times and to secure
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%

taking this question with all these
 
00:17:57.799 --> 00:17:58.950 align:start position:0%
taking this question with all these
reductions

00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
reductions
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
is there a local tax increase on
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
property in each of the towns with this
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
reduction no I so I structured it
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
through OS so that as we're reducing the
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax the formula that
 
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
sends to the local Municipal fund is
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
increasing proportionally so that only
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
the state side of the revenue is
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
reductions yes uh may I have a copy of
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm do you understand what this does
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
to the state government which also is
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
suffering from the same inflation as
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
everybody else is on I'm
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
updated the BET BP cuts that you are
 
00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
making from 21 to
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
23 using uh I I believe the
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
CPI uh and I added everything together
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
and one quarter of the revenues that our
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
state collects are going to disappear by
 
00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
2027 so I a little bit later depending
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
depending on the length of time that you
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
were were moving these things out and
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
and do you realize that we have a long
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
history in this state of cutting taxes
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
at the state level uh not being able to
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
afford various Services we you used to
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
give or or subsidies we used to give to
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
the towns and the towns then having
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
to replace that by creating new less
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
efficient services at their level which
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
are go on their property taxes so I I do
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
understand the history you're referring
 
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
to representative Al me as a member of
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
the House finance committee I do
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
understand the state of revenues and
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
spending in our state um I I think I
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
will disagree with you on a on a
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental basis as to whose money this
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
is that we are cutting uh when we cut
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
taxes uh in this year um it's really the
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
projections for the reductions this year
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
are in line with what were our current
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
surpluses will probably end up in being
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
in June um so I don't think we're after
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
going to cut into Services uh certainly
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
not this year um and this really does
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
just offer a road map for not only
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
future legislators but future budget
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
writers future Governors to understand
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
what where they want to go when it comes
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
to tax relief in the Granite State uh
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
we've seen successful tax cuts in New
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire increase Revenue that the
 
00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:53.559 align:start position:0%
state's received due to the nature of
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
the tax cuts that led to economic
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
activity um and so I believe just as
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past we'll see these
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
tax cuts increase Revenue uh through
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:14.039 align:start position:0%
will any other
 
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you great thank you
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
I have to head off to house finance now
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
but thank you very much for the time
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
go good morning again thank you Mr
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Tim MCU from
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
marac Hillsboro County 12 back again to
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
talk about giving some more of the
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
people's money back to them last week we
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
spoke specifically about the meals tax
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
today's package is a little more broad
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
so for 34 years the communications tax
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
has plagued New Hampshire so much for
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
free speech in New Hampshire
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's flu season if you haven't noticed
 
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.110 align:start position:0%
it's flu season if you haven't noticed
it's

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
actually the influenza of inflation that
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
I hope this tax cut will help us
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
fix so this is the people's money and
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
they want to spend it like they spend
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
their own so we need to take action on
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
this bill on
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
1422 and pass the consumer tax relief
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
act nearly every day in some fashion
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
both on the campaign Trail during
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
regular interactions just on a
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
day-to-day basis I hear from
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
constituents and citizens in New
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that they're having difficulty
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
paying their bills with inflation Rising
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
difficulty putting food on the table and
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
gas in the tank these tax cuts are small
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
ways to help them do that small but
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly meaningful ways for the
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
workingclass families of New
 
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I urge you to take a hard
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
look at this look at where New Hampshire
 
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
falls within the communications tax and
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
I'll email this testimony to you
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
given a copy to the clerk already but
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a map in it that shows
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
you where we are in relation to other
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
states in terms of communications tax
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
we've gone up and down the current rate
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
is 7% there's federal tax too uh on top
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
of that as I mentioned last week the
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
meals tax meals and rooms tax revenue
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
has had a significant Surplus uh and
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
should be able to support this small
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
reduction and make us even more
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
competitive with uh the region same with
 
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
the communication tax for many years ago
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
we needed the help building out the 911
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
system which it's done so the job of
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
that is done and it was designed to help
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
support the infrastructure of landlines
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about you but I don't use a
 
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
landline and I haven't used one for a
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
decade so that's it I'll keep it short
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
and sweet on a snowy day but there's uh
 
00:23:52.029 --> 00:23:52.039 align:start position:0%
about a hundred great reasons and ways
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
we can make these tax cuts work they're
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
ramped in and very similar to the
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
package I presented to you last last
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
week it keeps the town holes keeps the
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
towns whole and in fact increases the
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
amount of the percentage of the local
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
distribution as these tax cuts ramp in
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
the meals meals meals tax reduction bill
 
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
from last week set a specific amount as
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
a minimum uh this does it slightly in a
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
slightly different fashion but
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
accomplishes the same objective by
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
increasing the percentage of that
 
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
allocation as the tax comes down the
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
distribution goes
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you represent
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
buery thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question if I uh remember
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
correctly you run a a successful
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
business over in uh uh marac and a bit
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
of an entrepreneur if you if you will
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
use that term um could you kind of
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
explain to us the effect on taxes and
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
how that allows a business to grow or
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow a business to grow and
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
what happens when you cut the taxes uh
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
the previous presenter indicated that
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
the state has received an increase in
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue when taxes went down which seems
 
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
to follow the laugher curve to some
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
degree and that's something we need to
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
be aware of because that allows for some
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
latitude but I'm trying to make sure
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're not going over that that that's a
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
great Point thank you for your question
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative Wy um so it's it's my
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
belief and my experience that when the
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
when the business has a lower tax burden
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
it let lets us put money back into the
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
economy in hiring right that's the the
 
00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
number one asset of any company is its
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
people and if I can hire better people
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
or more people employ more people I
 
00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039 align:start position:0%
stand to be more competitive in the
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
market and with a decreased tax burden
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
on some of the business side I'm able to
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
do that and I'm probably also able to
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
attract them to New Hampshire to reside
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire retire in New Hampshire
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
raise their kids here
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh so I think it has an incredible
 
00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
effect on stimulating the economy and
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
like representative Sweeny before me
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
said uh the net effect is likely to be
 
00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
increased and historically has been
 
00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:11.559 align:start position:0%
increased Revenue to the
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
state thank you Mr chair yes
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um have you
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
looked at the piece written by uh Phil
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
slon of the New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
00:26:28.159 --> 00:26:29.669 align:start position:0%
slon of the New Hampshire fiscal policy
Institute

00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
Institute
 
00:26:34.029 --> 00:26:34.039 align:start position:0%
on on those tax cuts the history of
 
00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
those tax cuts uh Phil slon was a very
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh able state auditor until he moved to
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire fiscal policy
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
Institute he proves pretty
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
conclusively that the tax cuts that we
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
have done so far did
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.669 align:start position:0%
not uh
in

00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
decrease uh that did did not increase
 
00:27:03.159 --> 00:27:04.029 align:start position:0%
decrease uh that did did not increase
our

00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
taxes uh over the over the short or the
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
long run and I think that everybody here
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
should take a look at that before but um
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
I can't say that at this point so do you
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
have you read that thank you
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative all may I'll do you one
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
better I spent a day in the New
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fiscal policy Institute
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
seminar so not only did I listen to to
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
it and disagree with how they propose to
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
spend on numerous numerous social
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
programs that expand government increase
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
the side of size of government increase
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and ultimately increase the
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
tax burden I listened to it for the
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
better part of a day I think some
 
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
members of this committee were at that
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
seminar with me just a few months ago uh
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
and I also did take a look at that paper
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
which I don't believe was peer-reviewed
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
or published in any reputable Economic
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
Journal so I did have a hard look at it
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
and I thank you very much for bringing
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
that up in fact I think everybody should
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
I agree with you take a look at it and
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
also take a look at where that
 
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
particular group uh is advocating that
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
that money gets
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
spent because it's not to make
 
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.310 align:start position:0%
spent because it's not to make
government

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
smaller representative shamberg thank
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
taking this
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
question um so if this tax bill
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
passes the cost of products bought at
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
hardware store Car Sales grocery stores
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
Etc uh will decrease for the consumers
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
at the point of
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
sale tell me your your list of outlets
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
again sorry uh you said car dealers
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
hardware stores hardware stores grocery
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
stores Etc will the cost to the consumer
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
decrease at the point of sale it's it's
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
impossible to predict entirely But
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately yes as you know we don't have
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
a sales tax on groceries or things in
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
the hard ware store uh but ultimately it
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
will decrease the cost of doing business
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh and that makes New Hampshire a better
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
place to live work retire Etc so we you
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
asked you asked about some very specific
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
places where we don't currently have a
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
sales tax as you
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
know that we do either there
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
are taxes they pay as a either bet or
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
BPT or I just would like to know are we
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
going to see cost of products go down
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
with this well I wish I had a crystal
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
ball but I do believe that yes that is
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
the economic theory that yes they they
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
will it will certainly make it a better
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
place to live and more attractive and
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
easier on our consumers who trying to
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
tank yes represent ORS thank you Mr
 
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
question last week we had a young lady
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
in here Hotel owner and her concern was
 
00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
change the tax rates tourists would get
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
confused or be resistant to change and
 
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
it might hurt her business so do you
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
think by reducing this tax or taxes that
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
it's going to help tourism or is it
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
going to diminish tourism or uh slightly
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
less than expected um I so I don't think
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
others will be confused they'll be
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
pleasantly surprised and once word
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
spreads uh it will only
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.230 align:start position:0%
spreads uh it will only
help

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
thanks I'm sorry I don't have a ton more
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
time I've got to get back to to Commerce
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh for a couple of things but I could
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
take one more if there was one
 
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
more any other
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none oh I'm sorry
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um yes one of the
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
statements you made is that you know
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
consumers uh people residents of the
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
state are telling you that they're
 
00:30:52.269 --> 00:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
having a hard time putting um you know
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
meal on the table and paying their bills
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
um when I hear from residents of the
 
00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:00.919 align:start position:0%
state what they're telling me is that
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
their property taxes are too high and
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
that that's what's causing um them to
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
feel insecure being able to maintain
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
their home and also people complain
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
about we know a housing crisis we have a
 
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
housing crisis right now and part of the
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
people who are renting are also having a
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
hard time paying rent and of course in
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
both of those situations a considerable
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
what um they have to pay is property tax
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
so what do you say to Consumers who are
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
telling you that they're having a hard
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
time with their rent or their property
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
tax that's a great question and thank
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
you representative fellow for that
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
question I think that you asked me the
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
same question last week on the the meals
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
tax reduction and I'd say very simply we
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
need to reduce property taxes and do you
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
think it will be uh easier or harder for
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
tenants or residents paying property tax
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
will it be easier for them to pay those
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
property taxes that fund the schools and
 
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
things if they have more money in their
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
pocket through these tax savings I
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
contend that if we put more money in
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
their pocket by reducing these taxes
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
it'll be easier to pay those other taxes
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
where there's quite a bit of resistance
 
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
to reduce property taxes my first choice
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
would be of course reduce property taxes
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
reduce them all reduce them all so
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
that's how I think it'll impact it
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks a lot I appreciate it
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
follow up just focusing on property
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
taxes do you have some suggestions on
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
how to reduce
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
that I think this tax package is a good
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
start uh and that will help bear the
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
burden of paying those property
 
00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:46.389 align:start position:0%
burden of paying those property
taxes

00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank you
 
00:32:51.149 --> 00:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
members thank
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
you okay next up we have uh Greg
 
00:32:56.039 --> 00:33:03.310 align:start position:0%
you okay next up we have uh Greg
Moore

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
committee thanks for the opportunity to
 
00:33:09.629 --> 00:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
speak on this delightful morning uh my
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
name is Greg Moore I'm a regional
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
director for Americans for Prosperity
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to testify in support of
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
1422 I will tell you that when I uh was
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
talking with the sponsor about this
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
legislation I discussed it as a alart
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
menu of tax reductions and I'd like to
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
spend a little bit of time talking about
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
how we prioritize uh the tax
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
reductions as you know this uh Americans
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
for Prosperity led the effort since
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
since 2015 to reduce the BET and
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
BPT and we think that that is the the
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
the right way to start which is a top
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
priority for this committee as you guys
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
are considering your Revenue pictures is
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax the BET has
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
been reduced four times since 2015 the
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
BPT five times since since 2015 and uh
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
we think it's important important signal
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
to small businesses to try to provide
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
them more tax relief BPT does help it
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
does help to create a positive uh
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
economic development in the State uh we
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
think that that's Al also worthwhile
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
Endeavor the the two consumer taxes
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
while we we think it's great that we put
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
more money into pockets of of granted
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
Staters and I think that's critical at
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
time when inflation has been what it's
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
been through the last few years uh
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately we don't see them as having
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
the same multiplier effects as a bet and
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
a BPT so uh we view them as probably the
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
the as less important as far as this tax
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
tax package go so um that's our view
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
from from from Americans for Prosperity
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
I have a couple things that i' want to
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
point out uh first and
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
foremost um I did read the fiscal policy
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
Institute study I have some concerns
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
with with the way it was laid out that
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
was those concerns are born from
 
00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
somebody who has been trying to put
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
together a study over the Arc of the
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
last seven or eight years I've struggled
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
to find an economist who'd be willing to
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
take it they listed out a number of
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
issues and variables that would have to
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
be factored into it and in reading the
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
study by the fiscal policy Institute
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
none of those appear to have been uh
 
00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
considered in in the process that's why
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
I have some concerns with that study and
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
then finally I'd like to point out that
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
as someone who worked at
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
HHS uh and knows how at the state level
 
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
how we treated Federal money
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
the concern for the state sending
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
subsidies to local cities and towns I I
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
think it's a little bit I I ask myself
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
why would cities and towns treat State
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
money any differently than than the
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
state agencies treat Federal money and
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
that is and that is they don't put as
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
much scrutiny into into the expenditure
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
of it as they do the money that they
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
have to raise in taxes by themselves so
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh one reason why I think
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
that just focusing on state subsidies to
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns is often misguided
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
and and often does doesn't lead to the
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
most efficient valuable use of resources
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd be happy to take any
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um I have one um I
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
missed one point I think you said was it
 
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
the communication Services tax that you
 
00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
said was a little lower in your priority
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes communication Services tax and
 
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
even even uh even the meals and rentals
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
tax the meals and rentals tax uh I've
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
talked to a number of of uh people in
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
that in in the hospitality industry they
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
indicated to me that that the reduction
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
from 9 to 8 and a half really hasn't
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
spurred any additional growth uh on
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
their on their side now we have seen
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
more Revenue but that largely has to do
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
with the fact that the just food prices
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic have spiked and that
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
has driven up overall Revenue as well as
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
labor prices have spiked so as a as a
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
consequence we're getting more Revenue
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh because they've had to drive their
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
increase their their cost but uh they
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
don't attribute any additional uh growth
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of volume as a result of the
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
reduction from 9 to 8 and a half okay
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes representative shamberg
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Moore
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
for taking this question would a more
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
effective relief for businesses be a
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
safe harbor approach versus a reduction
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
percentage reduction to protect
 
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
society the complications of tax policy
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
you're right there there a lot of
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
different ways to skin a cat and I and
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question but there are
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of ways to skin a cat um we think
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
we think just an overall rate reduction
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
s sends a better signal particularly to
 
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.470 align:start position:0%
s sends a better signal particularly to
small

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
businesses yes representative
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
Yori thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr Moore
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
the question has been raised regarding
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh property taxes and and and they're
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
increasing in
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
in the appropriation of that in addition
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
we have an inflation action that's
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
taking taking place because of an
 
00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.630 align:start position:0%
taking taking place because of an
increase

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
in paper money that's been
 
00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:04.230 align:start position:0%
in paper money that's been
created

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
which to some degree accounts for the
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
increased Revenue numbers that you just
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
just mentioned with meals and rooms but
 
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
who has the ultimate control over how
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
much the property tax is that the state
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire or is that the
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
municipal government in New Hampshire
 
00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
including School
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
Board absolutely complicated question
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
because of course the Dr sets the final
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
rate so I don't want to exclude that
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
point but but ultimately the spending is
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
being driven at the local level and we
 
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
have seen significant increases I know
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
that um someone who's in the room who uh
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
works for a different organization
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak on a different bill
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
has spent a fair amount of time looking
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
at the the increaseing and gross in in
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
education budgets at the local level um
 
00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:53.079 align:start position:0%
and and he's written some pretty
 
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
compelling papers as to why that should
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
be the focus area for those folks who
 
00:38:59.470 --> 00:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
are really concerned about property
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no more questions thank
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
you uh the last pin card I have right
 
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
now is um Lauren O Sullivan and Kean
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:35.109 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
yes could they start by telling us what
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
they just changed they've sent us around
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
note so uh the change on the fiscal note
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
just corrects a couple of typos that
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
were in the published fiscal note oh and
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
none of them are significant to our
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that is correct okay thank
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
you so for the record uh good morning my
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
name is Lauren O Sullivan I am the
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
senior Financial Analyst at the
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue and I'm Kim Mong tax policy
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
council with the Dr um the department
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
does not have a position on the bill uh
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
we did prepare a fiscal note on the bill
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
and uh we had uh distributed the the uh
 
00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal no quick guide to the committee
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
um before the weekend um just I guess
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
just a quick recap on the bill um so the
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
the bill reduces the U the tax rates for
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
the BPT bet um the CST and then up to a
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh repeal of the
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
CST uh the reduction in the M&amp;R rate uh
 
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
an increase in the distribution to the
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh mun Municipal um uh mpal revenue
 
00:40:59.290 --> 00:40:59.300 align:start position:0%
account and then
 
00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.870 align:start position:0%
account and then
[Music]

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and in the fiscal noqu guide you will
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
see that we have prepared a uh sort of a
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
summary sheet in terms of the fiscal
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
impact of all the uh the combined um
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
adjustments that would be made to the
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
rates the just a few points that we
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out is uh just the uh
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
the mechanical um I guess the technical
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
ISS issues that we've identified through
 
00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.270 align:start position:0%
ISS issues that we've identified through
the

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
bill first off is the uh for
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
CST um that we would suggest a an
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
applicable uh taxable period beginning
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
date so for uh for the rate reduction we
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
would propose a uh the taxable period
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
beginning on or after July 1 2024 that's
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
in consistent with the the language uh
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
of what we see that the intent of the
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
bill is and then for the repeal will be
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh the the language would be something
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
like the taxable periods beginning on or
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
after gen 1 of
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
2027 there is also other um other parts
 
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:08.839 align:start position:0%
of the the CST in the uh in the statutes
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
that CST touches so we have actually uh
 
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.349 align:start position:0%
that CST touches so we have actually uh
compile

00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
compile
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
that uh all the xray language where uh
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
all the other CST Parts would be
 
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
touching but not within the CST statute
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
itself this essentially is uh take
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
lifted from uh I believe it was a house
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
bill one or House Bill two a few years
 
00:42:32.589 --> 00:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
ago um from uh where there was I might
 
00:42:34.589 --> 00:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
have been last session actually uh for
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
the when the uh one of the bills was uh
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
suggesting proposing the repeal of the
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
CST so that's a list of the additional
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
language that we thought that should be
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
in there as
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
well and the other item is for the
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R uh
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
tax one of the items that we thought uh
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
the timing of the uh the the rate
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
reduction would be a bit too quick as uh
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
not the rate reduction but the the
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
exclusion of the uh taxable meals of a
 
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
dollar or less from the uh from uh
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
taxable M&amp;R we thought that potentially
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
that the timing might be a bit too short
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
notice for The Operators to implement so
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
maybe to extend that a bit further out
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
um we also had some concerns that
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
potentially um that operators might not
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
be able to implement the uh the zero tax
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
on taxable meals of less than a dollar
 
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
from the other items of um meals taxable
 
00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
meals that that they sell
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
um and then one other thing is just the
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh the applicable taxable period uh
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
language uh something to do with the uh
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
you know to to match it with a with a
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
taxable period so the suggest that with
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%
a pushout date potentially something on
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Aly yes I'd
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
just like to check um you use uh when
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking at business taxes you go
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
back to
 
00:44:31.150 --> 00:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
um the time when the business tax
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
revenue had been thoroughly completely
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
audited so we so you calculated the cost
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
of the BET BP changes based on FY
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
21 22 21 I think but 2122 I did it I did
 
00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:56.599 align:start position:0%
it the right way when I did it um does
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
it make sense to you that given all of
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
the inflation and everything including
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
our taxes uh that on the on the
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
2122 um cost should be adjusted for the
 
00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.230 align:start position:0%
2122 um cost should be adjusted for the
2324

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
2324
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
inflation up thank you for the question
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
I think that that's an excellent point
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
um as you know that we can only
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
project um calculations using static
 
00:45:33.549 --> 00:45:33.559 align:start position:0%
analysis um and we did use the texia 21
 
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
data and that is uh returns Tex year TX
 
00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:40.599 align:start position:0%
year 2021 returns that have been
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
submitted up to and that would be the
 
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.510 align:start position:0%
submitted up to and that would be the
like

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
the that we use the the tax year 2021 uh
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
return data and that would be the the
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
most recent uh full tax year uh data
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
that we would have received received um
 
00:45:59.710 --> 00:45:59.720 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayers
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
um yes potentially uh with with know
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
inflation rates and then uh change in
 
00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:09.559 align:start position:0%
tax laws from 21 through 22 all all that
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
would potentially change the uh the
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact um
 
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
however we were not able to to adjust
 
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
those calculations um further thank you
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
and those would have been primarily
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
collected in fiscal years 22 and 23 as
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
well as refunded in 23
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
forward yes I know it gets really
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
complicated yeah that's why we like to
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
use the tax year because that's the most
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
complete set and everyone is on the same
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
law that year thank you but then we're
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
behind representative shamber thank you
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking this
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
question on table 8 says the cumulative
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
estimated impact per year
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
then you give us a total six years out I
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
realize it could be up or down you're
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
not sure but is that $2 billion change
 
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
over these next six
 
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:10.510 align:start position:0%
years is estimated by the
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.109 align:start position:0%
years is estimated by the
[Music]

00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
Dr on the revised schedule I guess it is
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
yes I just want to make sure I'm reading
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
this right two billion
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
so uh for some of the proposals those
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
are fully realized prior to 2031 so
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
you'll notice like um for example like
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
the BET rate change you'll see that's
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
pretty static from fiscal years 29 30
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
and 31 so really um when when you get to
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
that two billion at that point those
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
numbers may very well be I guess baked
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
into those business decisions in those
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
years and how the um how much tax is
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:03.559 align:start position:0%
UL just because it's not there those
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
figures when you talk about them being
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
baked in your comment regarding baked in
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
is the closest you can get to uh a uh an
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
aggressive uh analysis of potential
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
business activities other than that
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
these figures are arithmetic or a static
 
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:25.640 align:start position:0%
correct display uh assuming no change
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
changes in current behavior and then but
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
when you use the term baked in you're
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
assuming a business
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
Behavior so that is correct yes for for
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
when we start forecasting out okay I
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we all
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
understand that their that their U
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
crystal ball is cloudy as so is ours
 
00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.150 align:start position:0%
crystal ball is cloudy as so is ours
makes

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.829 align:start position:0%
makes
our

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative fellows um yes
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
this this is not really a question about
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
this particular bill but I do have a
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
question about the document here that
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
says fiscal note quick guide and it it
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
references well it has the bill number
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
now but it it also has the the LSR
 
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
number and that there are
 
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations in here that
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
are they're tech technical kinds of
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
things and that they're not in the
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so I was surprised to see
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
this because my understanding was that
 
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
technical issues are supposed to be in
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note and so I I just don't
 
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
know this pops up and I don't know kind
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
of like why it's here and how when I was
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
this available earlier that kind of
 
00:49:48.589 --> 00:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
question that is a an excellent question
 
00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:50.799 align:start position:0%
rep representative fellow uh so when
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
when the Dr prepares the fiscal note
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
upon request from the OS
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
uh sorry from the LBA uh we prepare it
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
with a form that has one section of the
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
form has is the technical defects uh
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
tech technical mechan mechanical defects
 
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
and we submit that to the LBA and the
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that is attached to the
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
back of the bill is a summary from the
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
LBA from what we've submitted and um and
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
for our purposes we thought that um all
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
the other point that so some of the
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
points that we made on our submission to
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
the LBA might not have made it into the
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal note at the back of the bill and
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
that's why we prepar a fiscal not Quake
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
guide just for a complete um
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
picture follow up so and so this is the
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
quick notes when when you bring them
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
because I assume sometimes you don't
 
00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:49.160 align:start position:0%
think there's any need to do that you
 
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
know if there isn't any any um correct
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
when big issue so then we we I'm trying
 
00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
to find out when we would likely see
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
this so this is a time when you testify
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
that we you would bring this if you
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
thought it had additional information
 
00:51:07.789 --> 00:51:07.799 align:start position:0%
yes additional information that was not
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note at the back of the
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
bill um that we have identified dur when
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
we were reviewing the uh proposed
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh so we we will bring
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
it and we would testify to it follow up
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
just one tiny followup um would you have
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
shared this with um well this is this is
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
the second version of this bill but
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
would you have shared this with with the
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor if if they had asked or uh
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
we only submit that to the LBA so I I do
 
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
not know the process between the LBA and
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
the prime
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Aly thank you
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
just um since we're talking with the Dr
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
I think maybe I can give a little bit of
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
History this committee requested the
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
quick notes quite a long long time ago
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
now we did it because the fiscal notes
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
themselves were a lot shorter than they
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
are now but it still I think serves a
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
purpose they are providing it for each
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
bill they were in your email last
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
week I forget when in your email
 
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
but thank you any other questions of the
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
Dr okay thank
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
you I now have one additional uh pink
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:42.910 align:start position:0%
 
heck

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
heck good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I did not plan
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
to testify today in your inbox you will
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
see an email for me um because it's very
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
Sim it would have been very similar to
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
my prior testimony and I was concerned
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
with the beautiful weather which is
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
great for our tourism industry that I
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
might not make it here today but thank
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
you for being here I did feel compelled
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I explain to things
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
that I heard um and questions asked
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
around so there's no confusion how this
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
works on the municipal side around the
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
meals and
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
rooms so while we don't have a position
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
on the policy piece of the bill and we
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
continue to appreciate that the sponsor
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
has made sure that the municipal side
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
would remain whole um it was said in
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
testimony that municipalities are less
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
deliberate I'm paraphrasing with the use
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
of these funds um how the municipal
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
budget is set is revenues and expenses
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
don't really talk to each other they
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
only talk twice a year what you raise in
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate what you approve in our
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
budgets is in a a calculation over here
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
and the revenues are over here so we
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
typically estimate what revenues might
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
be during the budget process just
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
because we get more Revenue in that
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
gives us no legal authority to spend
 
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
those dollars so they are as I showed
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
you on the last uh sheet that was handed
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
out they would be applied as Revenue in
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
the tax rate setting time so for example
 
00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.710 align:start position:0%
the tax rate setting time so for example
in

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
2021 um the prior year a city or town
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
would look at what their distribution
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
was and from 2017 to 2021 it was 68.8
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
Million Statewide they would have used
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
that number to estimate their revenue
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
when they were setting their budget then
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
the law change
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
and we see in 2022 we got $100 million
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
that additional Revenue was reported on
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
the MS 434 when we set our tax rate and
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
went to immediate property tax reduction
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
so there was no ability to spend more
 
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
money or be less deliberate with the
 
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
budget and the second thing I did want
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
to cover is that the four rates the four
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
tax rates are municipal rate it I
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
suppose you could have a village
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
District too the school the swept the
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
State education rate the county and and
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
potentially a village District if you
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
have one in your community or more are
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
set separately with their own
 
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
calculations meals and rooms only
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
impacts the municipal tax rate
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
collection and I heard the school was
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
brought up and I wanted to just C
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
clarify that so I did want to let you
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
know that anytime we receive more money
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
and meals in rooms that than what we
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
anticipated and we estimate
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
conservatively but every year that's
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
gone up that has been direct property
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
tax relief during the tax rate setting
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
in December so thank you and I can
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
certainly take any questions thank you
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
um do you have a position on the bill so
 
00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:34.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have an official position on
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
the bill other than we would are
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
concerned about the municipal portion
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
and as you debate and deliberate the
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill that you consider the potential
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
impacts um potentially if there was an
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
economic downturn or some major change
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
in our New Hampshire economy that could
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
impact the municipal rates because as I
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
explained um these dollars do go
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
directly to offsetting the tax rate and
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
they cannot be spent outside of the
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
budget or in addition to the budget
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
process much unlike our home checkbooks
 
00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
what it our process works quite
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
differently um in
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
government thank you yes representa ORS
 
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
question so in your testimony if meals
 
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:18.039 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax goes up or down is there a
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
correlation as how much money comes into
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
our treasury or is it that it's
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
consistently going up no matter what
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
just it's the trend that people want to
 
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:32.039 align:start position:0%
eat out more whatever so currently um
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
under the law change in 2021 House Bill
 
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
2 changed the entire meals and rooms
 
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
formula so it used to be that the
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
legislature decided a set amount based
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
on what it felt that it could afford to
 
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
share back with cities and towns it was
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
statutorily set at 40% and it was waved
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
every single budget year um for decades
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
and it would range from 17 to 22% of
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
what was collected but it was a set
 
00:57:02.829 --> 00:57:02.839 align:start position:0%
dollar amount under the new law change
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
we now receive 30% of what was actually
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
collected so as the funds are collected
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
every month the treasurer deposits them
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
into what a dedicated fund that was
 
00:57:16.109 --> 00:57:16.119 align:start position:0%
created so if the state is doing better
 
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
we do better um if the state is is you
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
know which has not happened yet and I I
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
don't think it will let's hope then we
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
would receive less money and both of
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
those would have a direct impact as I
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
stated on the local tax property tax
 
00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:33.039 align:start position:0%
right so if we receive less that that
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
less revenue is going to be um
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
potentially impacting our tax rate
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
because we anticipated more revenue and
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
most cities and towns use probably a
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
three to five year running average so
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
that they can conservatively estimate
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
going into the budget season so they're
 
00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
not overestimating taxes and then it's
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
always a happy surprise and it is of
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
note that we set our budgets usually at
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
at this time of year right and
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
everything has to be set for our public
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
hearings in that February March time
 
00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
frame some are a little bit later but we
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't find out our distribution amounts
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
until the tax rate is set in October so
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have a way there's no changes
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
that can be made once the budget is set
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
so typically again this really does go
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
to tax relief especially if we're
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
receiving additional funds which we have
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
been representative YY thank you Mr
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned an economic downturn uh
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
reducing uh revenues uh the the amount
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
of money received by the towns and
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
cities under any scheme would go down in
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
an economic downturn because everything
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
is going down so the application of an
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
economic downturn or fear that's in air
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
quotes uh of an economic downturn
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any application because
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen regardless of the
 
00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
system that takes place is that a
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
correct analysis I would say that
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
generally that's a correct statement but
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
in analyzing the two bills that we have
 
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
before us we know that if we were
 
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
already make a reduction to a the tax
 
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
contributing to it combined with an
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
economic downturn that would be
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
exacerbated but you are correct
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative representative fellows
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
the charts that we're looking at in here
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
refer to M&amp;R tax but it's really the
 
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
case that the tax that those two taxes
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
are not the same they're not the same
 
00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.309 align:start position:0%
are not the same they're not the same
rate

00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
and I was under the impression that the
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
the revenue raised from
 
00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
rooms is now going to the education
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund is that not true is that the
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
way it was or is that the way it is now
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
or may maybe Dr should I I think Dr
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
should should answer that question
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
because I think there's some carve outs
 
01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:05.799 align:start position:0%
on how that works I think there's a
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
percentage carve out and I don't want to
 
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
misrepresent any
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
statements and I have not time I haven't
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
had time to analyze the updated fiscal
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
information provided this
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
morning thank you thank you very
 
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
much and just for the note um Katherine
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
is from the nhma I don't know if you
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned that or not New Hampshire
 
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.309 align:start position:0%
mentioned that or not New Hampshire
Municipal

01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
Association okay I have no other pink
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
cards on hb1 1422 is there anyone else
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
who wishes to speak on the
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill can I can I get an answer to that
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
question from Dr that's a good point um
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:01:00.510 align:start position:0%
 
distribution

01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
question so so we have charts in in the
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal note talking about
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R and the distribution of that and
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about how much goes to
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities I I thought that I read
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere recently and I thought it was
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
from the budget that we passed that all
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
of the room tax is now going to the
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
education trust fund in the so going to
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund is the rentals
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
tax which we also call the vehicles
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
vehicle vehicle um that 100% goes to the
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so that's vehicle
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
rentals and it it is it yeah so the
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
rooms piece is what we would call the
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
occupancy and that stays in the general
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
fund before any additional carve outs to
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
the municipal Revenue fund and so forth
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
so that vehicle fund is it's not part of
 
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
room and meals it's this whole separate
 
01:02:11.549 --> 01:02:11.559 align:start position:0%
tax um no it is part of the it is part
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
of the tax but that portion the way that
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
our tax form is set up we can identify
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
that and are then able to put that into
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so there's
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
Dr okay thank you very much I'm going to
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:03:00.230 align:start position:0%
 
public

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
good okay I'm going to open the public
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
and uh later on representative Aly I
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
will need a pink card oh but I don't
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
need one right this minute thank you uh
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll start with representative
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
Aly to introduce the
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
um this is uh representative Susan
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
Aly Grafton County city of
 
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
Lebanon um I am the prime sponsor of
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
house bill for 1492 relative to the rate
 
01:03:58.150 --> 01:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
and exemptions of the interest and
 
01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
dividends tax um I hadn't quite realized
 
01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
because things have been very
 
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
messy uh so far this year on that
 
01:04:10.359 --> 01:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
messy uh so far this year on that
the

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.430 align:start position:0%
the
uh

01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
the drafter stripped out my purpose
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
clause which was at the beginning of
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
this so to the extent that I can
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
remember um I want to tell you what that
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.549 --> 01:04:39.559 align:start position:0%
this um the interest in dividends tax is
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
the only one that taxes a large number
 
01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.349 align:start position:0%
the only one that taxes a large number
of

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
retired um
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
citizens that are only receiving or
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
mostly re receiving interest in
 
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
dividends uh it is because of that and a
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
misconception that was conveyed to this
 
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee a long time ago that uh half
 
01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
of the people paying the interest in
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
dividends tax are poor
 
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
elderly that on
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
WE avoided increasing the exemptions
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
over the
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
years uh but
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
the interest the the tax on those Rich
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
elderly of whom I know a fair number uh
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
that uh have especially the ones that
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
have moved into this state but also the
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
ones that are are living in retirement
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
without other income or without uh with
 
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
significant income from on interest
 
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
dividends and distribution
 
01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.589 align:start position:0%
dividends and distribution
uh

01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:57.599 --> 01:05:59.190 align:start position:0%
uh
that

01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
we have um damn I'm I'm really tired
 
01:06:04.599 --> 01:06:07.470 align:start position:0%
we have um damn I'm I'm really tired
today

01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
um that this is in Viola removing this
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
tax is in violation of our
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
constitution our constitution mentions
 
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
taxes twice the first time is in the
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights at the beginning and and
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
it says that every citizen shall share
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
an equal burden of the cost of the
 
01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
government services that all of us enjoy
 
01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:38.839 align:start position:0%
whether you enjoy them or not uh but our
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
department of justice our department our
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:45.640 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh which is currently
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what to do about
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
our roads uh and a lot of and the rest
 
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
of our government are important to all
 
01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.150 align:start position:0%
of our government are important to all
of

01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:06:58.710 --> 01:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
us um unless you want to just sit in
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
your house every time it snows and never
 
01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
go out um so the second place that it
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
mentions it is in the mechanics of
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
government in part two and in the Clause
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
that also includes the the adequate
 
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
education part uh it says that we can
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
impose those taxes that are reasonable
 
01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.069 align:start position:0%
impose those taxes that are reasonable
and

01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
proportional uh now proportional means
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
equal rate we can only have one rate in
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
this state reasonable means exemptions
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
essentially uh it means that if the
 
01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
person that you are taxing or the
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
business you are taxing would uh be
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
incapable of sustaining itself
 
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
um or rather a class of businesses would
 
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
be capable of sustaining
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
itself uh because you are taxing
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
it then we don't want to do that because
 
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to pay for the
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
person to go into the poor house and we
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
are going to no longer have that class
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
of businesses if we're taxing
 
01:08:24.070 --> 01:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
it so by class at this point
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
interpreting it the way that we are not
 
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to to do this say um
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
cleaners of your
 
01:08:36.669 --> 01:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
houses uh or of a
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
hospital uh lowly
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
paid on nurses lowly paid teachers lowly
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
paid um legal
 
01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.390 align:start position:0%
paid um legal
assistance

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
uh there is a whole range of people
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
pay money to to take care of things for
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
us and the money is insufficient to
 
01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.070 align:start position:0%
us and the money is insufficient to
their

01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
livelihood the these people including
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
some in the middle
 
01:09:18.749 --> 01:09:18.759 align:start position:0%
class uh I think of it as up to 40% of
 
01:09:18.759 --> 01:09:19.829 align:start position:0%
class uh I think of it as up to 40% of
our

01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
population uh are not benefiting
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
from uh are are benefiting from parts
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
from taxation are paying taxes in
 
01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.709 align:start position:0%
from taxation are paying taxes in
various

01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
various
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
ways through
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
rent through um their tobacco
 
01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
addiction um
 
01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.149 align:start position:0%
addiction um
through

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh on going to McDonald's to get a warm
 
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
meal once a day um
 
01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
and they are part of our society we
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
cannot live without those
 
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
cleaners we cannot live
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
without uh a lot of the people that are
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
ass in assisting in
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
construction uh but that are paid lowly
 
01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
enough that if we were taxing them we'd
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
problem but what we do have is
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
have had is taxes a wide variety of
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
taxes that keep us from the government
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
from going
 
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
under um that have
 
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.270 align:start position:0%
under um that have
been

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
created in order to provide enough money
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
to the government to keep the the
 
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.910 align:start position:0%
to the government to keep the the
government

01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.630 align:start position:0%
government
alive

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
alive
 
01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.669 align:start position:0%
alive
and

01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
the destruction of the interest in
 
01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
dividends tax says that well really
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
wealthy people most if you look at the
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
chart that I passed out which I now I
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
didn't remember last night that I had
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
already printed it out I've now got
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
extra copies if anybody wants more um
 
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
but uh on the chart shows you that
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
most of the money of the interest in
 
01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.270 align:start position:0%
most of the money of the interest in
dividends

01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
tax has been coming from about 2,000
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
people in the state who
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
have over um
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.390 align:start position:0%
 
Investments

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
so they are capable of contributing to
 
01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:55.870 align:start position:0%
so they are capable of contributing to
our

01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
society but it as we get rid of this
 
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
tax they will be scot-free
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
and fair number of them are people who
 
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.030 align:start position:0%
and fair number of them are people who
moved

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
moved
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
here after their profitable
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
years and um and
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
settled so that is really
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional the other Factor in
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
$140,000 I mean sorry uh a million uh
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
$140 million doar in this
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
tax because the rich people in this
 
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
country have been increasing their
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
wealth relative to everybody else for
 
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.790 align:start position:0%
wealth relative to everybody else for
some

01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
time and partly because of our tax
 
01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
time and partly because of our tax
structure

01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
structure
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
nationally and
 
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
locally uh if if we get rid of this tax
 
01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:05.080 align:start position:0%
they they will not the a lot of the
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
wealthiest people will no longer be
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
contributing um to what is left of our
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
government if you I'm not going to talk
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
about the other bill here but um
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
but we cannot
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
survive without the people at the lower
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
Spectrum we our hospitals will fall
 
01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
apart uh everybody will have to start
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
taking of their care of their own houses
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
um there will not be a lot of people in
 
01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.189 align:start position:0%
um there will not be a lot of people in
this

01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:50.199 --> 01:13:52.030 align:start position:0%
this
state

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
that uh like others that have gone
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
before them have decided to move out
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
because they cannot afford the property
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
tax in the
 
01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.669 align:start position:0%
tax in the
state

01:14:03.669 --> 01:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh or to move away from our Urban
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
centers like
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
Lebanon because they cannot afford the
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
increasing property tax that is taking
 
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
care of the services in the outling
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
communities uh I've been home for 29
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
years now I think it is and I have
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
watched Lebanon lose its middle class
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
because of this on we have to remember
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
that there aren't just the rich people
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
here and the rich people can't live by
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
themselves they get a lot of help from
 
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
people that they
 
01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
people that they
pay

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
so um that is why I am putting in a
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
reinstatement of the interest in
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
dividends tax but also be why I
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
completely on with the help of Dr
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
completely rewrote uh the interest in
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
dividends TX it was 100 years old last
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
year instead of building it um on re re
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
um revising it as they went along They
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
just added sections onto it it is pretty
 
01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to read to figure out what you
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
have to do and there all there were also
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
things in it that are um not done
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
anymore they are archaic they have
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
disappeared and uh we verified that with
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
the Auditors uh before removing them
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
from from this
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
document um and I put on on everybody's
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
desks for your
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
enjoyment the um side by side which Dr
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
did for me uh the side by side of the
 
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
two of the old tax and the new tax so
 
01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
that you can see where everything moved
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
to and from what got
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
deleted and completely and on the one
 
01:16:22.719 --> 01:16:23.790 align:start position:0%
deleted and completely and on the one
section

01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
that is in common with the previous bill
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:16:32.189 --> 01:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
ited uh last week
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
um that um triples the exemptions to the
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax because as far
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
as I can tell it's been at least 40
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
years since we increased those
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
exemptions and the tripling actually
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite do it but I'm not really
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
sure about what the date that they they
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
changed it
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
so uh tripling the
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
exemptions I figured out from the
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
triangles and it probably is wrong but
 
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
um it's in the fiscal note that we got
 
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
um I believe except that they didn't say
 
01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
how much is coming off uh but I I think
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
it's about $5
 
01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
about about 30 million not 30 million
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
30,000 people that really should not be
 
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
paying that have been paying or in the
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
case of half of them have been reporting
 
01:17:54.629 --> 01:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to pay anything
 
01:17:58.390 --> 01:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
um for years now because we had not
 
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
increased the exemptions the way we have
 
01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
been learning to increase the uh
 
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
exemptions for business profits business
 
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
Enterprise and so forth um for the
 
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
businesses and which does keep the small
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
businesses that have been talked about
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh otherwise um out of the equation of
 
01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:40.120 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to bring forward
 
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
was what happened in
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
December in
 
01:18:48.629 --> 01:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
December the our business
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
taxes filed they were supposed to file
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
$13.5 million uh dollar of business
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
profits and business Enterprise tax
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
according to our plan for the first time
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
they went below
 
01:19:07.679 --> 01:19:09.430 align:start position:0%
they went below
plan

01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
plan
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh half of of that below was apparently
 
01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.830 align:start position:0%
uh half of of that below was apparently
um

01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
the our attempt in this committee to
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
remove um the huge amount of surplus
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
taxes that are sitting in the treasury
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh that are not being used and that we
 
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
might lose any day if their businesses
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
come and say we need that many because
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
we're in the recession now um so uh
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's yet another issue that gets
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
complicating things
 
01:19:54.510 --> 01:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
but we are below plan by 99.6% and the
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
plan did include looking at those refund
 
01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:01.719 align:start position:0%
possibilities um
 
01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
so this is the first time we don't know
 
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
if it's going to continue from now
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
through the end of this fiscal year but
 
01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
we have made a lot of changes cuts and
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
structural changes to the business
 
01:20:20.189 --> 01:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
taxes and
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
possibilities and probabilities that
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
those are going to have a negative
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
effect on our business tax revenues the
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
business tax revenues are a
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
structure and I would very much like to
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
know from anybody that wants to keep
 
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
cutting what you think we're going to
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
cut out of state government and as it
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
stands so
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
think oh no um the last one that I I
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
gave you besides the Dr
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
material uh is
 
01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.430 align:start position:0%
material uh is
um

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
the is
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
a document that was written by Phil slon
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
for this bill about the history of rates
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
and file file
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
thresholds which I haven't had a chance
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
to read yet
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
myself on and he gave it to me this
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
morning and said he has a meeting at
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
10:00 so he wouldn't be able to be
 
01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.189 align:start position:0%
10:00 so he wouldn't be able to be
here

01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
so um that I think is also worth reading
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
Phil slon is a was a very good auditor
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
and he is a very good
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit uh so I'm not sure if he's
 
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
ever going to be submitting
 
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
to um to an economics
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
paper but maybe he should be doing that
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
at this point so that you people can no
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
longer say that it hasn't been been um
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
so um that's I don't want to go any
 
01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
further on this I probably could but
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sure we'll have uh we'll
 
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
be discussing this quite a bit in work
 
01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
session as well um it looks like we may
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
have a question for you uh
 
01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.790 align:start position:0%
have a question for you uh
representative

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
ulery thank you
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
s the section of the Constitution that
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
you quote also contains the phrases for
 
01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.430 align:start position:0%
you quote also contains the phrases for
specific

01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
uses and further down it also says that
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
if the taxpayer the citizen the resident
 
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
of of New Hampshire if they don't get
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
anything from they have no obligation
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
to there has to be an
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
equivalency I pay for taxes I get a for
 
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
On The Border to protect me from Indians
 
01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:20.199 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
time you know for number
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
four um just as an example the
 
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.149 align:start position:0%
four um just as an example the
equivalency

01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
equivalency
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
today would
 
01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.870 align:start position:0%
today would
be

01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
what the the equivalency today is
 
01:23:38.159 --> 01:23:40.350 align:start position:0%
what the the equivalency today is
totally

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
totally
 
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
impossible and I may not
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
need a
 
01:23:49.950 --> 01:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
court uh that is going to listen to me
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
in neutral fashion and um uh agree that
 
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
I'm being prosecuted for wrongly right
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
now uh but I may need it
 
01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
later or I may have needed it
 
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
earlier on but that Court protects me
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
from a whole lot of things as does the
 
01:24:19.149 --> 01:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office as do um the
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
police on the street who are trying to
 
01:24:22.159 --> 01:24:23.629 align:start position:0%
police on the street who are trying to
keep

01:24:23.629 --> 01:24:23.639 align:start position:0%
keep
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
keep somebody from robbing me or killing
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
me on the
 
01:24:28.239 --> 01:24:30.709 align:start position:0%
me on the
street

01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
street
 
01:24:30.719 --> 01:24:32.750 align:start position:0%
street
uh

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
and government has changed an awful lot
 
01:24:38.109 --> 01:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
over the
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
centuries I do not believe in the form
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
of originalism that the Supreme Court
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
seems to be trying to imply now but you
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
cannot equate for
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
instance a AK-47 or whatever it is with
 
01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
instance a AK-47 or whatever it is with
a

01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.669 --> 01:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
load should we discuss this during work
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
session instead or do you have a
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.709 --> 01:25:19.719 align:start position:0%
build works thank you sir any other
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
and if you could fill out a pink card
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
representative Aly that would be
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
great um Greg Moore I don't think he's
 
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
here he filled out a card I think he's
 
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
he had to go somewhere
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
else uh next up we have
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
bramy thank you Mr chair and uh hello to
 
01:25:52.109 --> 01:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
everybody good to always good to be back
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh I was former uh ways of means member
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
for 12 years I've I've testified here
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
before but I'm actually here
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
representing the granite state taxpayer
 
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
Group which is a group that was founded
 
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
decades ago by meldam Thompson Governor
 
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
Thompson um before I get going um uh
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
Representatives fellows I haven't had
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
the the uh the uh Revenue Focus from uh
 
01:26:23.109 --> 01:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
this last month the uh rman meals
 
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
tax uh for Education was 5.5 million as
 
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:29.719 align:start position:0%
compared to 175 million Revenue so I
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
just want to point that's a very small
 
01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
total from so yes you're right that 5.5
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
does go to something else it goes to
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
education but okay
 
01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
education but okay
so

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm here I was here when we first put
 
01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
a plan in place to to reduce and
 
01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
eliminate the interest in dividends tax
 
01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm not a I'm not a as a legislator
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
I was never a a just reduce reduce
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
reduce kind of guy I always wanted to do
 
01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
it in a on a phased way based on what we
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
thought revenues were going to
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
be um and even the way the phase out was
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
it was over a fiveyear period making it
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
it's always a good thing to phas things
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
in just in
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
case and the reason we did that back
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
then was back in 21 fiscal
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
21 uh our our total revenues increased
 
01:27:29.709 --> 01:27:29.719 align:start position:0%
were above plan by
 
01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
11.6% and then when we went to fiscal
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
22's revenues that increased another $
 
01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.669 align:start position:0%
22's revenues that increased another $
264.7

01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
264.7
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
million and most of that was business
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
taxes uh in fiscal 21 the the plan was
 
01:27:52.639 --> 01:27:53.550 align:start position:0%
taxes uh in fiscal 21 the the plan was
for

01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:57.790 --> 01:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
$786 million of business tax but we
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
actually had we wand up with
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
$991 point4 million in in tax or a
 
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
difference of
 
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.709 align:start position:0%
difference of
$25

01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
$25
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
million but then when we go to the next
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that went up another
 
01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.910 align:start position:0%
fiscal year that went up another
$22.8

01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
$22.8
 
01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.470 align:start position:0%
$22.8
million

01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:28:19.109 --> 01:28:19.119 align:start position:0%
so we talked for years about we don't
 
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
have an income tax and then people who
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
moved here
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
would say wait a minute I'm getting
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
taxed on I'm getting taxed on my
 
01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends isn't that income
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
well it's income but not not earned
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
income it's income from dividends and
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
interest so we thought at the time this
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
was a good idea let's do it now because
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
all these other revenues are so strong
 
01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
this is the time to to make the move uh
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did then after I left
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
the legisl
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
I guess it was last year where we
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
accelerated that and uh to uh be done by
 
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
the end of this year right now it's
 
01:29:03.149 --> 01:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
three well last year was 4% this year
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
it's 3% and by uh January 1 of uh next
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
year it'll be
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
zero now as far as unconstitutionality s
 
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative Aly I mean you also said
 
01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
this this tax has been around for 100
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
years boy you think someone would have
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
figured that one out by now
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh so I mean it's it's I don't think
 
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.550 align:start position:0%
uh so I mean it's it's I don't think
it's

01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh so I don't know if I
 
01:29:31.229 --> 01:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
I agree with that that
 
01:29:33.229 --> 01:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
argument and the other thing about all
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
of our revenues and I'm going to talk in
 
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
a minute about where we are this this
 
01:29:40.510 --> 01:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh but remember that in the
 
01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
budget the Senate increased revenues
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
from this committee a lot more but they
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
based the budget on something a lot less
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of surplus in that
 
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
budget uh that they that we all both
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
party both House and Senate uh agreed to
 
01:29:58.199 --> 01:30:00.149 align:start position:0%
party both House and Senate uh agreed to
so

01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
um so here's my six points I got six
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
points real quick uh again my first one
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
I already mentioned for years people
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
thought there was
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
no uh income tax uh people were shocked
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
to find out that there was an interest
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax and we made the move
 
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
because we were in a fiscal position to
 
01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.709 align:start position:0%
because we were in a fiscal position to
do

01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
but people of financial means were
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
moving here most of those would know
 
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:29.560 align:start position:0%
that there that there was an interest in
 
01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.709 align:start position:0%
that there that there was an interest in
dividends

01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
dividends
 
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
tax uh but the fact that we're removing
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
that is now making them more willing and
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
spurring on them to move to New
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and guess what they spend
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
that money here the people of means will
 
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
be spending that money here uh which
 
01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
will eventually wind its way into
 
01:30:48.199 --> 01:30:49.109 align:start position:0%
will eventually wind its way into
business

01:30:49.109 --> 01:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.109 --> 01:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh and then then my next point is simple
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
one uh representa mami's point is that
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's a philosophical
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
difference she she feels that the upper
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
the upper income from inition dividends
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
people should pay more than the lower
 
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
rung uh of
 
01:31:20.629 --> 01:31:20.639 align:start position:0%
income uh but that's a philosophical
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
difference um I think I think that uh if
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to eliminate it let's
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate it let's not keep on even
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
though she feels the tax is
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional we're still going to
 
01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
have tears we're still at some point uh
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's not an equal it's not it will not
 
01:31:38.430 --> 01:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
be an equal
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
tax so uh the fourth point is
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh remember that businesses also play
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax and by
 
01:31:51.030 --> 01:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating the interest in dividends
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
tax yes the because they have
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
Investments so businesses also pay that
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
tax and uh they invest their money um
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
and by eliminating it to me it's just an
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
another component of creating a business
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
friendly environment in New Hampshire
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
and we did that by reducing the the uh
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
in a very rational way over many years
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
reducing business taxes here and uh and
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
and the proofs in the Ping by the big
 
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
jump that we've seen in interest in
 
01:32:29.229 --> 01:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
dividends now I know I saw the slon
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
article to and we talked about that in
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
the gr State taxpayer group and no one
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
in that group agrees with that article
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
nobody just just to make that point and
 
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
I know we know him I know him very well
 
01:32:43.470 --> 01:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
because he comes here every year and
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
testifies uh during budget
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
time so the the the fifth
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
point and I think
 
01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
represent Army Point pointed this out
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
that they there's you could say there's
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
a slight slowing in in revenues and
 
01:33:00.159 --> 01:33:01.470 align:start position:0%
a slight slowing in in revenues and
business

01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
taxes um it was that 9.6 million I think
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
yes it's for last month but business
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
taxes are still 36.8 million above
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
Target and again a very inflated
 
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
Target uh uh so I I would say uh it's
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
fine it's just one
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
month but and and then and she was
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
pointing out rightfully so and if you
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
read your Revenue Focus they describe
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
what happened in the first six months
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
because we we we had the credit carry
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
forward Bill uh that we dealt with a
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
couple years ago where we said because
 
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
the amount of credits that were out
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
there by
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
individuals was significant and if
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
everybody asked for a refund on one year
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have the money to do it it
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
so we are now forcing individuals I
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
think it's I forget the total it's it's
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
in the report it's 500 something
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
we that we're forcing them to to give
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
back some of to actually for us to give
 
01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
them back money we are refunding people
 
01:34:15.629 --> 01:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
at a higher rate because we're forcing
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
them to accept that we're not we're not
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
allowing them to keep that money uh as
 
01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
we were unlimited before more and that
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
that that's going to go down a little
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
bit more each
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
year so of the
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
89 this year so far TW first 12 12 uh
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
six months the refunds were $ 89.8
 
01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
million uh as compared to last fiscal
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
year at the same time of 45.2 million so
 
01:34:48.990 --> 01:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
those refunds have doubl so yes that
 
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
would have and a lot of that would
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
impact in December as people are getting
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh as the year as the calendar year was
 
01:34:59.070 --> 01:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
was ending uh but uh but so that's one
 
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the reasons why there's a slight
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.629 --> 01:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
taxes and then my final my final point
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
is most people celebrated the fact that
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
the interest in I I didn't meet one
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
person of even less of my means who who
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
didn't think that getting rid of the
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
intive attack the give in tax was a good
 
01:35:26.790 --> 01:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
idea uh and and again this is one of
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
those perception things by the public we
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
as a legislature said we were going to
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
do this the governor signed the bill we
 
01:35:35.550 --> 01:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
were phasing it out and now we're going
 
01:35:37.629 --> 01:35:37.639 align:start position:0%
to reverse that we're going to we're
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to put it back in starting next
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
year I know that the that the uh
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
exemptions are a lot higher and all of
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
that uh but I just still think it's a
 
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
bad look for us to reverse course on
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
this especially what the other revenues
 
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:51.910 align:start position:0%
this especially what the other revenues
still

01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
doing quite well so that's that's my
 
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and I I appreciate the time
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any question yes
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has a question
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I've heard other
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
people make the same comment that you
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
did that
 
01:36:17.350 --> 01:36:17.360 align:start position:0%
by eliminating this tax more very
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
wealthy people who get income from
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends will move to New
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right and I'm just wondering
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
if you have any proof of that
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
because my assumption if you know my
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
guess as to you know why somebody would
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
move to New Hampshire if they're very
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
wealthy and and didn't have any other
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
reason to pick New Hampshire over
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
something else that it would be because
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
they're trying to avoid just a general
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
income tax well yeah I mean let's look
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
at Massachusetts they put a millionaires
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
tax in place what happened they're
 
01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
fleeing they're losing tax revenue
 
01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:02.679 align:start position:0%
California who taxes everything
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
California people are fleeing California
 
01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
because they keep on increasing those
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
taxes and uh and and people are going to
 
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
go they're moving they're voting with
 
01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:13.750 align:start position:0%
go they're moving they're voting with
their

01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:37:16.189 --> 01:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
feet uh and we want to make it
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
attractive to them to come over here to
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
us um because
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know again these are all
 
01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
philosophical things I mean I I
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
personally believe that if you attract
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
and make this a good business climate
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
businesses will come we've proven that
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
they have come despite what Sutton has
 
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
they have come despite what Sutton has
to

01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
say um and I think individuals make
 
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
those same and it just happens that
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
people are more flexible to move when
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
they're retired because they don't have
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
to worry about where they make their
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
income but we'll take that money when
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
they come here they're gonna they're
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
going to spend that money here they're
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
gonna they're gonna they're going to
 
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
hire The Gardener they're going to hire
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
the whatever and uh uh you know and
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
everybody everybody gets good paying
 
01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
jobs I mean I I uh especially in
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
business when they when they come
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
because a lot of these businesses that
 
01:38:05.119 --> 01:38:05.830 align:start position:0%
because a lot of these businesses that
come

01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
here uh do create I mean we're talking
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
bigger businesses make good good
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
salaries and in terms of uh the fact is
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
that there's such a shortage of
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
workers we're seeing that without
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
without raising our minimum wage
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
we're I mean we're seeing we're seeing
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
people making a lot more money than ever
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
before at lower paying jobs I mean you
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
can make if you can't make $20 an hour
 
01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
now um there's something wrong with you
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
I mean they're they're everywhere I mean
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
I uh you you uh but anyway I I don't
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.550 --> 01:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
thing yes representative shamber thank
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
my Qui question The Honorable
 
01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:55.639 align:start position:0%
Representative Patrick
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
aramy uh you mentioned that you said
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
remember businesses pay interest in

mean the interest in
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
dividends that they obviously they pay
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
shareholders that's a different kind of
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
Interest dividends which is good because
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
those investors have reinvest that money
 
01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
and they buy things so that's a positive
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
thing but the interest in dividends that
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
they make no it's there but they you
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
know what they do with that they they
 
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
they you have you have profits you keep
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
some in the bank what do you spend that
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
money on eventually
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
you on increased you you you're going to
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
build a new building you're going to
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
build a new plant that's what it goes to
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
and that all creates new jobs therefore
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
more wealth for the state as well as the
 
01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
country so it's it's it's basic
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
economics I mean
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh I'll leave it at that one last
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%

01:41:18.030 --> 01:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
to have a philosophical issue which we
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
can have again in the work session you
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of people moving from
 
01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:27.639 align:start position:0%
certain States uh because of taxes uh do
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
you sure they're not moving here because
 
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280 align:start position:0%

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
our clean air our land over the economic
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%

have known for many many
 
01:47:15.790 --> 01:47:15.800 align:start position:0%
decades the tax proposed in this bill
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
like the current law is based on the
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
resulting earnings not on the asset
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
itself so let me do a little math for a
 
01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:26.679 align:start position:0%
comparison for
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
you under this bill for a couple today
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
with a million dollars of Investments
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
and perhaps earning
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
5% the interest in dividends tax would
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
be 50 the interest in dividends earn
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
would be $50,000 of which
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
15,000 would be exempt for the couple
 
01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
and the 5% tax on the remaining
 
01:47:56.149 --> 01:47:56.159 align:start position:0%
$35,000 of earned interest in dividends
 
01:47:58.629 --> 01:47:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
$1,750 that's what this bill would
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
produce under those conditions if the
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
original 1784 law were in effect with
 
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
its rate of 1 half% of the assets
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
$5,000 about three times as much as this
 
01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
bill would propose
 
01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
I just want you to reflect on that as
 
01:48:27.589 --> 01:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
you consider House Bill
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
1492 that tax on assets has a long
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
history in this
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
state and I know that there are
 
01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
certainly people who would like to Red
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes and I imagine as each of
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
you ran for office you had quite a few
 
01:48:48.270 --> 01:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with your constituents
 
01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:49.189 align:start position:0%
conversations with your constituents
about

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
taxes but I would also bet that the tax
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
they were most concerned about was the
 
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
property tax not the interest in
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
dividends tax so I have a suggestion for
 
01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
you in this bill Dr is to deposit the
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
proceeds I suggest it be amended to have
 
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
those proceeds be deposited in the
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to do that would
 
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
result in an equal amount of property
 
01:49:20.910 --> 01:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
tax reduction throughout the state
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
so instead of reducing the interest in
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
dividends tax put it back to the 5% put
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
it all in the education trust fund just
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
like the car rental tax is and you'll be
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
providing property tax relief of about
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
$100 million a year thank you thank you
 
01:49:39.119 --> 01:49:41.589 align:start position:0%
$100 million a year thank you thank you
any

01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent ORS thank you Mr
 
01:49:48.910 --> 01:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
chair and welcome honorable Doug Hall
 
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you here
 
01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
so you had mentioned the uh the tax the
 
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
current uh the way you work this formula
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
out saying that the insuring dividends
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
would be 50,000 which 15,000 would be
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
exempt is that something written into
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
the current tax code I assume no that's
 
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill okay it's in the
 
01:50:13.430 --> 01:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
bill all right thank you very
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
much

01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.950 --> 01:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
kleene hi Mr chairman members of the
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having me I'm
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
Drew Klein and president of the jiah
 
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
barlot Center for Public Policy we're
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's free market Think Tank
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
um our view on this bill starts with the
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
fact that New Hampshire has uh had an
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
income tax now for a long time that's
 
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
the interest dividends tax and it is in
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
fact an income tax it is um written in
 
01:50:59.149 --> 01:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
the state law as an income tax that's
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
the actual language used in the state
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
law uh the Department of Revenue
 
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
Administration calls it an income tax
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
and hp1 1492 calls it an income tax so
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does in fact have an
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
income tax it's on passive income earned
 
01:51:13.069 --> 01:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
through interest
 
01:51:15.589 --> 01:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
dividends and that expires at the end of
 
01:51:18.669 --> 01:51:18.679 align:start position:0%
this year which will make when that
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
happens New Hampshire the only state in
 
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
the Northeast without an income
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
tax it would make New Hampshire to my
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge the eighth State without an
 
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
income tax some people say seventh I
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
think it's eighth um we would be the
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
Northeast United States is the only
 
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
region of the five regions in the
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
country that does not have a single
 
01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
state without an income tax so if you go
 
01:51:48.350 --> 01:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
to the southeast the Southwest the
 
01:51:51.149 --> 01:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
Midwest West the the Northwest they all
 
01:51:54.669 --> 01:51:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
tax the closest state with no income tax
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire is Tennessee which just
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
got rid of its version of the interest
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
and dividend tax a couple years
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
ago what we've seen in the
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
last several years is a um rapidly
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
increased increasing level of
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
competition among the states for people
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
and for business businesses for
 
01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
investment for
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship um just from if I get
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
the numbers right off the top of my head
 
01:52:30.189 --> 01:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
um and I can go back and look this up
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
for you but I believe it was you know 21
 
01:52:32.719 --> 01:52:33.589 align:start position:0%
for you but I believe it was you know 21
through

01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
22 going into um the first part of 2023
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
just look at that you know roughly two
 
01:52:44.109 --> 01:52:44.119 align:start position:0%
years there uh 22 States cut taxes um
 
01:52:46.750 --> 01:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
only a couple have increased taxes and
 
01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
they're doing this because they're
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
competing very aggressively for
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
residents and all we have to do is look
 
01:52:54.350 --> 01:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
at Massachusetts to see how much it
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
means to tax or not tax higher income
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
residents it's Pioneer Institute which
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
is sort of our counterpart down there
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's the think tank in
 
01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:07.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they looked at out
 
01:53:10.069 --> 01:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
migration from Massachusetts and it's
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
really rather stunning before the
 
01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
millionaires tax happened from 2019 to
 
01:53:18.430 --> 01:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
2021 the top four states are net out
 
01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
migration of wealth and we're looking
 
01:53:24.270 --> 01:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
at the total amount of wealth that
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
leaves the state when people leave we're
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
California New York Illinois and
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in 2019 net out migration
 
01:53:33.390 --> 01:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
of adjusted gross income from
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was just over 900 million
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
but by 2021 it was 4.3
 
01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
billion that is high net worth higher
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
income individuals fleeing Massachusetts
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
that was before the millionaires tax
 
01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
that was put in place in 2022 2 took
 
01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
effect in 2023 and you saw um an
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
immediate spike in high income High net
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%

01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
moving to Florida partly because of the
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
weather and partly because it does not
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
have a tax on unearned income they have
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
no income tax in Florida they have a
 
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
sales tax but they do not have a tax on
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
interest dividend
 
01:55:18.599 --> 01:55:20.629 align:start position:0%
interest dividend
income

01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
when you see that people fleeing
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts pick as their top two
 
01:55:27.390 --> 01:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
destinations Florida and New Hampshire
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
not Connecticut in New Hampshire not
 
01:55:31.229 --> 01:55:31.239 align:start position:0%
Maine in New Hampshire not Vermont in
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that tells you something
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
very important they the only state in
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
the Northeast without any income tax
 
01:55:41.629 --> 01:55:41.639 align:start position:0%
that will be a powerful recruiting tool
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
marketing tool Economic Development
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
tool um but that will not happen if we
 
01:55:48.589 --> 01:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
reinstate the income tax in New
 
01:55:48.599 --> 01:55:50.310 align:start position:0%
reinstate the income tax in New
Hampshire

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
so from our point of view at the ji
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
Bartlet Center we work on economic
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
growth issues we work on uh State
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
competitiveness issues and we talked to
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of think tanks around the country
 
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
and we can see this movement happening
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
you see it in Census Data you see it in
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
Moving company data or people tend to
 
01:56:08.069 --> 01:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
move um there are factors not everybody
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
makes the decision purely on financial
 
01:56:12.030 --> 01:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
reasons but when you hold all other
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
factors um into account and you account
 
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
for weather and you account for job
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
opportunities Etc um low taxes is a
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
serious um and Powerful motivating
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
factor for where people migrate from and
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
so this bill would make New Hampshire
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
much less competitive and much less
 
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
attractive to people who would look to
 
01:56:36.629 --> 01:56:36.639 align:start position:0%
move in here but it also would continue
 
01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
pushing people out of New Hampshire and
 
01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's something that we it's not just
 
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
that we would attract people to move in
 
01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:44.719 align:start position:0%
we do now have people leaving the state
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
because of this tax so from our point of
 
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
view that would be a negative um overall
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
effect on this on the
 
01:56:56.589 --> 01:56:56.599 align:start position:0%
state thank you yes
 
01:56:58.990 --> 01:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
YY thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:57:03.629 --> 01:57:03.639 align:start position:0%
taking uh my question Mr sure um a
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
couple of questions the first
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
one would you say or would you agree
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
that the middle class in the United
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
States under under the current economic
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
situation is running between $200 and
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
$300,000 per year for married couple I
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
would really hate to define those terms
 
01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
um I think that's dependent on a lot of
 
01:57:30.589 --> 01:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
your own personal and family situation
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
of whether you view yourself middle
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
class or not um so I I would hate to say
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
but I think it's fair to say that um
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
most people who earn in that range would
 
01:57:43.830 --> 01:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
consider themselves middle class and not
 
01:57:50.069 --> 01:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
wealthy and follow up follow up so as we
 
01:57:52.109 --> 01:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
in reading this particular bill it
 
01:57:53.790 --> 01:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
appears as
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
though the base of the um or the the
 
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
body of those eligible for taxation
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
would be expanded even though there was
 
01:58:08.709 --> 01:58:08.719 align:start position:0%
there are increases in um exemptions and
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
deductions and you know a bunch
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
of ply stuff messing around with it but
 
01:58:18.669 --> 01:58:18.679 align:start position:0%
it would seem as though the the body
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
would be EXP exped well into the middle
 
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
class which would then to
 
01:58:30.430 --> 01:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
me seem to be attacking and retarding
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
the growth of upward mobility of
 
01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
individuals is that a fair analysis in
 
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
your opinion well I mean I don't know
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
that i' get
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
into sort of trying to Define with
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
Precision who would pay this tax under
 
01:58:47.629 --> 01:58:47.639 align:start position:0%
here I think it's a little complicated
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
um maybe the Dr can have a little bit
 
01:58:51.470 --> 01:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
bit more of a say on that but as I look
 
01:58:54.629 --> 01:58:54.639 align:start position:0%
at it um and looking at the interest and
 
01:58:57.870 --> 01:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
dividends income tax right now um it is
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
simply not true that uh the the sort of
 
01:59:04.149 --> 01:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
perception of this is a tax that only
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
the super wealthy pay I mean when you
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
look now at who pays the interest and
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
dividends tax I mean when you look at
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
the dr's own numbers um you know 41% of
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
those who pay the interest dividends tax
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
only pay between $100 and
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
$500 in the tax that's after the
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
deduction now the deduction increase in
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
The Spill will shift that burden more
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
towards uh higher income individuals but
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
it is just not the case now and it
 
01:59:31.870 --> 01:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the case in the future that
 
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
this would only affect you know super
 
01:59:37.629 --> 01:59:37.639 align:start position:0%
wealthy people uh folks who have put
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
away a sizable amount of money and H to
 
01:59:43.109 --> 01:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
grow that investment income would be hit
 
01:59:45.870 --> 01:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
by this tax and the the other thing to
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
sort of keep in mind is that when you
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
have an income tax on the book even if
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
if you create those exemptions and carve
 
01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
outs and you try to skew it to the super
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
wealthy the fact is you still have an
 
02:00:00.589 --> 02:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
income tax on the books and when you are
 
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
talking about attracting people look
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
more and more people
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
now are trying to make their money
 
02:00:10.030 --> 02:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
through Investments um people are
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
getting a lot more Savvy about how to
 
02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
make passive income that this is a path
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
to a secure future um so it is
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
detrimental to New Hampshire in the long
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
term in terms of attracting people from
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
outside but also keeping people here who
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
want to build up that nest egg over time
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
you don't normally just all of a sudden
 
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
have a million dollars in the bank you
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
grow that over time you start small and
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
grow at large and so when you're looking
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
at a state that has an income tax on
 
02:00:42.990 --> 02:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
that investment
 
02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
income versus a state that
 
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't you're going to start to weigh
 
02:00:51.390 --> 02:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
those calculations and you know I I
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
respect Doug Hall very much
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
um in
 
02:01:00.270 --> 02:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
1784 most people never ventured more
 
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
than 20 miles from their home we live in
 
02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
a much different competitive economic
 
02:01:06.430 --> 02:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
world that we do today people can
 
02:01:08.069 --> 02:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
literally choose to live anywhere in the
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
world they want and New Hampshire needs
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's attractive to families
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
that want to build wealth um and having
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
an income tax on the books is going to
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
make us somewhat less attractive to
 
02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:21.830 align:start position:0%
make us somewhat less attractive to
those

02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:01:25.069 --> 02:01:25.079 align:start position:0%

02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
schwier and you can let me know how
 
02:02:10.750 --> 02:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
close I came with pronouncing your name
 
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you Mr chairman members
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee I am Roy schwier that
 
02:02:16.189 --> 02:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
is the correct pronunciation according
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
to the German language and I'm from
 
02:02:21.270 --> 02:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
conquer and I'd like to say I think this
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
proposed tax is kind of like about the
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
most unfair tax you could devise and I
 
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
have three reasons for that number one
 
02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
is if somebody has a pencil they can
 
02:02:32.109 --> 02:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
write down this question for me when the
 
02:02:34.109 --> 02:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
Dr comes up what percentage of the
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax is paid by
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
people over 65 they know that because
 
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
the check box on the form is compared to
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the total income in
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
the state is earned by people over 65 I
 
02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:48.719 align:start position:0%
think you'll find that this tax is you
 
02:02:48.719 --> 02:02:50.310 align:start position:0%
think you'll find that this tax is you
know

02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
far heavier on retired people and that's
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
particularly interesting because if
 
02:02:56.589 --> 02:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about putting that the in
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund retired people
 
02:03:00.669 --> 02:03:00.679 align:start position:0%
are probably far less than people in
 
02:03:04.109 --> 02:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
other age groups to have kids in schools
 
02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
and as far as what representative Aly
 
02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
said about it being unconstitutional not
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
to have this tax I'm going to ask why is
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
it unconstitutional to not tax interest
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
in dividends but it's okay to not
 
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
tax earned income
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
wages and if you think this tax is to
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
soak the rich instead of you know going
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
after people interest in dividends why
 
02:03:27.629 --> 02:03:27.639 align:start position:0%
not have an income tax on everybody with
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
$100,000 a year exemption I mean that
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
way you'd really get people with money
 
02:03:35.069 --> 02:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't be you know going after
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
people that may or may not be making
 
02:03:39.310 --> 02:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
good money like right now if I have
 
02:03:42.189 --> 02:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
$8,000 in interest and dividend income I
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
would have to pay this tax if I have
 
02:03:46.270 --> 02:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
$100,000 salary I have to pay nothing
 
02:03:49.149 --> 02:03:49.159 align:start position:0%
and that is you know fair for our share
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
of the state expenses the second thing
 
02:03:53.950 --> 02:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
has to do with what we'll call inflation
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
that's been very low for a long time and
 
02:03:58.270 --> 02:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
people haven't thought about it but it
 
02:04:01.390 --> 02:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
really eats up over the years on people
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
I think I figured out one time that I
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
the money I have now was worth 17th of
 
02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
what it was when I first started earning
 
02:04:12.270 --> 02:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
and I've always felt it was really nasty
 
02:04:13.709 --> 02:04:13.719 align:start position:0%
the federal government I mean they're
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
the ones that could stop inflation they
 
02:04:17.229 --> 02:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
allow inflation to exist and then when
 
02:04:19.149 --> 02:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
there's inflation they tax you more the
 
02:04:20.830 --> 02:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
more inflation there is based on the
 
02:04:22.709 --> 02:04:22.719 align:start position:0%
income tax on your interest I don't
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
think there's anybody in this state that
 
02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
has Bank interest that pays even as much
 
02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
as the inflation rate I think unless you
 
02:04:32.109 --> 02:04:32.119 align:start position:0%
you know earn a credit card company or
 
02:04:34.030 --> 02:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
or a loone shark the interest you earn
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
is less than the inflation so in fact
 
02:04:38.549 --> 02:04:38.559 align:start position:0%
you're kicking people when they're down
 
02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
if you're charging a tax on Bank
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
interest because I in effect have less
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing power at the end of the year
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
and the state is still taxing me on the
 
02:04:48.109 --> 02:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
fact I'm getting less purchasing power
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
and my last
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
item has to do with the the people who
 
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
are even older when I started working in
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
1972 full-time you the IAS didn't exist
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
401ks didn't exist 401ks didn't be
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
become popular until 1981 which is nine
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
years after I started working so when I
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
had to start putting money aside the
 
02:05:12.030 --> 02:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
only thing I could do is put it in
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
regular you know bank accounts and
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
stocks and so forth so in
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
effect if someone put puts their money
 
02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
in a
 
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
401k they don't get taxed when they take
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
it out by the state but because I put my
 
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
money in a savings account or a stock I
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
wind up having to pay tax on the income
 
02:05:34.589 --> 02:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
from that whereas I wouldn't have had to
 
02:05:37.990 --> 02:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
pay tax on the income from the 401K so
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
particularly older folks and some of you
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
may be among
 
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
them you know you have years when you're
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
putting money away and you couldn't you
 
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
know get a tax exemption of and I'm
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
still pay paying the interest on it so I
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
think that uh you know thinking about
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
not just people over 65 but people over
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know whatever since 1981 people that
 
02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:00.679 align:start position:0%
you know became a wage earners before
 
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
then need to have some special deal for
 
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that they're getting taxed on
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
their retirement money whereas younger
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
people that have a 401k aren't and the
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
last thing I'm going to mention is I
 
02:06:14.750 --> 02:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
haven't got all my statements this year
 
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
for interest I've earned and two weeks
 
02:06:19.549 --> 02:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
ago I went to the
 
02:06:21.950 --> 02:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue Administration to get tax
 
02:06:23.549 --> 02:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
warrants for this year oh we don't have
 
02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
those yet you can get them off the
 
02:06:26.189 --> 02:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
internet well if I don't have internet
 
02:06:27.870 --> 02:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
at home that makes it hard to get forms
 
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
off the internet I should be able to get
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
them when I go to the Dr so you might
 
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
ask them why tax warrants for this year
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
weren't available December 1st so I
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
could take my tax forms and take my
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
interest statements and figure out
 
02:06:41.069 --> 02:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
whether I should pay estimated tax or
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
not because my concern is the interest
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm getting this year is a lot higher
 
02:06:46.950 --> 02:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
percentage than it was two or three
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
years ago I'm asked have to be paid
 
02:06:50.549 --> 02:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
paying more interest dividends tax than
 
02:06:53.229 --> 02:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
I was previously even though it's all
 
02:06:55.270 --> 02:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
phony money I'm losing money on that and
 
02:06:58.549 --> 02:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
I'm still paying a lot of tax on it so
 
02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
sir okay and last uh lastly I'll ask
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%

there were any questions before we had

you have to walk up but does does anyone
 
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:50.360 align:start position:0%

questions thank you for coming back up I
 
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
you I don't have any more pink cards is
 
02:08:01.069 --> 02:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who would like to
 
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 1492 before I close the
 
02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:05.750 align:start position:0%
testify on HB 1492 before I close the
public

02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:08:07.990 --> 02:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
hearing seeing none I will close the
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:21.669 align:start position:0%
 
1492

02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.030 --> 02:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
now we do have three more bills um and
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
um I know last time we skipped lunch and
 
02:08:32.109 --> 02:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
we didn't finish till about quarter a
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
three however these three bills may go
 
02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
quickly I'm thinking what we will do is
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
we'll start with the first one we'll
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
kind of see how it goes and if it takes
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
longer than expected we'll take a lunch
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
break um I my my thought is right now
 
02:08:49.069 --> 02:08:49.079 align:start position:0%
that these three are
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
very related and and very fairly very
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
straightforward so we may be able to get
 
02:09:02.430 --> 02:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
see okay I will open the hearing on hb1
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
1531 and recognize representative ulery
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
to introduce the
 
02:09:14.189 --> 02:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair my name is
 
02:09:18.549 --> 02:09:18.559 align:start position:0%
Jordan oler Hillsboro 13 town of Hudson
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm introducing HB
 
02:09:25.229 --> 02:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
1531 relative to allowing business
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
profits tax adjustment for the
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
depreciation deduction permitted under
 
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
the uh Internal Revenue code section 168
 
02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:38.510 align:start position:0%
the uh Internal Revenue code section 168
paragraph

02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.030 --> 02:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
K all this does is bring allows uh New
 
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses to take advantage
 
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
of existing federal law I believe this
 
02:09:50.589 --> 02:09:50.599 align:start position:0%
was recommended by d uh to some degree
 
02:09:53.790 --> 02:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
to allow some compatibility between the
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh two different tax structures and make
 
02:09:58.510 --> 02:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
their job easier and make it easier for
 
02:10:01.790 --> 02:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
businesses in New
 
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay I think on this one we
 
02:10:06.549 --> 02:10:06.559 align:start position:0%
probably will end up having them uh give
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
us more detail does anyone have any
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
questions of Representative illery good
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
no okay he's relieved thank
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
you all right um
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
I don't have any other pink cards um is
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wants to testify
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
1531

02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
um to work session Dr No I'm going to
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:56.629 align:start position:0%
 
time

02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:58.390 --> 02:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Kong tax policy council
 
02:10:59.390 --> 02:10:59.400 align:start position:0%

02:11:04.639 --> 02:11:09.510 align:start position:0%
analyst
Dr

02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Aly thank you
 
02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
questions representative Aly thank you
could

02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
you explain on I think what this says is
 
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to give a greater
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
upfront deduction for new property than
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
do uh that is correct so um essentially
 
02:11:37.830 --> 02:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
this 168k is a like a a bonus
 
02:11:42.189 --> 02:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
depreciation um and it essentially
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
accelerates those depreciation deduction
 
02:11:48.430 --> 02:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
for certain qualified assets uh at the
 
02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
uh in the year where the property was
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
placed into service and then once that's
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
done the the remainder of the uh the uh
 
02:11:59.790 --> 02:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
depreciation allowable depreciation will
 
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
be claimed over the useful life of the
 
02:12:04.990 --> 02:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
asset so essentially instead of um let
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
say an asset has a 20-year useful life
 
02:12:10.790 --> 02:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
which is normally claimed over the 20
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
years uh this provision allows initial
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
part of the uh the claim to be made in
 
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
the first year whereas um the
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
the that's how it normally works but
 
02:12:26.589 --> 02:12:26.599 align:start position:0%
then with the with the
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
tcja the 100% of the um expense or 100%
 
02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
of the cost actually allowed on the
 
02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:34.549 align:start position:0%
of the cost actually allowed on the
first

02:12:34.549 --> 02:12:34.559 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
starting starting 2023 onwards that um
 
02:12:49.709 --> 02:12:49.719 align:start position:0%
that 100% reduces to to 80% and then 60%
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth until 2027 it
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
becomes zero um this bill um removes all
 
02:13:02.430 --> 02:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
100% essentially there is a there is a
 
02:13:07.709 --> 02:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
limit it's 100% but there is a limit
 
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
correct it's up to
 
02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:10.570 align:start position:0%
correct it's up to
500,000

02:13:10.570 --> 02:13:10.580 align:start position:0%
500,000
 
02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:12.069 align:start position:0%
500,000
[Music]

02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
um because I know on H um another bill
 
02:13:18.510 --> 02:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
will'll be talking about HB 1536
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
yeah deals with the limit yeah that one
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
is the uh the 179 deduction so that one
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
has that limit this one is the 168k um
 
02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
bonus depreciation uh it does not have
 
02:13:32.990 --> 02:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
that limit um so essentially it's a
 
02:13:35.709 --> 02:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
timing if everything else remains equal
 
02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
is essentially a timing difference um
 
02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
likely where uh a business organization
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
is able to claim upfront the first year
 
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
that they plac the uh asset into service
 
02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
100% of the expense versus cling over
 
02:13:53.910 --> 02:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
the 20 years or whatever useful life of
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
the asset but is there a limit on on
 
02:13:59.109 --> 02:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
that number uh no I don't believe
 
02:14:01.709 --> 02:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
there's a limit for this one the the 179
 
02:14:03.669 --> 02:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
there was there's a limit on the 179
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
expense it's also a a first year
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
deduction on the expense okay yes
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
represent thank you follow up and were
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
we doing this
 
02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
before um
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
no uh we the current law is that we do
 
02:14:27.629 --> 02:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:27.639 --> 02:14:29.149 align:start position:0%
 
depreciation

02:14:29.149 --> 02:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
depreciation
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
so follow up follow up so if
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
the on company which builds industrial
 
02:14:44.109 --> 02:14:44.119 align:start position:0%
wire in um I can never remember it's not
 
02:14:48.109 --> 02:14:48.119 align:start position:0%
in Bristol it's it's closer to it in
 
02:14:52.549 --> 02:14:52.559 align:start position:0%
Grafton County on which is a very large
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
company on decides to totally replace a
 
02:14:57.360 --> 02:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
company on decides to totally replace a
$50

02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
million uh cyclotron or
 
02:15:06.189 --> 02:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
something uh that it's
 
02:15:06.199 --> 02:15:08.229 align:start position:0%
something uh that it's
using

02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
using
 
02:15:11.350 --> 02:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
um and its
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
tax rate its tax goes down to Zero
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
year but then would
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
we if it was only 2 million that year
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
and they had 50 million I'm just picking
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
on them because I'm really impressed by
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
them on and it goes down to to two
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
million uh they only can take two
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
million but of the 50 million do they
 
02:15:52.149 --> 02:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
keep then taking it off every year until
 
02:15:54.270 --> 02:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
the 50 million is
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
exhausted so if that uh that business
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
organization had that qualifying asset
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
um and if only 2 million of that
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
qualifying asset uh sorry has qualifying
 
02:16:07.510 --> 02:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
assets and only 2 million of those
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
assets are qualifying assets for the uh
 
02:16:11.669 --> 02:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
for this deduction yes then they would
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
um take that deduction in the year that
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
they would place in service and then the
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
the other assets that were not
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
qualifying assets they would be um
 
02:16:24.189 --> 02:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
depreciated over the useful life of the
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
asset so I'm sorry uh I guess I'm just
 
02:16:32.110 --> 02:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
really tired but on I I'm not sure he
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
understood the question okay it sounds
 
02:16:36.509 --> 02:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
to me what she's saying is if the
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
business only had a certain amount you
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
know they can only take a certain amount
 
02:16:41.469 --> 02:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
because their income is only a certain
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
level and they have to continue that
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
depreciation in another year is it
 
02:16:45.639 --> 02:16:46.669 align:start position:0%
depreciation in another year is it
allowed

02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
02:16:46.679 --> 02:16:48.429 align:start position:0%
allowed
to

02:16:48.429 --> 02:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
oh um forget the or is it only a onee
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
thing uh if I'm not mistaken um but I
 
02:16:58.589 --> 02:16:58.599 align:start position:0%
just need to double check this but not
 
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
mistaken there there uh there's no
 
02:17:03.389 --> 02:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
income sort of a limitation to that so
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
even though if if the uh the business
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
organization um has that only a certain
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
amount of taxable income the
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
depreciation that would be able to be
 
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
claimed under the 168k will be whatever
 
02:17:18.910 --> 02:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
that's fully allowed in that one year um
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
and it potentially could generate a net
 
02:17:23.870 --> 02:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
operating loss situation and then carry
 
02:17:27.309 --> 02:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
over the net operating loss over
 
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
oh and that one is kept at 10 yes that's
 
02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
right million yeah so the most we'd lose
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
million y um actually uh representative
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
shamberg um I think I I got Clarity on
 
02:17:50.509 --> 02:17:50.519 align:start position:0%
on the whole idea of testifying being on
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
a bill and asking questions and the
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
choice is you either testify on the bill
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
or you can ask questions so if you're
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
sitting back there because you think you
 
02:18:05.709 --> 02:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
you you can
 
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
actually but you can sit here you can
 
02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:10.349 align:start position:0%
actually but you can sit here you can
sit

02:18:10.349 --> 02:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
sit
 
02:18:12.910 --> 02:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
here that's
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
fine okay I just because that was
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
something that that needed clarification
 
02:18:17.280 --> 02:18:18.230 align:start position:0%
something that that needed clarification
from

02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:18:20.750 --> 02:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
from last week um I told representative
 
02:18:23.389 --> 02:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
ORS that he couldn't ask questions um it
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
turns out after checking with the clerk
 
02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
he can because even if you're a
 
02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor you have a choice you're
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
either testifying or you can stay back
 
02:18:33.870 --> 02:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
um at your seat and ask questions you
 
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
can't do both um so representative PL
 
02:18:41.549 --> 02:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
yes would you please explain to me the
 
02:18:43.709 --> 02:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
appreciation under Section 168 of the
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code is that
 
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
depreciation of any asset you place in
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.910 --> 02:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
assets so the uh the bonus depreciation
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
only applies to depreciation uh
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
depreciable assets with a recovery per
 
02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
period of 20 years or
 
02:19:09.469 --> 02:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
less um so essentially it would be
 
02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
Vehicles furniture manufacturing
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
equipment heavy machinery uh but not
 
02:19:16.439 --> 02:19:26.589 align:start position:0%
equipment heavy machinery uh but not
buildings

02:19:26.589 --> 02:19:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it's representing
 
02:19:31.950 --> 02:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
fellows so that that is also my question
 
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
like what are the things the qualifying
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
things so you know you just said is it
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
like any piece of equipment any vehicle
 
02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
I I mean there are a lot of you know I
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
know the dep normal
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know the tax law but I
 
02:19:52.309 --> 02:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
know I have an idea about like just
 
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
regular Accounting in different you know
 
02:19:57.790 --> 02:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
you depreciate a computer over maybe
 
02:19:59.870 --> 02:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
three years and a vehicle over maybe
 
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
three years but some other pieces of
 
02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
equipment would be
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
longer so is there something special
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
about this these
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
qualifying um assets compared to just
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
normal accounting so I I believe um the
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
purpose behind the um this 168k
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
originally from from the federal side of
 
02:20:26.990 --> 02:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
things is to
 
02:20:31.630 --> 02:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
stimulate um growth and therefore they I
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
speculate that that's the reason why
 
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
they would um have this qualifying
 
02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
assets up to the uh 20 years useful life
 
02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:41.790 align:start position:0%
assets up to the uh 20 years useful life
um

02:20:41.790 --> 02:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:44.590 --> 02:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so it is a something from the
 
02:20:45.950 --> 02:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
federal side it's not something that
 
02:20:52.270 --> 02:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:57.550 --> 02:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
Dr so that that was um put in during the
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
tcja and that is phasing out correct
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
that is correct yep and so this would
 
02:21:07.469 --> 02:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
this would allow New Hampshire to be um
 
02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
favorable to business investment and
 
02:21:12.910 --> 02:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
potentially attract uh more business
 
02:21:15.270 --> 02:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
here the uh the the the the bonus
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
depreciation essentially actually it was
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
enacted prior to tcj but then it has a
 
02:21:24.110 --> 02:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
like a I think 50% depreciation uh
 
02:21:27.870 --> 02:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
deduction allowable during tcja um the
 
02:21:30.190 --> 02:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
federal government increased that to
 
02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
100% with the uh with the phase outs
 
02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
over the number of
 
02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
years um do we have any knowledge on um
 
02:21:40.389 --> 02:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
surrounding states and how they're
 
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
handling this whether they're allowing
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
this or there's some limit to it um my
 
02:21:49.070 --> 02:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
apologies no I not looked to that yeah
 
02:21:52.349 --> 02:21:52.359 align:start position:0%
okay is that something we could get
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
information on or yeah we'll try to uh
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
we can try to research that and see if
 
02:21:57.630 --> 02:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
we can come up with some information on
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you I think that would
 
02:22:00.750 --> 02:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
be that would be helpful to know yes
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so I mean maybe
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
you could um it would be helpful if I
 
02:22:08.349 --> 02:22:08.359 align:start position:0%
had something to read about what
 
02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
happened at the federal level that
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
created this you know program or I don't
 
02:22:16.830 --> 02:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
know what to call it you know that and
 
02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
why they did that were they trying to
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
like stimulate the economy and and is is
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
it staying on the federal books or is
 
02:22:30.349 --> 02:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
that coming off the federal books it's
 
02:22:35.590 --> 02:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
coming off in 2027 at 0% 20127 yes and
 
02:22:39.150 --> 02:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
then what if we pass this bill I'm sorry
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
followup okay followup follow so and so
 
02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill then would it would
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
it we be giving taking that off the book
 
02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
in 2027
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
100% thank you I I would just like if
 
02:23:03.429 --> 02:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
you can give me like a little one page
 
02:23:05.150 --> 02:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
description of the federal program that
 
02:23:15.309 --> 02:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
you yes represent BR thank you Mr
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and just so I understand this I
 
02:23:23.389 --> 02:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
think I heard this from the co-sponsor
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill so I can fully
 
02:23:29.230 --> 02:23:29.240 align:start position:0%
understand and I think I do but if I'm
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
hearing this correctly this will allow
 
02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:32.469 align:start position:0%
hearing this correctly this will allow
New

02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses uh to ultimately
 
02:23:37.990 --> 02:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
get into like a cost segregation study
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
where we can depreciate different assets
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
of an
 
02:23:45.630 --> 02:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
overall project at a different rate so
 
02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
that you know the building might might
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
be depreciated at 392 years but by with
 
02:23:52.429 --> 02:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
this bill we could depreciate the air
 
02:23:55.150 --> 02:23:55.160 align:start position:0%
conditioning system at 15 years the roof
 
02:23:57.870 --> 02:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
at 20 years is that is I understanding
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
that properly that this actually will
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
allow businesses in New Hampshire to do
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
what they're doing federally to do it on
 
02:24:06.030 --> 02:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
a state
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
level uh I believe that is correct
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
because on the on the federal side um I
 
02:24:13.469 --> 02:24:13.479 align:start position:0%
think business organizations are
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
encouraged to perform a cost segregation
 
02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
analysis so so that they can uh
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
substantiate what asset is a qualifying
 
02:24:23.269 --> 02:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
asset versus what asset is not a
 
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
qualifying asset for the IRS to allow
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the deduction um
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up follow up yes thank you
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
Mr J and then just as far as the federal
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
law that you talk about 2
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
2027 isn't do don't they gener the feds
 
02:24:41.550 --> 02:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
generally extend that law every every
 
02:24:43.269 --> 02:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
time you I mean that's usually the drama
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
that leads up to uh taxes and whether or
 
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
not they're going to extend that is that
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
am am I right in
 
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
that uh I I can't I can't speculate on
 
02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
on that on what the federal government
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
is going to do um it's it's 20 right now
 
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
0% yes represent
 
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
um what what percentage did we allow
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
before the TG well we haven't done we we
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
haven't gone with the TG
 
02:25:32.269 --> 02:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
G that law uh on so what percentage are
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
we currently allowing them to deduct at
 
02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:37.269 align:start position:0%
we currently allowing them to deduct at
the

02:25:37.269 --> 02:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:40.510 --> 02:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
beginning we currently do not allow um
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
the the bonus
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
depreciation oh at all at all yes so you
 
02:25:47.389 --> 02:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
just deduct
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
a percentage each year for the yes so
 
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
whatever uh whatever bonus depreciation
 
02:25:55.870 --> 02:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
that the business has taken federally it
 
02:25:57.830 --> 02:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
would be added back on the New Hampshire
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
side and then they the the business
 
02:26:02.790 --> 02:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
organization would depreciate that
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
regularly yeah well excuse follow up y
 
02:26:10.429 --> 02:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
follow up could uh could you give
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
us what businesses are permitted under
 
02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:19.630 align:start position:0%
us what businesses are permitted under
168k

02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:21.950 --> 02:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
because if we're allowing all businesses
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
this and they all started doing it in
 
02:26:32.429 --> 02:26:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
trouble I might be mistaken but I
 
02:26:37.110 --> 02:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
believe it's all businesses um there
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
might be an exception but then the
 
02:26:42.150 --> 02:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
essential driver is the um the asset
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
with the uh 20-year useful
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
life asset with a 20year useful yes and
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
I believe there there is some um
 
02:26:53.269 --> 02:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
probably some Industries are not
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
included in that um I just need to
 
02:26:56.429 --> 02:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
double check
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
that I I think we do need a better
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of exactly the impact um I
 
02:27:03.309 --> 02:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
I think I may have been mistaken that
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
there was a limit um tied but you know
 
02:27:11.630 --> 02:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
the section um 172 yeah but but you're
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
that's a different depreciation yeah
 
02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
that's the 179 uh expense deduction um
 
02:27:18.030 --> 02:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
and that that's another bill and
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
currently there is a limitation in terms
 
02:27:22.349 --> 02:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
of the maximum amount that can be
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
deducted that well that bill is mainly
 
02:27:26.190 --> 02:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
just talking about the LI the maximum
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
limitation um this bill we probably do
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
need a better understand exactly you
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
know for our work session on this
 
02:27:33.439 --> 02:27:35.110 align:start position:0%
know for our work session on this
exactly

02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
what is affected so that we can
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
understand the extent of the uh the
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
impact yes representative PL yeah I'm
 
02:27:47.190 --> 02:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
confused when you referred 20270 % you
 
02:27:48.190 --> 02:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
mean they wouldn't be able to take
 
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
depreciation at all no what what the 0%
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
mean that is the 168k bonus depreciation
 
02:27:56.269 --> 02:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
the both the business organization will
 
02:27:58.269 --> 02:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
therefore continue to depreciate on the
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
regular depreciation okay so if Federal
 
02:28:03.429 --> 02:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
by in the federal level by 20127 they'll
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
only be able to depreciate on
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
a prata basis for over the life of the
 
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
asset that's correct okay but no no
 
02:28:13.389 --> 02:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
accelerated depreciation correct no no
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
Accel uh well yeah the the modifi the
 
02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:19.070 align:start position:0%
Accel uh well yeah the the modifi the
modified

02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
modified
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
um makers I I can't remember MCR
 
02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
modified uh it's whatever it is yes
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's one okay they were able to
 
02:28:30.950 --> 02:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
follow that yes so depreciation will
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
still be allowed but then there's no
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
bonus there's
 
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
no um early on one lump some
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
depreciation and then the remainder of
 
02:28:43.150 --> 02:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
that over the the useful life of the
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
asset yeah something like modified asset
 
02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
class reduction or something like that
 
02:28:49.630 --> 02:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
but it is it is an accelerated
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
depreciation but this would remove any
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
bonus above that right that's
 
02:28:58.269 --> 02:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:13.950 --> 02:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
you would anyone else like to testify on
 
02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:15.230 align:start position:0%
you would anyone else like to testify on
hp1

02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
hp1
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
1531 see n I'll close the public hearing
 
02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:18.670 align:start position:0%
1531 see n I'll close the public hearing
on

02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:29:21.269 --> 02:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
HP yeah I just like to follow up on that
 
02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and uh ask the Dr provid us
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
with a copy of uh IRC 168k and their
 
02:29:31.950 --> 02:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
analysis of what it actually
 
02:29:35.309 --> 02:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
does okay is that something Dr can
 
02:29:38.429 --> 02:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
do um a
 
02:29:42.190 --> 02:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
um a a description of 168 or
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
168k and also your analysis of what it
 
02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:49.110 align:start position:0%
168k and also your analysis of what it
does

02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:51.070 --> 02:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
I think again the whole point here is
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
we're we're concerned about how does it
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
affect State finances so we just need a
 
02:29:57.950 --> 02:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
good understanding of
 
02:30:00.269 --> 02:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
this okay I'm going to close the public
 
02:30:01.990 --> 02:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
15:31 we'll now open the public hearing
 
02:30:07.269 --> 02:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
on hb1
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
1533 I Rec recognize representative
 
02:30:13.150 --> 02:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
erery thank you Mr chair for the record
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Jordan oler Hillsboro 13 town
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
of Hudson new Hampshire and introducing
 
02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
1533 relative to the safe harbor
 
02:30:23.750 --> 02:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
compensation amount under the business
 
02:30:26.110 --> 02:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
profits tax this bill increases the
 
02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
amount of the Safe Harbor provision for
 
02:30:30.910 --> 02:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
compensation under the business profits
 
02:30:33.630 --> 02:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
tax and provides for biannual increase
 
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
in future years based upon the
 
02:30:39.269 --> 02:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
percentage change in the Consumer Price
 
02:30:42.510 --> 02:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
Index um essentially what this bill does
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
is obviates the need for us to
 
02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
continually make changes
 
02:30:49.590 --> 02:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
and for a period of time what we we did
 
02:30:52.269 --> 02:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
was forgot to make that change so we had
 
02:30:55.630 --> 02:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
to make a a massive change a few years
 
02:30:59.910 --> 02:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
ago and this just allows for the CPI to
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
address the uh inflation index um it's a
 
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
a fair trade for the smaller businessmen
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
because what it allows to do is to take
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
that into consideration so I would urge
 
02:31:15.359 --> 02:31:17.469 align:start position:0%
that into consideration so I would urge
Passage

02:31:17.469 --> 02:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh do we have any questions
 
02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
Hillary seeing none thank
 
02:31:29.230 --> 02:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
you and now I will invite uh
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:49.469 --> 02:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
Aly oh representative elme C city of
 
02:31:52.190 --> 02:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
Lebanon uh
 
02:31:56.830 --> 02:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
District 17 this year I can't remember
 
02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh I just wanted to agree with
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
my colleagues uh about this on when we
 
02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
put in reasonable compensation this is
 
02:32:11.950 --> 02:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
about small
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
businesses uh
 
02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
that and um Partnerships actually that
 
02:32:23.389 --> 02:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
where the member is working in his
 
02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
business and like a snowplow or somebody
 
02:32:33.389 --> 02:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
like that on they uh we put in a major
 
02:32:35.469 --> 02:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
change to the reasonable compensation
 
02:32:38.030 --> 02:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
law in
 
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
2010 um which got delayed because the
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
Republicans worked against it uh and but
 
02:32:49.630 --> 02:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
when you took over you um made took the
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
50,000 that was all Governor Lynch had
 
02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
allowed us and you made it 75,000 which
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
is what we had actually
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
wanted so um this has is a essentially a
 
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisan F figure I checked the
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
inflation and 100,000 is perfectly
 
02:33:11.710 --> 02:33:11.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable at this
 
02:33:15.030 --> 02:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
point uh since
 
02:33:17.309 --> 02:33:17.319 align:start position:0%
2011 uh
 
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
and on I am all
 
02:33:23.990 --> 02:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
for having originated that idea I am all
 
02:33:27.630 --> 02:33:27.640 align:start position:0%
for putting in a CPI fix so that we
 
02:33:30.070 --> 02:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
never end up with small businesses
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
having to pay um pay more than they
 
02:33:38.590 --> 02:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
should be paying thank you great thank
 
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:47.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:33:47.230 --> 02:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:33:50.830 --> 02:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
um I can invite Dr up if anyone has any
 
02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
questions or them
 
02:33:57.830 --> 02:33:57.840 align:start position:0%

02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
you at least that one I knew what I was
 
02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:41.269 align:start position:0%
you at least that one I knew what I was
talking

02:34:41.269 --> 02:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.110 --> 02:34:44.120 align:start position:0%
about okay I will now open the public
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb1 1536 and recognize
 
02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative erery for the record my
 
02:34:51.870 --> 02:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
name is Jordan erery I'm still from
 
02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 13 which is still the town of
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hudson unless the snow moves Hudson
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
around somewhere any any rate just U
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
introducing Bill 1536 FN relative to
 
02:35:05.349 --> 02:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount of the expense
 
02:35:07.830 --> 02:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
deduction allowed against the business
 
02:35:12.830 --> 02:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
profits tax which is similar to uh 15 uh
 
02:35:17.469 --> 02:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
33 in that it's allowing an expense
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
deduction this bill increases the amount
 
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
under Section
 
02:35:26.510 --> 02:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
179 IRC 1 Section uh 179 expense
 
02:35:29.230 --> 02:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
deduction permitted against the business
 
02:35:31.870 --> 02:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
profits tax so it's again it's a
 
02:35:34.349 --> 02:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
relationship between uh New Hampshire
 
02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
tax code and federal tax code and just
 
02:35:39.510 --> 02:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for the businesses to
 
02:35:41.269 --> 02:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
make some deductions and this is the
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
section you were talking about earlier
 
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and
 
02:35:50.349 --> 02:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
with that I'll let IR um Dr explain the
 
02:35:52.269 --> 02:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
the function and how it operates and all
 
02:35:53.550 --> 02:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
that stuff because the other ones are
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
going to have to administer it anyway so
 
02:35:58.230 --> 02:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
they know thank
 
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
you besides it's just sitting in the
 
02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
back doing nothing you might as well
 
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
have them come up here and talk all
 
02:36:05.309 --> 02:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
right if no one has any questions of
 
02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
Representative oler we will say thank
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
up

02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:28.520 align:start position:0%

morning Kim Nong tax policy council with
the

02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:30.920 align:start position:0%

Dr Lauren o solivan senior financial
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
analyst Dr I see that hasn't changed
 
02:36:39.750 --> 02:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
since earlier today it's
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
good all right uh representative Aly you
 
02:36:47.269 --> 02:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you yes on this uh
 
02:36:52.730 --> 02:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
amount was last increased in January 1
 
02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:54.030 align:start position:0%
amount was last increased in January 1
[Music]

02:36:54.030 --> 02:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:36:59.950 --> 02:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
2018 um from 2017 chapter law uh it was
 
02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
raised at that point from a 100,000 to
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
500,000 um and I cannot remember the
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
rationale but we're at 500,000 now this
 
02:37:20.030 --> 02:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
is considerably more than
 
02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
inflation uh this is an
 
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
an increase yet again in um business um
 
02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
Prof profits that we are not
 
02:37:37.309 --> 02:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
taxing uh over the last time we did it
 
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
when it was quite a high
 
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
increase so why did we end up with a
 
02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:51.230 align:start position:0%
increase so why did we end up with a
million

02:37:51.230 --> 02:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
um uh thanks for the question
 
02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
represented Army um the the um I I guess
 
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
the the driver for this uh the bill the
 
02:38:04.349 --> 02:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
details of the bill came from um rep
 
02:38:06.269 --> 02:38:06.279 align:start position:0%
representative Janan uh when he
 
02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
approached us uh to to look into this uh
 
02:38:13.070 --> 02:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
this section of the code and to see if
 
02:38:15.550 --> 02:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
um if it can be updated and I believe
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
that $1 million was uh the amount that
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
was provided by representative er uh
 
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so um can you verify that that
 
02:38:34.269 --> 02:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
change that represent Aly just mentioned
 
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
was um 100 to 500 in 2018 yeah I believe
 
02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's correct um I I don't have those
 
02:38:42.670 --> 02:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
facts with me right now but I remember
 
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
that when we first started it we looked
 
02:38:47.429 --> 02:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
into the history of of the um of this
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
section and the the change of uh what it
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
was before and um how many years ago was
 
02:38:57.429 --> 02:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
that um I I don't my apologies I don't
 
02:38:59.070 --> 02:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
have those details with me but I believe
 
02:39:03.150 --> 02:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:05.630 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:39:05.630 --> 02:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:39:10.830 --> 02:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent Al me um I think I
 
02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
calculated the inflation but I can't
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
since 18 but I can't remember at this
 
02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
Point uh what it
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
was but it was considerably less than
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
this well I guess the other the other
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
component to this would be um
 
02:39:32.830 --> 02:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
certainly looking at inflation but also
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
just reasonable number was was 100,000 a
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable number is 500 well 500,000
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
was um if it was only
 
02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
2018 certainly that's higher than
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
inflation the question
 
02:39:48.389 --> 02:39:48.399 align:start position:0%
is I guess and I'm not sure what the
 
02:39:50.269 --> 02:39:50.279 align:start position:0%
answer to this is what is a reasonable
 
02:39:50.279 --> 02:39:51.990 align:start position:0%
answer to this is what is a reasonable
number

02:39:51.990 --> 02:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:39:54.429 --> 02:39:54.439 align:start position:0%
um that may be something we want to try
 
02:39:56.110 --> 02:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
to figure out because I agree if we're
 
02:39:59.190 --> 02:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
just looking at inflation it's probably
 
02:40:01.469 --> 02:40:01.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to go to a million
 
02:40:04.469 --> 02:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
but if there's other factors that make
 
02:40:08.510 --> 02:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:10.990 --> 02:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure what I don't know if
 
02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
you you would know like what is there
 
02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
how would we determine what a reasonable
 
02:40:16.590 --> 02:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
number is
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
I I believe that's a policy question on
 
02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
what's reasonable or not um okay yeah
 
02:40:25.750 --> 02:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
fair enough yes representative
 
02:40:31.550 --> 02:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
fellows so I'm I'm confused um so this
 
02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
talks about the Internal Revenue code
 
02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:36.349 align:start position:0%
talks about the Internal Revenue code
section

02:40:36.349 --> 02:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:40:40.469 --> 02:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
179 that describes a certain kind of
 
02:40:43.790 --> 02:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
deduction and in the Internal Revenue
 
02:40:46.030 --> 02:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
code is that 500
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
100,000 in the code or is there somehow
 
02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
does it say you can have a deduction but
 
02:40:54.910 --> 02:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
not say how much in the Internal Revenue
 
02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
code um the the current deduction for
 
02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
2022 uh for 179 is 1.08
 
02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:12.830 align:start position:0%
2022 uh for 179 is 1.08
million

02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
1.08 interesting so we are at about the
 
02:41:17.870 --> 02:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
same I because I was trying to remember
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
back to when we were talking about this
 
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
maybe that was the um that was the
 
02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
connection because because obviously
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
that's not not just an inflation
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
adjusted number I think it was a number
 
02:41:32.590 --> 02:41:32.600 align:start position:0%
to try to figure out what what makes
 
02:41:37.389 --> 02:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
um does anyone else have any other
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
this yes represent fellow so the same
 
02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
question I had last time it it says
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
property well no it says except for
 
02:41:51.359 --> 02:41:53.990 align:start position:0%
property well no it says except for
property

02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:41:57.670 --> 02:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
so what what kind of expenses are
 
02:42:02.070 --> 02:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
being deducted here so these expenses
 
02:42:06.389 --> 02:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
are the the cost of um of the
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
asset so instead of depreciating the
 
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
asset over the life of the of the um the
 
02:42:17.150 --> 02:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
asset it is then as an expense in the
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
year of purchase or well in the year
 
02:42:21.710 --> 02:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
that uh the asset was placed in
 
02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
service that's the total of all assets
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
so right it's not like a million dollars
 
02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
per different that's a total number so
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
if you've got 50 assets and they total
 
02:42:34.150 --> 02:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
up to a million or if they total up
 
02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
higher than that you can only take up to
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
correct followup representative
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
fellows so this is ex expense deductions
 
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
did did does this go together with the
 
02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
other Bill be well it's depreciation
 
02:42:57.070 --> 02:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
expense the other one
 
02:43:00.750 --> 02:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
about the other one was the percentage
 
02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
of how much you could take well let uh
 
02:43:06.349 --> 02:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
Dr explain that what's the difference
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
between 16 they are similar um both
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
deals with the the cost of the
 
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
asset um whereas um from the federal
 
02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
perspective uh the 168k bonus
 
02:43:23.429 --> 02:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
depreciation uh it's a percentage um of
 
02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
the of the cost of the asset that is
 
02:43:29.950 --> 02:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
allow uh accelerated on the first year
 
02:43:32.269 --> 02:43:32.279 align:start position:0%
of placing in service and then the
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
remainder of that cost of the asset is
 
02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
is depreciated over the remaining life
 
02:43:38.590 --> 02:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:43:42.269 --> 02:43:42.279 align:start position:0%
asset whereas 179k is
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
a is a 100% deduction
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
but up to the total income uh a total
 
02:43:51.950 --> 02:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
amount of a well a million dollars now
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
under the bill current law is
 
02:44:00.750 --> 02:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
500,000 I guess our is is section one
 
02:44:08.030 --> 02:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
one 168 and Section 179 is there a
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
crossover that's or they different
 
02:44:13.790 --> 02:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
assets the the so if the asset if the
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayer chooses to use if they if the
 
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
asset qualifies for either one and
 
02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer chooses one over the other they
 
02:44:22.389 --> 02:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
can't do both at the same time so taking
 
02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
like a double deduction kind of
 
02:44:26.630 --> 02:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
situation no so that so the taxpayer
 
02:44:33.630 --> 02:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:37.030 --> 02:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay I think the this
 
02:44:39.630 --> 02:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
the the a little bit of confusion on my
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
part anyhow would
 
02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
be under HP 1531 there's aund um we're
 
02:44:49.230 --> 02:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 100% deduction with
 
02:44:54.190 --> 02:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
no limit so why would anyone
 
02:44:58.150 --> 02:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
ever use this
 
02:45:01.230 --> 02:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
deduction or am I misunderstanding
 
02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:10.389 --> 02:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
um because I guess when they're both
 
02:45:13.150 --> 02:45:13.160 align:start position:0%
100% then there there won't be any
 
02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
difference whereas if you're looking
 
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
from a federal perspective when you have
 
02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
that before 100% was like
 
02:45:24.990 --> 02:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
50% and then it was 100% during tcj and
 
02:45:27.309 --> 02:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
then there was that phase out each
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
year-over year it depends I I suppose it
 
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
depends on the the business itself if
 
02:45:33.750 --> 02:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
the business thinks that okay they
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
rather um allocate that depreciation
 
02:45:38.670 --> 02:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
spread it out over the number of years
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
but maybe get a large deduction in the
 
02:45:43.790 --> 02:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
first year and then still have some
 
02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
remaining depreciation to offset income
 
02:45:50.590 --> 02:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
over the the the their future years or
 
02:45:53.230 --> 02:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
if they want to do the 179 and they
 
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
qualify for the 179 take that and take
 
02:45:59.070 --> 02:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
100% during the first year and then
 
02:46:01.150 --> 02:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
nothing else for the remainder of the
 
02:46:03.349 --> 02:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
the useful life of the asset so that
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:10.710 --> 02:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
options okay thank you yes represent me
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I might have Mi misunderstood
 
02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
something but how do you not qualify for
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
179 except by not having enough money to
 
02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
be able to get to
 
02:46:26.750 --> 02:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
it yes so the 179
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
um I I believe the so the 179
 
02:46:36.030 --> 02:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
is has that limitation of um of that
 
02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:38.710 align:start position:0%
is has that limitation of um of that
five

02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
$500,000 um on the federal side on the
 
02:46:45.150 --> 02:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
federal side that limitation is the
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
$1.08 million based on a 2.7 million
 
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
capital expenditure spend capital
 
02:46:52.670 --> 02:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
expenditure uh
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
spend um so it the 179 has very has that
 
02:47:02.710 --> 02:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
sort of income limitation requirement
 
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
that needs to be looked into before they
 
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
can take that deduction whereas the 168k
 
02:47:12.349 --> 02:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
that yes follow up so does that that
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
mean that um a business that's capable
 
02:47:23.710 --> 02:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
of um buying a
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
179 but a startup or another small
 
02:47:42.950 --> 02:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
business smaller business could only use
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
the other
 
02:47:51.309 --> 02:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:58.670 --> 02:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:02.150 --> 02:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and the asset classes are the same
 
02:48:04.110 --> 02:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
they cover the same asset
 
02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
classes they are same uh there might be
 
02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
some some differences but usually uh in
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
the lar in the large part they are the
 
02:48:15.910 --> 02:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
same there there probably are some
 
02:48:19.670 --> 02:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
some distinctions between the 179 assets
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
and the 168k
 
02:48:25.269 --> 02:48:25.279 align:start position:0%
assets yes represent
 
02:48:29.269 --> 02:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
fellows so what if the company is
 
02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
headquarters in New Hampshire does this
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
apply to assets that they buy and but
 
02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
they the asset never comes to New
 
02:48:40.950 --> 02:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it could be somewhere
 
02:48:43.870 --> 02:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
else it does not this bill or the
 
02:48:46.389 --> 02:48:46.399 align:start position:0%
current law for 179 does not distinguish
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
whether the the business organization is
 
02:48:51.070 --> 02:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
headquartered in New Hampshire or not in
 
02:48:52.429 --> 02:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or whether the assets are
 
02:48:54.309 --> 02:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
placed in service in New Hampshire or
 
02:48:56.790 --> 02:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire as long as it's say
 
02:49:01.630 --> 02:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
they business profits tax filers and um
 
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
and they have these assets that place in
 
02:49:10.790 --> 02:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:12.830 --> 02:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
qualify any other
 
02:49:15.550 --> 02:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
questions represent Aly
 
02:49:18.030 --> 02:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that if we have a
 
02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:19.910 align:start position:0%
so does that mean that if we have a
business

02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:49:24.030 --> 02:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
here uh which is doing absolutely no
 
02:49:26.710 --> 02:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
improvement of its business
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
here uh but it has it's making
 
02:49:33.590 --> 02:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
improvements in a bunch of other places
 
02:49:37.190 --> 02:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
we're paying for
 
02:49:41.570 --> 02:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:41.580 --> 02:49:43.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:52.670 align:start position:0%
[Music]
elsewhere

02:49:52.670 --> 02:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:59.070 --> 02:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
so well I mean what's interesting about
 
02:50:02.269 --> 02:50:02.279 align:start position:0%
this is we aren't changing the the
 
02:50:04.070 --> 02:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
spirit of the law we're changing an
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
um my my belief is there's got to be
 
02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
some um we need to look into it but
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some
 
02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
thing that makes sense about this
 
02:50:22.349 --> 02:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise yes follow if I could on it
 
02:50:26.229 --> 02:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
was only fairly recently four
 
02:50:31.309 --> 02:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
years five years more on where that we
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
had an actual uh policy
 
02:50:40.990 --> 02:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
analysis capability in
 
02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
Dr and so what we were doing in in
 
02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
earlier years was not benefiting
 
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
from a number of misconceptions that
 
02:50:54.910 --> 02:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
we'v been operating on
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
before so I think it's it's worth
 
02:51:01.190 --> 02:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
examining things as we go
 
02:51:04.389 --> 02:51:04.399 align:start position:0%
through yes represent ORS thank you Mr
 
02:51:06.510 --> 02:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
so if I can clarify I believe that
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
whether it is or isn't which you
 
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
struggle with which I was thinking about
 
02:51:17.830 --> 02:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
also the amount is immaterial would you
 
02:51:17.840 --> 02:51:21.030 align:start position:0%
also the amount is immaterial would you
agree

02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:24.910 --> 02:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
or the changes in material
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:33.110 --> 02:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
subjective well I just mudded that water
 
02:51:37.269 --> 02:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
didn't I thank you he doesn't have boots
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
on yes representative fellows so I you
 
02:51:43.389 --> 02:51:43.399 align:start position:0%
know this is my first year on Ways and
 
02:51:47.389 --> 02:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
Means and and so you know I just try to
 
02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
I need things at fairly simple level to
 
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
try to understand them so my
 
02:51:55.510 --> 02:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of like the business
 
02:51:59.429 --> 02:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
profits tax is that if a big company
 
02:52:02.110 --> 02:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
like Walmart you know they have huge
 
02:52:04.349 --> 02:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
amounts of Revenue huge amounts of
 
02:52:07.870 --> 02:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures the amount of profit that
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
they have are taxed on by New Hampshire
 
02:52:15.070 --> 02:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
is in relation to the amount of
 
02:52:18.510 --> 02:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
Assets in that they have in New
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the amount of their say
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
something about we're they're not paying
 
02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
taxes on on all of their entire
 
02:52:31.990 --> 02:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
operation just a little slice of it in
 
02:52:35.550 --> 02:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that and and then then
 
02:52:37.990 --> 02:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
I if that's like somewhere in the
 
02:52:40.150 --> 02:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
ballpark of
 
02:52:46.269 --> 02:52:46.279 align:start position:0%
of correct then this given them these
 
02:52:49.190 --> 02:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
deductions for assets purchased in the
 
02:52:52.830 --> 02:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
whole country world just doesn't make
 
02:52:56.229 --> 02:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
any sense to me so can you help me
 
02:52:56.239 --> 02:52:57.870 align:start position:0%
any sense to me so can you help me
understand

02:52:57.870 --> 02:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:53:01.349 --> 02:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
it so uh a lar business organization
 
02:53:03.590 --> 02:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
carrying conducting business activity in
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and outside of New
 
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh will potentially be filing
 
02:53:11.630 --> 02:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
a a a unitary um combined filing return
 
02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh where
 
02:53:15.710 --> 02:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's business income would be a
 
02:53:18.269 --> 02:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
portioned so uh that portion that's
 
02:53:19.710 --> 02:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
subject that's a portion to New
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be subject to um that
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
will create a factor ratio uh multiply
 
02:53:29.750 --> 02:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the taxable item in New Hampshire
 
02:53:32.070 --> 02:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
and multiply with the uh the applicable
 
02:53:35.349 --> 02:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tax rate um the the
 
02:53:37.790 --> 02:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
apportionment factor is changed from the
 
02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
Tre Factor appr pment the Tre factor
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
aport which was the sales payroll and
 
02:53:45.429 --> 02:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
property so the numerator of that factor
 
02:53:47.229 --> 02:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
is the sales the New Hampshire sales
 
02:53:49.590 --> 02:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
over the total sales everywhere sales
 
02:53:51.630 --> 02:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
the payroll factor is the New Hampshire
 
02:53:54.389 --> 02:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
payroll over the total payroll and the
 
02:53:56.229 --> 02:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
property factor is the New Hampshire
 
02:53:58.870 --> 02:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
property over the total property uh that
 
02:54:01.070 --> 02:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
has changed to the single sales factor
 
02:54:03.670 --> 02:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
which is not only just sales so it's
 
02:54:06.070 --> 02:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire sales over total
 
02:54:08.229 --> 02:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
sales everywhere the property the number
 
02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
of assets that's um value of the assets
 
02:54:15.950 --> 02:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire does not affect the um
 
02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:21.910 --> 02:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
factor I think that I think that kind of
 
02:54:23.309 --> 02:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
I mean I'll let you do a follow-up but I
 
02:54:25.510 --> 02:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
think that kind of answers the question
 
02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
that we just had a few minutes back
 
02:54:29.830 --> 02:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
where the question was asked is somebody
 
02:54:33.110 --> 02:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
else benefiting from that the answer is
 
02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's a portioned so if they're if
 
02:54:36.190 --> 02:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
they're just trying to do that and
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
barely doing any business in New
 
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're not going to be able
 
02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
to deduct that full amount they can only
 
02:54:43.830 --> 02:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
deduct a percentage that's related to
 
02:54:45.030 --> 02:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
what business they're doing in New
 
02:54:47.550 --> 02:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that that's kind of the
 
02:54:50.550 --> 02:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
the the gate that that throttles it back
 
02:54:54.510 --> 02:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
yes follow up so I understand the factor
 
02:54:56.190 --> 02:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
that's like a essentially it's going to
 
02:54:58.710 --> 02:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
be a percentage of their profits that
 
02:55:01.070 --> 02:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
they you know I don't know 2% or
 
02:55:04.030 --> 02:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
something that they owe to New Hampshire
 
02:55:06.910 --> 02:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
but these bills are
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
reducing what their profit would be
 
02:55:14.429 --> 02:55:14.439 align:start position:0%
because they they are able to take those
 
02:55:17.070 --> 02:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
deductions for those purchases in the
 
02:55:21.070 --> 02:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
first year right and then just to Echo
 
02:55:23.630 --> 02:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
what representative Jen saying these
 
02:55:27.269 --> 02:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
adjustments are before approp uh before
 
02:55:29.070 --> 02:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
apportionment and they will still be
 
02:55:31.510 --> 02:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
subject to the apportionment
 
02:55:36.349 --> 02:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:38.590 --> 02:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
the well then they have to be a
 
02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
portioned correct so if if there's a
 
02:55:43.229 --> 02:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars to deduct but they're
 
02:55:45.510 --> 02:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
only doing 2% of their business you can
 
02:55:46.910 --> 02:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong 2% of their
 
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire then they can
 
02:55:52.389 --> 02:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
only deduct 2% of the $1 million yes so
 
02:55:54.349 --> 02:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
you take the deduction you you get the
 
02:55:56.469 --> 02:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
deductions first and then you come up
 
02:55:58.469 --> 02:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
with a net number and then apply that
 
02:56:01.389 --> 02:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
net number against the oppor factor how
 
02:56:04.269 --> 02:56:04.279 align:start position:0%
what's the New Hampshire piece of it
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
like um if you say it was 2% it was 2%
 
02:56:09.910 --> 02:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and then multiply that
 
02:56:12.510 --> 02:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
with the uh the New Hampshire rate the
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
tax rate yes representative ORS thank
 
02:56:19.389 --> 02:56:19.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:56:21.710 --> 02:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
question would you believe that
 
02:56:25.110 --> 02:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
accounting is not cut and dry that it's
 
02:56:28.630 --> 02:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
not just plus and minuses and that it's
 
02:56:28.640 --> 02:56:29.990 align:start position:0%
not just plus and minuses and that it's
very

02:56:29.990 --> 02:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:56:33.110 --> 02:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
complicated and that the answer the
 
02:56:37.550 --> 02:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
depends yes I do believe um accounting
 
02:56:43.110 --> 02:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
is complicated that was very
 
02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:56:51.830 --> 02:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions all right and I'm sure we will
 
02:56:54.150 --> 02:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
talk about this some more during a work
 
02:56:57.550 --> 02:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
session um yes if if I thank you Mr
 
02:56:59.269 --> 02:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
chair if I could just jump in for a
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
second and and say would you believe
 
02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
that accounting and tax law the tax law
 
02:57:09.389 --> 02:57:09.399 align:start position:0%
is like six million pages I believe in
 
02:57:11.950 --> 02:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
the federal sector New Hampshire's I'm
 
02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
sure less than that
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
and and would you believe that it's very
 
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
convoluted would you believe
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
that yes I I would believe that yeah
 
02:57:24.030 --> 02:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay any other
 
02:57:24.040 --> 02:57:26.229 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay any other
representative

02:57:26.229 --> 02:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:57:38.349 --> 02:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:40.510 --> 02:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair for the
 
02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to add to this and and
 
02:57:45.510 --> 02:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me one minute uh I'll need Dr to
 
02:57:48.429 --> 02:57:48.439 align:start position:0%
fill out unfortunately three more pink
 
02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
cards HP 1531 1533 and
 
02:57:56.590 --> 02:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
1536 thank you yes representative
 
02:57:59.269 --> 02:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
oler uh the the listening to the
 
02:58:01.389 --> 02:58:01.399 align:start position:0%
discussion came to mind a new business
 
02:58:03.590 --> 02:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's coming into uh well two of them
 
02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
actually into Hudson 500,000 square foot
 
02:58:10.269 --> 02:58:10.279 align:start position:0%
uh Warehouse operations both of these
 
02:58:13.389 --> 02:58:13.399 align:start position:0%
facilities will have electric uh ponies
 
02:58:14.670 --> 02:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
or Don
 
02:58:18.110 --> 02:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh trucks to move trailers around on the
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
property that's a vehicle that would
 
02:58:23.830 --> 02:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
that would is going to cost it's a
 
02:58:27.229 --> 02:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
depreciable expense to that particular
 
02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
company uh for the operation of that
 
02:58:32.950 --> 02:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
particular facility um and would be
 
02:58:36.990 --> 02:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
subject to 168k because it's a
 
02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:38.550 align:start position:0%
subject to 168k because it's a
short-term

02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
02:58:42.229 --> 02:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
depreciable item uh depending upon who
 
02:58:44.309 --> 02:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
makes batteries it may be very short
 
02:58:47.229 --> 02:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
term the first time it gets wet or it
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
may be long term depending upon what
 
02:58:53.389 --> 02:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
goes on um but at any rate that that
 
02:58:56.309 --> 02:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
would be an example of that while inside
 
02:58:56.319 --> 02:58:58.030 align:start position:0%
would be an example of that while inside
the

02:58:58.030 --> 02:58:58.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:59:00.349 --> 02:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
business they're going to be using some
 
02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
Advanced robotics from uh and they're
 
02:59:05.590 --> 02:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
working with u the company down there on
 
02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
route 3i robot uh
 
02:59:11.030 --> 02:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
for taking items that come off of the
 
02:59:13.389 --> 02:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
trucks that are put out and then stacked
 
02:59:15.469 --> 02:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
up and stored according to this then
 
02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
pulled out of stock and shipped out to
 
02:59:21.150 --> 02:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
the various distribution points this is
 
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
a selection for distribution warehouse
 
02:59:28.670 --> 02:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
It's called a distribution warehouse
 
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
surprisingly um that
 
02:59:36.510 --> 02:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
robot its own cost besides
 
02:59:36.520 --> 02:59:39.030 align:start position:0%
robot its own cost besides
inflation

02:59:39.030 --> 02:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
02:59:41.229 --> 02:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
is rather
 
02:59:43.510 --> 02:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
expensive but we all benefit from it
 
02:59:45.190 --> 02:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
because we pay less for the broom that
 
02:59:49.389 --> 02:59:49.399 align:start position:0%
we buy or the iroot that we buy although
 
02:59:52.590 --> 02:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
you can buy one I'm not going to um at
 
02:59:55.790 --> 02:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
any rate that's that's I I I would hope
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
that Dr could determine whether or not
 
03:00:00.750 --> 03:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
that's a a good example of the
 
03:00:03.750 --> 03:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
differences between the application of
 
03:00:08.070 --> 03:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
179 and 168 whereas one is a shortterm
 
03:00:10.830 --> 03:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
in my understanding and the other one is
 
03:00:14.309 --> 03:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
a major expense to the company whether
 
03:00:16.550 --> 03:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
they're allowing uh on the federal level
 
03:00:19.910 --> 03:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
1.8 million we're going to be allowing 1
 
03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
million at the at the state level for a
 
03:00:24.590 --> 03:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
a massive infusion of a different
 
03:00:28.630 --> 03:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
product and different U um
 
03:00:33.269 --> 03:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
operation device represent PL is it true
 
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
that for purposes of taxes we don't care
 
03:00:37.110 --> 03:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
whether that's in new H Hudson New
 
03:00:39.429 --> 03:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or California it's the amount
 
03:00:41.950 --> 03:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
of sales in New Hampshire over sales
 
03:00:44.190 --> 03:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
Nationwide times the profit Prof that's
 
03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
calculated with this calculation
 
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
whatever they said yeah but it's it's a
 
03:00:51.309 --> 03:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
material that is in New Hampshire this
 
03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
case it's sales in New Hampshire well
 
03:00:56.389 --> 03:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
yeah but the operation in of the
 
03:00:58.710 --> 03:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
companies that I provided were are going
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
to be both um on exe well on the old
 
03:01:04.830 --> 03:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
golf course and on Friar's Drive in
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:12.030 --> 03:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:14.349 --> 03:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:01:18.550 --> 03:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:21.269 --> 03:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
1536 seeing none I will close the public
 
03:01:25.229 --> 03:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:33.309 --> 03:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
well yeah now you can take an hour for
 
03:01:35.870 --> 03:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
lunch you don't have to come back here
 
03:01:40.670 --> 03:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so tomorrow um I will see hopefully
 
03:01:44.750 --> 03:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
see you all and and a few more uh 10:00
 
03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:45.790 align:start position:0%

and

03:01:45.790 --> 03:01:45.800 align:start position:0%

um we have we have five five again five
 
03:01:51.229 --> 03:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
bills to do I don't know that you know
 
03:01:53.630 --> 03:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
again we'll have to take the the
 
03:01:55.429 --> 03:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
temperature of how things are going and
 
03:01:57.110 --> 03:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
maybe take a lunch break or maybe get it
 
03:01:58.710 --> 03:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
done if we get done by one I think
 
03:01:58.720 --> 03:02:00.469 align:start position:0%
done if we get done by one I think
that's

03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:02:04.870 --> 03:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
preferable tomorrow yes it's 10
 
03:02:08.670 --> 03:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
o' no that that was a suggestion I think
 
03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:10.229 align:start position:0%
o' no that that was a suggestion I think
um

03:02:10.229 --> 03:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
