owned by the
 
00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
agency uh the the third one the board of
 
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
home inspectors needs a waiver as well
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
because I apologize Madam chair um the
 
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
first item 20
 
00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
2397 that item they're actually asking
 
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
to be moved till March because the board
 
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
does not meet until February 16th so
 
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
that one if it is accepted would need a
 
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
waiver as
 
00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 align:start position:0%

well thank you for that clarification so
the

the
 
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
the motion would be to
 
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
postpone item a to the March meeting and
 
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
request a waiver and postpone B and C to
 
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
the February meeting and C need also
 
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
needs a waiver of its deadline that is
 
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
my motion thank you representative schm
 
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
any discussion comments
 
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
questions all right those in favor I I
 
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
those opposed all right madam chair I
 
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
don't believe there was a second
 
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
second I thought I heard representative
 
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
Lynn but I could be
 
00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
right yes you
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
did all right Senator gray you're
 
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
sitting in for Senator Lang who doesn't
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
Services so this proposal has one sort
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
of minor issue it's a a very broad
 
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
citation and um think we think for
 
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
clarity purposes it should be a more
 
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
specific citation but I think that the
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
fix for this is just an oral CA just to
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
say what citation to change it to so
 
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
suggestion okay uh good morning Nicole
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
Valena rules coordin Ator for the
 
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh yes that's correct we uh it was a
 
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding on my part I had
 
00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 align:start position:0%
responded and saying yes we could make
 
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
that edit I didn't submit I thought it
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
was an edit not a conditional approval
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
request so if you will allow that I will
 
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.629 align:start position:0%
request so if you will allow that I will
do

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
that okay any questions from the
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee a motion um I can move a
 
00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
conditional approval um citing HW um
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
5022 um in as noted by the
 
00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys second okay any any further
 
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
any discussion questions or
 
00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
comments those in favor I
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
opposed okay Board of mental health
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
practice okay this item was postponed
 
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
from the last meeting um because there
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
had been some testimonies submitted from
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Behavioral Health
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
Association and the committee felt that
 
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 align:start position:0%
the um that the board needed to revisit
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
um that the letters that were submitted
 
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
and to um consider maybe making some
 
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
changes to the rule um there is linked
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
on our website an amended um the an
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval request it
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
may be titled a revised conditional
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
approval request but if you look on the
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
third page of the linked PDF you will
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
see that the board has made some changes
 
00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
there um the association had had um
 
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
stated that they felt that the required
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
um hours 4,000 hours couldn't be met
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
within um well one they misunderstood
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
the rule they thought that that um the
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
maximum that was allowed was 2,000 hours
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
but the rule in fact does say a minimum
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
and um and then they also felt that that
 
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
the rule forced people to get those
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
required hours within um 2year time
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
period but that's not what the rule said
 
00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
um the board has tweaked the rule a
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
little bit to address those issues and
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
and I think it it's fine if you look
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
there on like I said on page three of
 
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
the linked PDF they've changed that to
 
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 align:start position:0%
be clear that it that the 4 hours 4,000
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
hours have to be completed within 2
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
years but no more than 4 years so I
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
think that's a little clear and then I
 
00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879 align:start position:0%
believe um also on the next page they
 
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
made the same change so um with that I
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
have no other issues there are a couple
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
other editorial comments but I had
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
nothing else on this
 
00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.070 align:start position:0%
nothing else on this
proposal

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair members of
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
the committee Lindsay Courtney executive
 
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
director office of professional ice
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
Insurance certification so I will
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
address um the the stakeholder concerns
 
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
and then I'll defer um to a r making
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
coordinator as well as the board chair
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
who's present regarding any other
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
changes the board has made um I did have
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
a lengthy conversation with the
 
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholder who had concerns with this
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
rule to get a better understanding of
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
what the concerns were and it appears
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
that the concerns really stem from a
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of the enabling statute
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
um that allows this rule to move forward
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
so if you may recall I think it was back
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
in 2019 legislative session um the
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
legislature established additional
 
00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:00.199 align:start position:0%
license types for for the board of
 
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
mental health practice um two of those
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
license types were to establish add
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
different additional categories licensed
 
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
Social Work associate for those educated
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
at the associate um degree level um
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
licensed social worker for those
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
educated with a b balarat and then the
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
statute also established conditional
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
licenses which are the license types
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
that were at issue or brought forward
 
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
with the stakeholder concerns so several
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
other states have a fourth category of
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
lure which is a non-clinical category of
 
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
lure for Master's educated um
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
individuals Vermont is is one of those
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
States um and there was some confusion
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
that the conditional license the the
 
00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
enabling statute establishing the
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
conditional licenses was establishing
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
that fourth category and so with the
 
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that essentially this
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
would be a permanent license for
 
00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
non-clinical work at the Master's level
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
they had concerns with essentially the
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
4year cap on having that license um I
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
think we Now understand that the statute
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
did not establish that category um and
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
that that if they do wish to move
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
forward with establishing that category
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
that they're um they need to do so
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislatively so that's kind of the gist
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
of um the stakeholder
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
concerns I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
questions and i' defer if if I
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
understand correctly from some other
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislation in process the conditional
 
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
license is so that a person who has
 
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
graduated but is getting their
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
supervised practice has a license so
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
that they can independently bill that's
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
correct at least Bill somebody yes
 
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.550 align:start position:0%
correct at least Bill somebody yes
that's

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:09:52.269 --> 00:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:07.630 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
good morning Tina Kelly rules
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
coordinator for
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
oplc if you have any other questions I'd
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
okay think you've answered all our
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
questions thank you all right do we have
 
00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:26.190 align:start position:0%
questions thank you all right do we have
a

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
second discussion questions
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
comments those in favor I
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
opposed okay thank you very
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
Council so this was also a proposal that
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
was um postponed from the last meeting
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a conditional approval that
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
was sent in and there seems to only be
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
one remaining issue it's on page
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
35 and it's essentially the the
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
deadlines that the agency is setting do
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
not comply with 541a 29 and so that's
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
now good morning good morning my name is
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
Mark elano I attorney general turn the
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
mic on please I'm sorry thank you I'm
 
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:28.519 align:start position:0%
better than that generally uh good
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
morning my my name is Mark Delano I'm an
 
00:11:31.949 --> 00:11:31.959 align:start position:0%
Assistant Attorney General from the
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and I represent
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
the water
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
Council uh there are actually two issues
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
on in the conditional approval that
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
appear to be uh left in from comments
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
from uh legislative Services we'll deal
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
with the first one on
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
33 uh
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
firstly that
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
comment uh states that uh that the the
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
rule on declaratory rulings must comply
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
with RSA 541
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
a29 the the language of RSA uh 541 a29
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
in fact exempts declaratory rulings from
 
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.910 align:start position:0%
in fact exempts declaratory rulings from
the

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
statute we wrote a letter to uh
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
legislative Services regarding this
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
issue and uh we never received a
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
response other than finding ourselves on
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay I did not receive that letter but I
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
I see what you're saying now in the rule
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
about declaratory ruling we we would
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
have changed that comment if we had seen
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
that now one thing to just mention here
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
as well is that the water Council rules
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
are the same uh with some minor changes
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
that are water Council specific to the
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
rules for the other three environmental
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
councils so the air Resources Council
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
the waste management Council and the uh
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh Wetlands Council uh these rules are
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
for the most part uniform across all of
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
them so some of these changes for
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
instance the one that was suggested on
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
page 33 was never suggested in either of
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
the three prior uh versions of the other
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
council's rules but otherwise are
 
00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:27.959 align:start position:0%
materially the same uh the other comment
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
that remained is on page uh 32 Madam
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
chair just yes to on that one make sure
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
that you guys do forward a letter to
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
them that they didn't receive so their
 
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
records are complete absolutely I
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
brought a copy with me today appreciate
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
that on page 32 on page 32 uh on item D
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
and this is uh
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
ECW uh
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
217d uh we had suggested um well first
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
off legislative Services had crossed out
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
the May and asked us to insert sha the
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
other three Council rules have May and
 
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
the reason why we would prefer a May
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
there than a shall is because this is a
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
removal provision the presiding officer
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
can remove Council for a party at one of
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
these hearings uh but we want that to be
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
a permissive removal not a mandatory
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
removal and so our suggested change was
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
to go from they said shall we said is
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
authorized to and that would a departure
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
from the May language that's in the
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
rules thank you um
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
comment would note that the language
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
that was suggested is equivalent to
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
saying May is when you say is authorized
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
to right well I think that
 
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
the subcategories one and two look like
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
the criteria for a removal and therefore
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
May would would be not unreasonable in
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
my opinion agree I I believe I've looked
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
at this Rule and some of the other ones
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
that they've brought forward before and
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
I think that's where the committee had
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
landed on that particular issue and I
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
believe on um on the other issue on
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
declaratory judgments that um like
 
00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
Christina said if we had seen that then
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
that would have been we would have
 
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
removed that
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
comment okay any other questions
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
comments concerns
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
do we have a motion I'd like to move the
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
question so you're moving to approve the
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
rule thank you sorry moving trouble
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
second okay discussion comment those in
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
favor I
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
opposed okay thank you very much I'm
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
 
Agriculture

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
so 2023 243 is an agricultural role on
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
acquisition of agricultural land
 
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
development rights and um there are
 
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
still a
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
few um issues with the rule starting on
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
page two there's a rule that requires
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
filing an application with the committee
 
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
and municipality and then later it needs
 
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
to be with the agent and so there it
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
just needs to be more consistency there
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
so a person knows where they're filing
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
and with who um there's a few places
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
where the the wording is just unclear
 
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
it's just unclear as written and should
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
be changed that's on page four and five
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
and on page
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
12 um page six there's deadlines that
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
don't comply with um 541
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
a29 um and on page eight there's some uh
 
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
subjective language that we would like
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
changed um because subjective Lang
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
ORS commissioner yeah this could have
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
been fixed probably with a conditional
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
approval so I'm sorry I said this these
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
these issues could have been fixed with
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval okay thank
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
you uh good morning this is Patricia
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
Benner for um I'm the legislative
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the Department of
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
Agriculture um and I apologize for uh
 
00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:36.039 align:start position:0%
not having the conditional approval um
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
in time um I think there there wasn't
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
much turnaround from receiving
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
committee's uh comments but we are
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
working on correcting those issues and
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
clarifying some of the um um ambiguity
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
in the new
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
rule um should we postpone dealing with
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
this until you have the had the
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity you complet it well thank
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
you and um for the record Sean Jasper
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the department and um I
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
think we were a little unclear where we
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
were supposed to go with these changes
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
we have made suggested
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
changes um but didn't appear that there
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
was any place for us to submit them in
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
in time so we have the language but
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
been a long time since I sat on the
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
committee and things have changed and we
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
really weren't expecting this because we
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
were it was a read-option and obviously
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
these things were in the rules that had
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh previously been in place but okay I
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to discuss what
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
we have suggested or
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
not a a postponement with a waiver would
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
would be in order and that would give us
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
time we can we can work with the agency
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
yes and please make sure that
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
that your
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
instructions on how to respond to
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
comments are clearer yes we'd hate to
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
have this happen again yes okay so um
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'll motion and postponement
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
second le le on second okay thank you I
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
didn't hear you all right
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
it further discussion those in favor
 
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.950 align:start position:0%
it further discussion those in favor
I

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
post thank you and before you go we
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
might as well deal with the fact that
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
the previous rules have been expired for
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
15 years and I'm wondering what you've
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
done since then we have not purchased
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
any properties since then because we had
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
no money and that's why they were
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to to expire I will um let you
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
let you know that um right now there's a
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
statutory change and we weren't in
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
anticipating that these rules would
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily be used because we'll be
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
working with other organizations however
 
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
we've had some pretty exciting news to
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
us that a land owner in uh Dublin where
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
we do hold current easements wants to
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
donation um of additional land so the
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
rules are going to be necessar even
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
though there's not going to be any uh
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
money exchanged I think we'll still need
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
to use to have this donation so they're
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
looking to to move forward uh and guess
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
we can't do anything till we get that
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
and the committee um is being
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
reconstituted and at the next GNC the
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
the um new newest members of the
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
committee will be appointed and we'll be
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
back up and and running so apologize
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
that we had some some confusion about
 
00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
what was going on here and um okay well
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to know that the you haven't
 
00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
been enforcing expir rules no
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
right good morning Senator gray you're
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
game so this rule is 2023 248 licenses
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
and permits and I actually the the
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
agency did a great job at um responding
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
to my comments so there's only one issue
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
which I think is solved because it's a
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
typo on the there's there's a typo on
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
the revision note of one of the forms
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
and I think you guys fixed that right so
 
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
then I have no more no more
 
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.230 align:start position:0%
then I have no more no more
comments

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
okay good morning I'm Marty Mobley I'm
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
the Le coordinator for fishing game and
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
and with me today hi good morning my
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
name is Jessica wheelan I'm the
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
licensing supervisor for fishing
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
game we recently had a new
 
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
um website uh instituted and so we put
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
all of our licensing forms online so the
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the changes we're doing
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
is to add the link to the online
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
licenses um and there were a couple of
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
other updates to go along with we
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
updated some Wildlife rules that went
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
into effect in June so we needed to make
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
a couple of changes on some of our
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
licenses to include an additional Bear
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
Tag um and and a couple of other little
 
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
tweets but that's this is mostly just to
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
be consistent I didn't get the comments
 
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
I still haven't got the comments so I
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
would and I agree all of the uh comments
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
could have been addressed in a
 
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
conditional approval um but I did speak
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
with Christina last week and I got her
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
the form that I had neglected to uh
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
include in the Orin original final
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
proposal and then there is the typo that
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
that dis disagreed that I had put
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
zero there a problem
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
getting messages in and out of your
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
office I don't know but it seems like
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
there may be so we're going to go ahead
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
and go back and look at into that is
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
that I know what's going
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
on so if I understand you correctly the
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
you finally received the comments and
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
are willing to to make a conditional
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
approval request incorporating those
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
comments is that can I make a
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request I don't
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
think a conditional appr because the
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
only issue is on a form and so the form
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
just needs to be Ed
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
edited I think no I think it's the text
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be edited the form I think is
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
correct or I don't know I'd have to look
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
up I'd have to look if the text needs to
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
approval yeah I think I think because I
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
think it's the text that says 01 the
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
revised yeah and and the form says Madam
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
chair is a motion to approve uh pending
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
the uh incorporation of the comments
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate at this time I believe it
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
would be I move second pending
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
incorporation any further comments or
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee okay those in favor I post all
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much and please uh
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
hope we can get the communication issue
 
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.630 align:start position:0%
hope we can get the communication issue
straightened

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
right and me think oh that's we don't
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
have the water sa watercraft safety
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
rules yet correct that is correct we've
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
not received that response but the
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
agency has until February 5th to submit
 
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:11.780 align:start position:0%
that to us okay so no trouble and
 
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.470 align:start position:0%
that to us okay so no trouble and
[Music]

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
the home builders and uh contractors are
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
still talking with Dees about alteration
 
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
of terrain and not ready to talk to
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
us and this
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:28.590 align:start position:0%
us and this
petition

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
petition
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um most of the
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee probably has not seen this
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
before but under RSA 541a for an
 
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
individual can petition an agency uh to
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
amend or adopt rules or repeal rules um
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
and under the committee's own rules um

Jael car to petition the agency uh the
 
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
requirement for that is that they first
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
um petition the agency and be denied in
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
this instance um clients of Donald funin
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
have uh requested that they be able to
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
they apparently sell vacation homes um
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
right now the rules of uh doj require
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
that the packet of materials uh
 
00:26:27.789 --> 00:26:27.799 align:start position:0%
regarding sales must be uh hard copy um
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
the request for the petition ask that
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%

apparently feels and they're here I
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
believe uh that uh because of the
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
importance of such a sale that it's
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
better to have it in paper than
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
electronically that uh the potential
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
purchasers May pay more attention to a
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%

Justice attorney general's office uh we
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this proposed change
 
00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
before I go through any of the details I
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that the
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
committee has the benefit of the letter
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we transmitted electronically to
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
yesterday um I believe that's in our
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
pack the last one on a page of our
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
packet last three pages of our packet in
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
a the thicker packet contains both the
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
request uh from Mr fonstein and uh the
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
AG's response in a separate attachment
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
are the current uh Jus rules that uh the
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
to and I'm at the preference of the
 
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
committee whether you want us to go
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
explain the basis for for our objection
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
to the change of our longstanding rule
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
or to respond uh once the petitioners
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
attorney who I believe is present today
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
makes a presentation I leave it totally
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.549 align:start position:0%
 
first

00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
um I think the petitioner oh the
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
petitioner's point is is pretty clear
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
we'd like to they just want to send it
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
electronically with the option for hard
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
copy and which we all understand so if
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
you could explain your opposition to
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
that idea C certainly uh just so it's
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
clear there's nothing under the and if
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
I'm too loud let me know because I'm not
 
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
used to using microphones um there's
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
nothing under our rules that prohibits
 
00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:46.389 align:start position:0%
nothing under our rules that prohibits
the

00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
delivery uh of the public offering
 
00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:51.389 align:start position:0%
delivery uh of the public offering
statement

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
electronically there is something in our
 
00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
rules that requires a hard
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
copy and we believe that that that is
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
fundamentally important so first off
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of convenience to
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
the consumer there is nothing that Pro
 
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:06.519 align:start position:0%
prohibits electronic delivery of a
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
public offering statement or any of the
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
other solicita documents associated with
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's perspectively entering
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
into a purchase and sales agreement
 
00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
regarding either a regulated subdivision
 
00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:22.519 align:start position:0%
or a regulated condominium the reason I
 
00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
say regulated as I'm sure the members of
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
the committee is aware not all
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
subdivisions are regulated by the bureau
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
not all Condominiums are regulated by
 
00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:32.710 align:start position:0%
not all Condominiums are regulated by
the

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
bureau depends upon whether it's
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
residential only or whether there's a
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
certain number of units
 
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
um the reason or reasons that the bureau
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
is steadfastly opposed to this proposed
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
change is
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
because the general court has given our
 
00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320 align:start position:0%
Bureau charge of protecting consumers in
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
a very
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
complicated legal mindfield area of
 
00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.549 align:start position:0%
complicated legal mindfield area of
law

00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
normally all things being equal there
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
are very few areas of New Hampshire
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
Commerce that are as
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
regulated and as prescribed
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
statutorily as land transactions
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
involving developments of subdivisions
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
all things being equal with certain
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
exceptions for fraud and the
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
transactions involving the sell of
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
Securities and certain Insurance
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
provisions and certain Provisions
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
regarding transfer of automobiles the
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
statutes by and large adopt some version
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
of caveat mtor let the buyer
 
00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
beware because of the concern that this
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
General Court had and I believe still
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
has regarding the prospect for
 
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.350 align:start position:0%
has regarding the prospect for
Consumer

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
Consumer
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
Fraud consumer
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding consumer
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
confusion and people not knowing what it
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
is they're buying when they're spending
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
thousands or hundreds of thousands of
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
dollars in purchasing what might just be
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
a one-week rental but most of the time
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
and quite often involves their home
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
place and for that reason the eneral
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
Court specified in both RSA chapter 356a
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and RSA 360 excuse me 356b
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
Condominiums mandatory requirement in
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of cases of a public
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
offering statement and the public
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
offering statement as that phrase is
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
used in both statutes is similar to the
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
concept of a perspectus whenever someone
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
is looking to invest and financi cial
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
instrument stock Bond debenture
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the statute is very clear as to
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
what has to be in those public offering
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
statements the statutes are very clear
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General's office has
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
to actually approve them and actually
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
designates the form that they should be
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
in so that you can take a public
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
offering statement from one condominium
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
and another one and although they will
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
not be identical language because the
 
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
projects will be different there will
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
there is a general format in which what
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
gets disclosed in what order all based
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
upon requirements that are contained in
 
00:33:34.279 --> 00:33:35.750 align:start position:0%
upon requirements that are contained in
the

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
statute the concern that the bureau has
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
is not to be quite honest with the
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
petitioner if Riverwalk was the only
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
entity that was developing promoting and
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
selling Condominiums and subdivisions
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire we
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need the
 
00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
regulation but Riverwalk is not the only
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
entity they are but one of hundreds of
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
entities if not thousands of entities
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
that develop promote and sell new
 
00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
condominium projects and new
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and the Condominiums again
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
can either be
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
full-time or some version of integral
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
ownership and River walks project is
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
both our concern is is that although
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
there are consumers who have computers
 
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
or other tablets of sufficient size to
 
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
be able to download and be able to
 
00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
meaningfully read and
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
review these detailed single pay lined
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
legal documents we think that is the
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
exception to the rule we already know
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
from our previous experience in the
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
bureau and again we're the agency that
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
receives most consumer complaints
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
regarding the conduct of business within
 
00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:55.270 align:start position:0%
regarding the conduct of business within
the

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:58.829 --> 00:34:58.839 align:start position:0%
state we already know that there has
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
been a plethora of problems with people
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
receiving electronic disclosures only
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
regarding important contracts and legal
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
documents we have no problem with
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
electronic disclosure we think for
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
people who want it it's great but we
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
think that everyone ought to have and
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
ought not have the ability to opt out of
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
the physical copy now I've brought for
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
committee copies of river walk's last
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
approved public offering statement not
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
the numerous documents that are attached
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
to it that would end up making it about
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
three pages thick but the actual
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
narrative description with the
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
permission of the chairman I would hand
 
00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.390 align:start position:0%
permission of the chairman I would hand
those

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
out not knowing whether all the members
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the committee have actually ever
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
condominium not all of us have
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
direct and I want to correct my letter I
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
said it was 18 Pages plus the index the
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
index is included in the 18 Pages oh
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
type this is an excellently
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
prepared and my opinion and I was not
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
the attorney who reviewed this so I'm
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
not saying I did a good job someone else
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
did a good job in approving it but
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
someone did an excellent job in writing
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
it and this public offering statement
 
00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
starts off after the cover sheet in the
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
very first page there's two statutorily
 
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.349 align:start position:0%
very first page there's two statutorily
required

00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
disclosures that our Bureau requires
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
that we implement but that the
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
legislature is required first is the
 
00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:52.359 align:start position:0%
disclosure of how important the public
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
offering statement is you will note that
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
it's in capitals and it's in bold
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
the statute authorizing public offering
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
statements does not allow variations in
 
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
the type unless the Attorney General's
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
office requires
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
it we think it's so important right up
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
front for people to know this document
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
is the big
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
cheese you better read this as carefully
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
if not more carefully than the purchase
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
and sales agreement because most of the
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
time with the purchase and sales
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
agreement it's what's the price when's
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
the closing and what are the add-ons and
 
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
then a whole lot of other stuff that can
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
become important but most of the time
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
aren't but everything involving a
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
condominium is complicated it is a
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
pickup stick for those of you who are
 
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
old enough to remember that game of
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
legal rights and are very complicated
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
and no two Condominiums are created
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
equally or the
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
same the actual operation of a
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
condominium varies greatly and
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
significantly from one condominium
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
project to the to the other between
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for what what are the
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
common areas those are the areas that
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
are owned jointly what are the limited
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
common areas who's responsible for
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
maintaining them what things can be done
 
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
on them the purpose of the disclosure
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
statement is so that people can
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
understand for the particular
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
condominium they're looking and
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
purchasing and spending thousands of
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
dollars on if not hundreds of thousands
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
of dollars what they're
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
getting our concern is is that from our
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
experience already particularly in
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
automobile sales and other items where
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
there's often sales that have been
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
moving towards electronic primary or
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
often electronic
 
00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
only transmission is that it is far too
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
easy for even the well- intending
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
consumer to
 
00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
receive an electronic bundle that's
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
going to have these 18 Pages plus the
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pages of attach M
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
ments on their cell
 
00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
phone and I've seen this happen when
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
I've been at automobile dealers buying
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
cars myself or when I in my prior prior
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
Private Practice represented automobile
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
dealers see people reading a 10 or 12
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
page very detailed retail installment
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
contract or attempting to read it by
 
00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
scrolling and in
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
terbly after they get the name and they
 
00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:31.640 align:start position:0%
check the price the next thing they do
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
is where is the the place where I say
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
I've signed it and I initial
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
it in my private practice and I was a
 
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
long-term attorney I have difficulty
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
seeing Justice Lynn without a black Rob
 
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.230 align:start position:0%
seeing Justice Lynn without a black Rob
on

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
so it took me a while to be realizing
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
that I could actually sit down um but
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
but I've seen this in my own private
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
practice practice where people bought
 
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
things and they were told hey yeah
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
that's the legal mumbo jumbo it's not
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
important and they sign it and once
 
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
they've signed it
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
electronically once they've said yes
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
there is a five-day ride of recision by
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
Statute for Condominiums and regulated
 
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
land cells but the five-day ride of
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
recision is only meaningful if you know
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
you need to look into what it is you
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
said yes to and if you've been convinced
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
either by your own unfortunately
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
laziness or busyness or you don't have
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
good access to a computer like the
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
transcriptionist has to where you can
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
actually read
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
it and come back to it then we're making
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
a mockery of protecting
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
consumers this will never be a concern
 
00:40:48.839 --> 00:40:50.589 align:start position:0%
consumers this will never be a concern
with

00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
Riverwalk if as I said earlier and I
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
meant it if the people who operate river
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
rock or if everyone in the condominium
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
industry was of the same caliber we
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need regulation but I can tell
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
you we know that that's just not
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
true we receive complaints regularly
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
regarding concerns regarding what's
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
going on in condominium units I know the
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
board the the legislature is aware
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
there's several bills right now one
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
involving the possibility of
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
adopting establishing a board to deal
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
with condominium disputes between unit
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
boards we just think it is a mistake if
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to be serious about
 
00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.910 align:start position:0%
we're going to be serious about
protecting

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
00:41:39.069 --> 00:41:39.079 align:start position:0%
people in a very detailed complicated
 
00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:42.109 align:start position:0%
people in a very detailed complicated
legal

00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
transaction by encouraging them or
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
allowing them to do electronic
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
only there's nothing that prevents this
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
developer or any other developer from
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
making electronic disclosure of
 
00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
everything so long as the consumer
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
conser still gets a hard copy of their
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
purchase and sales agreement and of
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
statement even the public offering
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
statement says how important it is to
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
read it all the way through suggest
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
making sure you understand the
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
attachments and recommends talking to an
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
attorney because these are hundreds of
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars of transactions per
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
consumer typically
 
00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
and once you've said yes unless you
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
realize there's a problem within the
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
5-day recision period you're stuck
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
whether you understood or
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
not so if our Bureau is going to
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
actually live up to its name consumer
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
protection if we're going to follow the
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
Mandate that the legislature gave us in
 
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
both statute to enforce and administer
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
for the protection of the
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
consumers the
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
statutes we believe that there still
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be inhand delivery we don't
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
care if it's by mail we don't care how
 
00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:06.950 align:start position:0%
care if it's by mail we don't care how
it

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
is now some people will say well that
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
time real estate transactions seldom
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
close that quickly so it's not that much
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
more time for
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
delivery it amazes me that there is this
 
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
thing called ups that has overnight
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
delivery and it works very
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
well I know I've been using it for 30
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
practice most but not all of these
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
transactions involve some FaceTime
 
00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
between with the
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
consumer so we just don't get how it
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
will be so burdensome on either
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
consumers or developers to continue to
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
require what our regulations have
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
required since the very first passage of
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
both of these statutes if committee
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
members have any questions I would be
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
glad to attempt to answer them and if we
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
need a translator perhaps we can get
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
someone to help me because I'm from
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
Southwest New
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senator L you had a question
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
yeah just a couple questions so is is
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
there an a specific statute that says it
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
has to be hard copy or is that just
 
00:44:18.599 --> 00:44:19.670 align:start position:0%
has to be hard copy or is that just
administrative

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
rules that's just in our regulations the
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
statute merely says it has to be
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
delivered when both stat statutes were
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
written there was no such thing as
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
electronic delivery unless you were the
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
government um or very wealthy
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
corporations follow follow so again
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
given the Advent of technology and
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
everything you can do with technology
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
being a technologist myself yeah things
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
like docy sign you can make them initial
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
every single page to make sure they've
 
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
seen it and adopted it and readed it and
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
and keep that as a transaction to show
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
that the consumer or the person who who
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
signing the docy sign document um read
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
everything or at least initialing the
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
page saying they've looked at it why
 
00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
would that actually I think that would
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
probably be a better consumer protection
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
because you mail somebody a document you
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
have no no idea if it went straight in a
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
trash can or if they actually looked at
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
it where with an electronic means you
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
can actually require that every page
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
gets an initial and that both both
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
parties know that they initialed it um
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be a better consumer
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
protection than just mailing and firing
 
00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.870 align:start position:0%
protection than just mailing and firing
and

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
forgetting I was
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
confident I even thought it was more
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
likely than not that the mere fact that
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
someone has to push the initial button
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
on a doc assign document on whether it's
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
one page or every page I would say yes I
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
know from my experience as a private
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
attorney and I know based upon the
 
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
experience being at the bureau and the
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
complaints received that unfortunately a
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
lot of people stop reading after about
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
the first second page when they're doing
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
electronically technologist people are
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
used to using computers people who have
 
00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.549 align:start position:0%
used to using computers people who have
full-size

00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:03.559 align:start position:0%
full-size
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
screens May well be a horse of different
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
color as they said in the Wizard of ox
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
we have to
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
regulate not because we have no ability
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
to distinguish
 
00:46:16.549 --> 00:46:16.559 align:start position:0%
between the
 
00:46:16.559 --> 00:46:18.950 align:start position:0%
between the
honorable

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
honorable
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
intelligent scrupulous developer like
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
Riverwalk and others we s similar do not
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
have the ability to write regulations
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
for sophisticated
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
Savvy consumers who are used to using
 
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
computers for legal documents and are
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
used to reviewing legal documents as
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to those who I can't be bothered
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
now someone could say well what about
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
that we can't help people who won't help
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
themselves we shouldn't create a system
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
where it's easy for people to not know
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
what doing and buying and selling a
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
condominium most importantly in this
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
case buying a condominium in a new
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
development because the this all has to
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
do with new
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
developments is not something that most
 
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
people are familiar with and it is
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
fraught with legal problems and
 
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
financial problems I know this because I
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
used to do it in private practice I know
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
this because since I've been at the
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
bureau because of my previous experience
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
I've been doing a lot of condominium
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
work and unfortunately a lot of it's not
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
just been
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
regulation approval of new Condominiums
 
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of it has been workouts and
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
problems with condominiums that e have
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
either gone South or are going south or
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
are having major disputes with the
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association because what was
 
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
promised Le verbally doesn't appear to
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
be what the reality is that's why we
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
think a hard copy is the best way to go
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but I I don't know how we
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
could come up with
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
words or regulation would allow us
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
distinguish between the informed
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
consumer and The Savvy consumer a
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle of consumer
 
00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.200 align:start position:0%
protection work both on a state level
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
and a federal level is that we look at
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
the typical and average consumer in
 
00:48:20.079 --> 00:48:22.109 align:start position:0%
the typical and average consumer in
adopting

00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
adopting
 
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:24.760 align:start position:0%
regulations for that reason we think
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
that re requiring the hard copy is
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
important no one has to use
 
00:48:34.589 --> 00:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
it follow follow so again I I guess my
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
question comes around right now I'm
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
assuming if they send it by mail there's
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
some all they do is they get a return
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
receipt the person sign for it but you
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
have no no idea whether they actually
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
opened it or threw it in the trash can
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
none it is no consumer protection around
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
that just the the the Riverwalk in this
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
case would just say oh no we sent it
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
here's my verification and that was it
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
it would just be the green return from
 
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
the from the post office correct the
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
process is that the bureau will never
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
know unless there's a dispute the the
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
the developer is required to keep a copy
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the signed
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement the bureau that green
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
receipt from the post office no the
 
00:49:17.549 --> 00:49:17.559 align:start position:0%
actual the the public offering statement
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
actually includes an acknowledgment of
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
receipt and and that's included on on
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
all um public offering statements now
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
some some developers do do the initial
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of the page things um we
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
don't require
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
that we take people at their word if
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
they if they said they got it they got
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
it we can't make them read it we can
 
00:49:46.829 --> 00:49:46.839 align:start position:0%
encourage it make sure it says it on the
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
first page and it says it more than one
 
00:49:50.589 --> 00:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
place in it that it should be read all
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
the information that we have regarding
 
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
condominiums on our website and we have
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
very ious places for informed consumers
 
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
to look and see you know what you should
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
look into things to be aware of we
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
always say read the public offering
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
statement if you do nothing else um but
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
we can't make anyone do
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
thatone else have a question concern
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
representative Leon and then
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid thank you madam
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for coming with all
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
this knowledge of this um one of my
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
other con questions and concerns is
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
around what's going to happen with
 
00:50:26.109 --> 00:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
somebody um if they pass away and it's
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
only on their computer that nobody can
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
access and what their errors will do
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
with the paper copy I mean obviously we
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
can't say that the person will file it
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
in a real file cabinet instead of the
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
circular file but it gives a I would
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
think that it would that would give a
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
greater likelihood that there will be a
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
copy available to those who survive the
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
one who's
 
00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
Contracting I'm somewhat of a
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
neanderthal on this point so I will
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
readily acknowledge that if I was
 
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
receiving something electronically only
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
and if I was receiving on my personal
 
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
device as opposed to my work device
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
where I have a meaningful file system
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
even if it was still on the device it
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
would probably be not particularly
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
readily accessible after
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
about three months more or less six
 
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
months or a
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
year but I may be behind the learning
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
curve on that because I still hand my
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
cell phone to my children whenever I
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
want to learn how to do something
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
new representative Schmidt you had a had
 
00:51:23.319 --> 00:51:23.990 align:start position:0%
new representative Schmidt you had a had
a

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
question well it's a small matter but
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
you're not only being recorded you're
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
being videotaped and you're operating
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
under false pretenses because the S sign
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
in front of you references your your
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
colleague who was before us about half
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
an hour he's smarter and better looking
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
than I am
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
too I won't comment on either one of
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
those but you have a question
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative the question was whether
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
he would like to remove that since he's
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
being recorded
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
ah we he answered it any other questions
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
Senator GR um I I think we have a case
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
here where we've got the statute and
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
we're kind of being asked to do
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee work okay on the thing what
 
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
what we need happen is
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
for our our staff uh to tell us where we
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
are and if a legislative fix is needed
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know have the department work with
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature of their choice to get
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
this done so it it seems to me that the
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of interpretation of
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
delivery of documents
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
and the agency has interpreted it in one
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
particular way and some stakeholder
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
disagrees with that interpretation
 
00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.750 align:start position:0%
disagrees with that interpretation
that's

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
it's Madam chairman if I could just
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
briefly interject on that point although
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
we do believe the committee should
 
00:52:50.789 --> 00:52:50.799 align:start position:0%
reject this petion and deny it we have
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
suggested in our letter that the if if
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
the committee is thinking that it might
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
move favorably on the petition we have
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
requested pursuant to the administrative
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
procedures act in our letter that this
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
committee consider making a referral to
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee which normally
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
handles condominium matters and there's
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
also a special committee that is formed
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
under RSA 356b colon 70 and do uh
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
regarding legislative and Regulatory
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
matters for condominium we've suggested
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
that if this committee
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
is tending positive regarding the
 
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
petition that perhaps it would be
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have the expertise of
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
those committees but we leave that to
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
the Defence of the commit here
 
00:53:34.829 --> 00:53:34.839 align:start position:0%
representative ly yeah so I was just
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
going to say um I I'm assuming that that
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
um the the there's a representative here
 
00:53:45.069 --> 00:53:45.079 align:start position:0%
who brought the petition um and I I mean
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
so I assume we're going to hear from
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
that person I guess what I the only
 
00:53:50.589 --> 00:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
comment I would make is obviously I want
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
to I think we all would want to hear
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
what the what
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
the the prop opponent of this change is
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
but my only my only comment uh is I I
 
00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
think you've made a very persuasive
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
argument the only the only comment I
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
would make is you know if the my sense
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
is if this that rep that what Senator
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
Lang um suggested um I think is I think
 
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
is it's a it's a his point is very well
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
taken the problem I have is that I think
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
you know if you were proposing if the
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
partitioners were proposing this change
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
10 years from now 10 years in the future
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it would make more sense but my
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
sense is that you really are right on in
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the way people nowadays
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
including you know neanderthals like of
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
my age uh who you know deal with
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
electronic things I think we are much
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
more careful um in dealing with things
 
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
that are hard copies than than we do
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
things that are done electronically and
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it's limited to people
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
that are my age but certainly it it uh
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's true of people that are you know
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
probably over 50 or 60 um and so for
 
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
those reasons I I think we should not
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
make any change I think your your
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
position is very well
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
taken okay director moral um early in
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
the testimony from uh assistant AG Davis
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
he indicated that there was no
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
prohibition to have an electronic copy
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
in addition to the uh hard copy um you
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
have a two-page attachment that contains
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
the current Jus rule rules on this uh
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
both on the first page in
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
130701 and on the second page in
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
140601 um it indic it specifies how this
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
is done and the requirements for uh
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
submitting this um I don't disagree that
 
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps an entity could get an
 
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:51.559 align:start position:0%
electronic copy but I do not believe
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
from reading this and I've read it
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
carefully that a read would understand
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
available uh paragraph C does talk about
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
a waiver but that waiver is only as to
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
paper just for clarification I I don't
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
want to suggest that the regulation says
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
and oh by the way you can send an
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
electronic copy but they can because
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing prohibits it no it
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
happens occasionally we have developers
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
who say we want to do this as part of
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
our marketing is is this okay and I'll
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
say yes and I'll say I'll give you an
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
email so you don't have to worry about
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
it but I know I can represent to the
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
committee that a lot of declarants
 
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
transmit the documents that way but they
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
still make sure that the public offering
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
statement and the purchase and sales
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
agreement there's a hard well actually
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
we don't require a hard copy on the
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
purchase sales agreement but they often
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
do them together
 
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
because they have co- receipts on them
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
yes I I think
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
that if I were reading this I would not
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
take a electronic delivery as an option
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
or even uh something that could be done
 
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:04.039 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
would I would request that you revise
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
the rule to say that for information
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
only you could a an electronic copy is
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
is allowable and even
 
00:57:19.109 --> 00:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
encouraged I don't think that have
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
authority to say that I know we could do
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
that but I have authority to be able to
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
tell you I could well imagine that as
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
part of our next Ru making we would be
 
00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
doing that but I can tell the committee
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
right now I know it happens without even
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
being asked every time I get the
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
question from a declarant that's the
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
person who's doing the de the uh
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
condominium attorney I say oh yeah of
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
course do you want an email just so you
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
know but yeah I mean I I agree with you
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think we want people trying to
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
read this thing on their phones uh I'd
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
go blind but um
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
but the electronic
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
form you know can be can be used and and
 
00:58:05.309 --> 00:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
then you just keep the hard copy in your
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
paper files which are probably less
 
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
voluminous than your computer files
 
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
these days and and just so it's clear to
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
the extent that I haven't been Bureau
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
has no concern with electronic delivery
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
of important documents Our concern
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
is this particular document the public
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
offering statement is really
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
the be all of the be's needs regarding
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
what you need to know at a minimum
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
before you invest your money and our
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
concern is is electronic
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
only clarification yes so clar
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying on that so if someone like
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
Riverwalk wanted to do they could send
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
out the hard copy could they also send
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
out a digital copy they get a digital
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
signature and if they got the digital
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
signature would meet the needs of the a
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:00.190 align:start position:0%
of the
organization

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
that I have to look at the comparison of
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
our electronic signature
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
statue and our
 
00:59:15.069 --> 00:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
regulations I can't answer the question
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure how they coales
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
right now we would have no problem with
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
conceptually unless it's in our regs
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm not aware of and I don't think
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
it is we don't have a problem with
 
00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.230 align:start position:0%
it is we don't have a problem with
electronic

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
signatures purchase and sales agreements
 
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.470 align:start position:0%
signatures purchase and sales agreements
on

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
condominium uh purchases are often done
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
electronically our problem Our concern
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
is is that the consumer not have a hard
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
copy of the purchase and sales agreement
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
again we acknowledge they may read it or
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
may not but but we think that the
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
likelihood that they read it were at
 
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
least skim it enough to where they oh I
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
ought to know about that is greater if
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
it's in paper than if it's
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
electronically across the board no for
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
every consumer absolutely not some won't
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
read and some will read the electronic
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
excellent last followup so again again
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
the compromise is it could be both so
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
you could use a hard copy to meet the
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
requirement of sending a hard copy but
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
get the signature digitally um through
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
another another means that has the same
 
01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.870 align:start position:0%
another another means that has the same
exact

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
exact
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
document yes and I think that might be
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
happening now it just the reason I say
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
it might be happening now the way this
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
process works just from a practical
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
standpoint is Riverwalk comes in there
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's the brand new project or
 
01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
they're adding units or adding they have
 
01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
a proposal we review the new P public
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
offering statement as you can see on the
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
one that I that I sent you you know this
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
has been edited over time as they as
 
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
their project has changed we approve it
 
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
they have to use
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
it we never know
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
what's happening unless there's a
 
01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:59.349 align:start position:0%
what's happening unless there's a
complaint

01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:01.309 align:start position:0%
complaint
file

01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
file
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
so as a practical matter I know that
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of developers who do
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
electronic signatures I'm assuming
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
they're doing them on both the per the
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
purchase of sales agreement and the
 
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
public offering statement but I don't
 
01:01:16.349 --> 01:01:16.359 align:start position:0%
know that for a fact because we only
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
find out about these things whenever
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%
there's a problem I haven't heard of a
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
problem with people saying I didn't sign
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
the document I have had problems we have
 
01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:26.039 align:start position:0%
had problems problems not just J.R Davis
 
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
the bureau has had problems with
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
consumers saying I signed stuff
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
electronically and I didn't realize what
 
01:01:34.829 --> 01:01:34.839 align:start position:0%
was in it but both in the condominium
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
world in the automobile world and in a
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
whole host of other ones but the
 
01:01:41.309 --> 01:01:41.319 align:start position:0%
automobiles are the one we see the most
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
because that's one of the industries
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
that certain dealerships it's nearly
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
it's very problematic to get anything in
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
paper previous to signing okay
 
01:01:54.910 --> 01:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips thank you
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
thanks Madam chair I um could not agree
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
more with u Mr Davis about this matter
 
01:02:02.829 --> 01:02:02.839 align:start position:0%
as a practicing attorney in this
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
specific field I've represented both
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
developers senior citizens who have sold
 
01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
and purchased Condominiums and I've also
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
handled some litigation over condominium
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
um enforcement of bylaws so um I think
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
that this paper copy is critical I think
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
especially with the generation folks who
 
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
do not have computers do not have email
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
addresses do not use electronic means of
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
communications other than telephones you
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
know landlines so I think it there are
 
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
still people in our state who absolutely
 
01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:34.359 align:start position:0%
require paper copies
 
01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:38.039 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you um also the industry
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
is also making use of electronic data um
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
communication and you know but with the
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
agreement up front that they're willing
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
to do the docy sign situation but it
 
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent I mean the developers
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
are still required to send this
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
documentation which is a minimal
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
expenditure for these folks who are
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
already deep in the woods you know
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
trying to invest these you know get
 
01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:02.039 align:start position:0%
these Investments out and out the door
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
make money on their project so um I'm
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
sure that the representative here who is
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
going to talk on behalf of Lon Mountain
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
LLC will make mention of the expenditure
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
that they're probably trying to avoid by
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
having this electronic means but um I
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
think you know it's a minor
 
01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
inconvenience for the seller and I think
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
it's important to maintain for Consumer
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
Protections so I would like to just go
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
ahead and make a motion to decline the
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
the petition I think it's
 
01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary okay is there a second that
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
motion second by Senator
 
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
Ward any Madam chair yes we do have a
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh for the petitioner
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
present yes we're going to deny it
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
coming yes that's a good point M Madam
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
chairman before before we go to the next
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
part just one thing the you you made a
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
suggestion about us thinking about
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
amending our rule one thing that I do
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
let need to let the committee KN know is
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
when I go back to my chief and we talk
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
about this one thing we will have to
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
think through is
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
timing because the statute says that the
 
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
five Day statutory right of recision is
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
based upon the latter of the signature
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
of the purchase and sales agreement or
 
01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.950 align:start position:0%
of the purchase and sales agreement or
the

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
delivery of the um public offering
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
statement and so if we had different
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
deliveries electronically on one date
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
delivery by hand on another date I don't
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
want to get into a situation where I've
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
created a statutory ambiguity so we in
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
the process of doing that it would
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
probably be a situation where we'd have
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
to have the timing be for whatever the
 
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
loudest of those three dates were unless
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment to the statute
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's a I just didn't
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
want to create a you know we don't
 
01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
either um if you could let the
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.349 align:start position:0%
 
petitioner

01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
petitioner
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
morning I appreciate your time thank you
 
01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:15.799 align:start position:0%

the table so I'll be brief I know that
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
attorney uh good morning Caroline

Leonard uh I'm attorney with Gallagher

Calahan garell and I'm here on behalf of
 
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
my client Riverwalk at Lon Mountain
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
LLC I have with me this giant stack of
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
documents I know you guys all just
 
01:05:34.589 --> 01:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
received thank you attorney Davis uh the
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
18-page narrative summary of the public
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
offering statement but what attorney
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
Davis mentioned but I wanted to give you
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
the actual visual is this is the entire
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
public offering statement under the
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
statute for both the land sale
 
01:05:51.069 --> 01:05:51.079 align:start position:0%
disclosures Act and the Condominium Act
 
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
which governs subdivisions and
 
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
condominium sales we are required
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
developers are required to include a lot
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
of different things as attorney Davis
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
alluded to in this document this is how
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
big it is 47 Pages um that's not to say
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
every Resort has something this
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
extensive Riverwalk is a more
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
complicated Resort in my opinion um but
 
01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to give you guys a flavor
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
for this is what we're talking about um
 
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
every single consumer needs to receive
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
all of this not just the 18 Pages
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
attorney Davis shared with you all of
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
this and these include the statutorily
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
required components so to touch on an
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
earlier point about this notion of
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
whether we go in the legislative
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
direction of amending a bill or creating
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
a bill or if we are here during our
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
regulatory phase this aspect requiring
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
physical paper delivery is mandated
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
through the regulations it's not part of
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
the statute as such I would encourage
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
the committee to address this in its
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
opice under its opes as the ability to
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
effectuate rule changing um I want to
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit lay of the land as
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
far as how these are done in other
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions um I also have the
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
pleasure of representing uh the American
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
Resort Development Association Arda they
 
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
are an association as the name is
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
suggest of various different um
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
developers around the country of resorts
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
I've been working with them on this in
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
addition to our client Riverwalk and
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
they shared with me that in every major
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
State around the country that sells
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
times share condominium they permit
 
01:07:34.589 --> 01:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
electronic delivery we are behind the
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
times in New Hampshire and I really
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
think to touch on Senator Lang's point
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
this we could very readily accomplish a
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
protective mechanism that permitted both
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
electronic or paper delivery and if you
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
read our suggested change that's
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
actually what we're proposing we're not
 
01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
suggesting only electronic we're
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
suggesting give the consumer the choice
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
if the consumer feels I'm not
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable reading something this big
 
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
in electronic form I'd really like a
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
paper copy great we will provide you one
 
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:09.880 align:start position:0%
free of charge no problem we can build
 
01:08:12.029 --> 01:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
to that end but right now the regulation
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
does not allow that it dictates mandates
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
paper only I say let the consumer decide
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
we don't need to be paternalistic we
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't need to make this choice for the
 
01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.749 align:start position:0%
don't need to make this choice for the
consumer

01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
you all know the benefits of electronic
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
delivery you can search you can do
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
contrl F if you want to find a specific
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
section on say dos if I have to hunt
 
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
through this physical copy that's going
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
to take me ages if I can just do a
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
search quickly with my keyboard I'm much
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
more likely to find that quickly um you
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
all know the the ability if you wanted
 
01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
to increase the font size if you wanted
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
for example to translate the document if
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
English might not be your first language
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
there are a host of different reasons
 
01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
why electronic really affords the
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
consumer I think more protection I say
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
give the consumers the choice um our
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
revised language we hope strikes this
 
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
balance between
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
efficiency better protection and an
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
ability to if a consumer wants it they
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
can still have paper we're not disputing
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
that if somebody wants paper they can
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
have it um and I believe I heard a
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
question earlier about uh if somebody
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to review the actual document in
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
physical form the statute actually
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
already mandates that a resort always
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
keep a desk copy of the current
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
iteration of the public offering
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
statement on site so I I think
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
representative Leon it was your question
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
as to an heir if if for example a
 
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
beneficiary or a relative uh knew that
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
their parent or the deceased had had
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
ownership at a particular Resort they
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
could easily contact the resort and
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
again I know I can only speak to my
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
developer clients but um we are very
 
01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
happy to always accommodate such a
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
request um we can send it electronically
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
but we always by by law we are required
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
to keep a copy of this document at all
 
01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
times at the front desk so if that helps
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
alleviate concerns I wanted to make sure
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
we hit that as well I'm happy to answer
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
any questions okay thank you are there
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Lynn I
 
01:10:13.229 --> 01:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could tell us that you
 
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
said that that the the for this
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
condominium it's 400 Pages or something
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
could you give us some idea of I assume
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
you've represented other condominium
 
01:10:25.149 --> 01:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
Developers of sort of the average is
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
that what the average uh documentation
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
is your honor I'm going I'm apologize
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
for calling you your honor I'm still
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
going to tab it um uh I'm GNA give you
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
the lawyer answer it really depends um
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
it depends on the type of product
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
they're selling um if for example
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
they're only selling Whole condominium
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
units it might be a little bit shorter
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
if for example like this Resort they're
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
selling interval interests meaning
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
somebody could own for a week somebody
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
could own for a few months uh that
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
requires additional paperwork because
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
you have to provide each type of
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
ownership's corresponding paperwork
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's a very long answer to your
 
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the information
 
01:11:13.719 --> 01:11:15.030 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the information
appreciate

01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
it so we have a motion to deny the
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
petition the the request for a petition
 
01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.070 align:start position:0%
petition the the request for a petition
is

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
any further comments questions concerns
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative Lon um thank you madam
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that this is a more
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
complex issue and I'm I'm thinking it
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
may make sense to deny the petition and
 
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
go through the legislative process and
 
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I missed any comments to
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
the to the similar when I needed to run
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
out for a
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
moment yes I would believe if
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative hacket Phillips wishes to
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
amend her um her motion to include a
 
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:51.280 align:start position:0%
reference to the
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
legislature I would certainly I hope
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
that we could accept that the committee
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
is feeling that way that's fine with
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
me I I'll second the amended motion okay
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
comments okay those in favor of denying
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
the request for petition and referring
 
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
it to the legislature say I I I those
 
01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.870 align:start position:0%
