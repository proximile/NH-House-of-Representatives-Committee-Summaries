47 z uh after a brief discussion with my

clerk we're going to decide that we will
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
go for a vote today so I'd like to have
 
00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any information that
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
they'd like to speak about uh you
 
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.390 align:start position:0%
they'd like to speak about uh you
certainly

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.909 align:start position:0%
certainly
can

00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
repr thatal we all knew it was coming
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair um and so I
 
00:18:08.909 --> 00:18:08.919 align:start position:0%
I think that this is a wonderful bill I
 
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
think that it has been uh vetted fully
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
in the full committee uh we recently
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
passed the um legalization of strictly
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
testing and analy well strictly uh fenal
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
and xylazine test stps that's a
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
wonderful start what this does is this
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
really uh it fully fleshes out how we
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
can actually analyze or set up a
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
structure so that we can analyze uh and
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
know what's on our streets um and so
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
this goes a little bit further in the
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
way that it allows us to have more
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
accurate information um feny and
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
xylazine test strips um you know I use
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
the comparison to like a pregnancy test
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
but that's what it is you either are or
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
you aren't you know it either exists or
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't but it doesn't tell you how
 
00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:54.200 align:start position:0%
much it doesn't allow you to test for
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
multiple substances etc etc and so what
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
this does is allows us to have better
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
information which ultimately not only um
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
you know in the personal way that uh
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
fenel and xylazine test strips Empower
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
individuals to be able to make better
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
decisions about um you know whether or
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
not they want to use substances or not
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
um what this does is this empowers us as
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
a community to be able to better Target
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
and better better address um the things
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
that are creeping into our uh uh elicit
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
drug Supply and so I think that this
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
honestly can be nothing nothing but good
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
um from you know from all angles and so
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very supportive of this bill if
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
you don't know that yet and uh thank you
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
for letting me
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
speak yeah we we also we have an
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
amendment that was proposed it was
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
discussed the last time around and I
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
think this was something that made it a
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
little more palatable across the board
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
it was kind of a a compromise thing so
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
we do have this amendment here but we
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
never voted on it it is uh amendment
 
00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:57.230 align:start position:0%
never voted on it it is uh amendment
number

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
515 um from February 14th 2023 when we
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
went to Executive session this was
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
available but we decided to retain it
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
instead um so you know I'm I'm happy to
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
uh pass that amendment I think that you
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
know they were they were good changes
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
that um that made it so that more people
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
on the committee and uh hopefully more
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
people in the broader house and in the
 
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
Senate um are more amendable to passing
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
this bill it's it's people are more
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it with with the
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
amendment so happy to to make a motion
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
to pass that make a motion to pass that
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh whatever you choose to to
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
do today chair uh thank you
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative uh represent Reed yes
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so the way I read
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
this um we pass the fentanyl test strips
 
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
um as a harm reduction tool makes
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
complete sense and of course we want to
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
minimize overdose deaths and we want to
 
00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
provide people with the tools necessary
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
to determine if their drugs uh contain
 
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
fanal or siline however this bill is um
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
very very Broad and I have an issue with
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
um the drug par um drug paraphernalia
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
shall not include drug checking
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
equipment or processing preparing
 
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
packaging repackaging storing or
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
containing nominal amounts for the
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of drug checking and the amount
 
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
that is considered a nominal amount is
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
um not more than 10 milligrams so
 
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here is that people
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
can walk around with drug uh with uh uh
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
IL illegal substances less than 10
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
milligrams which is a lot and um we can
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
no longer um uh consider those um
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
previous stated um paraphernalia as
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia I do not see that as a
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
harm reduction tool I see that as an
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
enabling and very broad um I feel that
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
um this that number nine is too broad
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
and is more enabling than risk reduction
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
I am going to have to be an itl on this
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
um you know uh I just feel that again
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is not helping our our substance
 
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.470 align:start position:0%
this is not helping our our substance
misuse

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
misuse
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
um clients patients I see this as
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
enabling in no way is this going to help
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
them in their Journey um if anything
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to lead to their demise so um
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
itl thank you representative represent
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
n thank you um the the one thing that I
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
really wanted to clarify and I know it
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
was clarified when we were discussing it
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
before um but when we talk about 10
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
milligrams I think a lot of us think in
 
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
terms of like you know Tylenol or
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
something that we would get there's a
 
00:22:58.269 --> 00:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
difference between if it's uh by weight
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
or by by volume and so when it's talking
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
about 10 milligrams it's not talking
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
about you know something that you know
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
we would get in the drug store and and
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
understand that that's that what they
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
say is it's um Lincoln on the head of a
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
penny so it's it's really it's a very
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
very small amount but um and so I I did
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that but um but the
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
other thing that I wanted to kind of
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
Broach here um so in one of the things
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
that we got one of the um letters in
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
support that we got um forget what
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
organization I think it was r street
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's anyway um so in one of the
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
letters that we got there was you know
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a list of references and I went
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
write down of course I read through all
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
the references good that's fun um you
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
know studies and and things there was
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
one um this is uh New Hampshire drug
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
monitoring initiative um through DHHS
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
and um or information analysis Center so
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
anyway so what this
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
does um New Hampshire drug monitoring
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
initiative is a holistic strategy to
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
provide awareness and combat drug
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
distribution and misuse in line with
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
this approach the DMI will obtain data
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
data from various sources to include but
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
not limited to public health law
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement and EMS and provide monthly
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
products for stakeholders as well as
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
substantial awareness and releases as
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
needed so that one that was that was
 
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
referenced in um in the bottom of that
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
letter because this was in you know
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
February or March or whatever it was um
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
this was up until October of 2022 so of
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
course I went and I looked it up and
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
found the more accurate or the more
 
00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
updated one um not only you know I think
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're all pretty aware that overdose uh
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
deaths are are once again Rising um
 
00:24:37.389 --> 00:24:37.399 align:start position:0%
substantially say it's back to 2016
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
levels um um 11.5% increase um in drug
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
overdoses and um that was from 20 uh 22
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
you know in comparison to 2021 and then
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's up 10% higher um this time around
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
in 2023 so um just kind of that as a
 
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
baseline but what what's interesting
 
00:25:00.029 --> 00:25:00.039 align:start position:0%
that I found in this information really
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
caught my eye was that one of the things
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
that actually went down it says EMS
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
Naran Administration incidents and so um
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
you know I I guess you you'd really need
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
to dig into the correlation of of why
 
00:25:13.549 --> 00:25:13.559 align:start position:0%
this is right but but one of the things
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
that really sticks out to me is that
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
we've made Narcan available um broadly
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
so that we are giving it out we are
 
00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
educating people about it and that's
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
great that is a harm harm reduction tool
 
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
so we've we've intentionally gone out of
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
the way to put way more Naran um out for
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
personal use and taught people how to
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
use it and when they need to use it and
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
so it's happening more on an individual
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
level an individual saving uh another
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
person's life rather than having to call
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
emergency services and have them come
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
out that's a whole lot of economic uh
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
you know in Impact uh in that way but
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
also um if we if we kind of draw the
 
00:25:54.549 --> 00:25:54.559 align:start position:0%
parallels here it's wonderful that the
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
EMS doesn't have to come out and that
 
00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
you know but we will have less
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
information um as uh as a result because
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
EMS is not the EMS is the people who are
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
keeping the record so we're going to
 
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
have less information on how many
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
overdoses were reversed right so the
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
only reason I I call this out is because
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
I feel like there is um an analogy here
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
to the way that um you know it it's
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful that now people can test their
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
own Supply and things like that but we
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
are going to have less accurate numbers
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
because people are doing that in
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
individually rather than where it is
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
normally found out which would be you
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
know in a police interaction or
 
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
something like that right or you know
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
overdose or whatever it is the police
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
are able to understand what is on our
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
streets because of police interactions
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
if individuals or just in the same way
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
that people are able to get better
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
statistics on how many um overdoses were
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
reversed because they have an
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
interaction with the EMS um in E another
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
emergency service right um
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
so I I guess the point that I'm trying
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
to get to and you can tell me if I've
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
actually made this point properly or
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
effectively is that allowing for um
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
allowing for situations where people can
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
go um easily reducing barriers without
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
having the the criminal uh punishment
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
hanging over their head to be able to go
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
and get this information equips our
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
police better they will be more informed
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
in dealing with these elicit substances
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
being in our drug Supply
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
so go thank
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
you I'm just going to interject for us
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh just for the record
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
of retired law enforcement State Police
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
uh I do want to have that harm reduction
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
and saving lives but I know firsthand
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
that there's subjects where they
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
overdose they use Naran they're good an
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
hour later the police get called back
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
they overdose they use Naran it's just a
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
vicious cycle of the adct knowing like
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
okay I can live I can live and I I can
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
live and again we don't want to see them
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
die but it seems like they're not taking
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
the steps to see and I know I'm not an
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
addict uh I can't be in an addict's mind
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
but it seems like they just keep the
 
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
Vicious Cycle over and over and over
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
again something maybe should be to them
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
to say I get to get my act straight I
 
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's a friend uh I know
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
you can speak a lot further on this but
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
I just know on my side EMS side it's the
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
Vicious Cycle of okay I'm going to take
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
as much as I can someone hopefully will
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
find me and then I get my shot I come
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
back that's my piece on that and I'll
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
have representative Reed speak okay I
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
think we're muddying the two things here
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
har or duct so the way I see it is um
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
you have your substance misuse um issues
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
so the people who are have the substance
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
um uh procure their substance I don't
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
see a lot of them testing however so say
 
00:28:52.909 --> 00:28:52.919 align:start position:0%
you have a couple and some one of the uh
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
parts of the couple's very concerned
 
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
about their significant other they may
 
00:28:58.909 --> 00:28:58.919 align:start position:0%
the thetically test to make sure their
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
partner's okay or in a group setting you
 
00:29:06.029 --> 00:29:06.039 align:start position:0%
know let's so I am fully supportive of
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
the test strip component but what we're
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
missing here um is the fact that this is
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
still an elicit activity that we should
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
not be
 
00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880 align:start position:0%
encouraging being being arrested and
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
taken out of that environment for a
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
couple days is not such a bad thing I
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
that to be an addict is to have a demon
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
on your back 24 hours a day so here
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're just like okay you know here's all
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
the stuff you need to do to continue to
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
use and maybe if you don't die before
 
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
you have um hit rock po bottom you know
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
but in jail they may become addicts in
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
jail I understand that it's not a safe
 
00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:51.519 align:start position:0%
Zone always but it is better than being
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
on the streets being enabled to
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
continually use um how many addicts
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
parents or loved ones beg for their
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
family members to be arrested so that
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
they at least know they're safe for a
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
little bit longer and here I I would as
 
00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
from a nurse I would love to see
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
everybody test use clean needles do
 
00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
their drugs in a healthy way but you
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
know that's not reality and the fact is
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
still it's an illicit activity that we
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
should not be encouraging and that's why
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
I have to still say itl I don't care
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
about statistics at this point I want in
 
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:32.440 align:start position:0%
reality we need to help them as best as
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
we can while still providing the um and
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's another thing the big drivers of
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
our crime rate is mental illness and
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
substance abuse so if we can eliminate
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
some of the substance abuse we would our
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
crime rates would would would improve as
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
well it's just we need to um look at
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
this realistically and not um through
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
Rose Colored Glasses that if
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
we pass this everything's going to be
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
Newman I'll just make an observation
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
about what what we're going to do do
 
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
here today and we're not going to pass a
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
bill today we're not going to itl a bill
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
today we're not going to do that we're
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
going to make a recommendation to the
 
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.029 align:start position:0%
going to make a recommendation to the
full

00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
committee um I've heard two objections
 
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
made one objection is that that it's not
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
a good idea because of of what you said
 
00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:31.830 align:start position:0%
a good idea because of of what you said
about

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
um that it's not a good idea so it
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
should be it so that's the whole bill
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
that that's fine the if it were down to
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
the point about the 10 milligrams my my
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
opinion about something if if you had
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
something like that and that and that's
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
the sticking point then um you don't
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
just it the bill just you fix you don't
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
do a work around you don't kill it and
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
you you would would fix that little bit
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
so so I don't know but it sounds like
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
there's the bigger problem is the one
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
should we have it should we not have it
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we're not going to
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
resolve that today we will make a
 
00:32:08.639 --> 00:32:10.350 align:start position:0%
resolve that today we will make a
recommendation

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that's all I have to say about that
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
and then there will be a bigger
 
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
discussion when whatever recommendation
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
comes out of what we do here goes to the
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee and that can happen today or
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
it can happen whenever you all decide to
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
to whether you're going to have
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
additional meetings or not you may just
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
come up with a recommendation today and
 
00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
then we'll meet again in committee thank
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative for helping
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
us newbies figure out the process uh
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative n and then representative
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
selling I just I just wanted to clarify
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
really quickly that um I am in no way
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
looking through rosecolor glasses um I
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
was the one to receive the phone call
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
when my fiance at the time and father of
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
my two children was pulled over by the
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
state police and he was then in the
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
police barracks I used to call him a big
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
strong handsome man do you want to know
 
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
what he sounded like on that phone call
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
that was the beginning of his spiral
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
downward and it did not take long for
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
him to overdose in our bathroom on the
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
other side of a closed door with my
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
one-year-old knocking on the door saying
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
da da so I am not looking through
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
rose-colored glasses what I am looking
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
through is the eyes of a mother who has
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
raised two children through stigma
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
through all of everything that happens
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
through my own grief I had my youngest
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
three weeks later clutching pictures of
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
the family that I thought we were going
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
to be welcoming into I just I I want to
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
make that point because I don't think um
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
I think sometimes we we make it very
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
simple and clearcut and I have spent 15
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
years getting to know how gray it is and
 
00:33:57.549 --> 00:33:57.559 align:start position:0%
how impactful
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily in the ways that you
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
think but in a variety of ways and um
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
one thing I would like to note is that
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
when we were talking when we are talking
 
00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
about a mental health crisis there are a
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons but one that I don't
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
think ever really gets talked about is
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have a generation of
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
people who have lost uh their authority
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
figures they have lost their parents
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
they've lost their uncles their
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
grandparents my two kids are not
 
00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
abnormal and people have grown up with
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
that um reality and during all of this
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
reality it has been illegal and it has
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
been criminalized and it's just getting
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
worse so I I don't I I apologize I'm
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
very passionate about this I don't want
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
to dominate the conversation and I
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
totally get where you're coming from
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's not you know um contentious
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I I I get that but just to to
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
kind of clarify where I'm coming from on
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative
 
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
Cel thank you
 
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
um so there are a couple things one I
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
want to Echo um representative Newman's
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
comment about you know if it's the 10
 
00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:07.720 align:start position:0%
milligrams is there an amount that makes
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
it different right is it five milligrams
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
2 milligrams whatever it is is there
 
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
some number that we could get to just on
 
00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
that part alone that might be more
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
palatable and more amendable because if
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
that's the sticking point then that's an
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
easy solve right um I also want to make
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
a point it's you know if people have
 
00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:27.950 align:start position:0%
a point it's you know if people have
addiction

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
um we we've historically called them
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
addicts but that doesn't serve to help
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
it just serves to add labels um in my
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
experience but people suffer from
 
00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
addiction and we know we can't legislate
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
our way out of
 
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
addiction we know we can't legislate our
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
way out of mental health even though our
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
our criminal justice system is the
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
biggest provider of mental health care
 
00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:50.839 align:start position:0%
in the state um it doesn't mean that
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's the way we're going to solve it
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
right by by criminalizing all of these
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
things to I was listening to a podcast
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
recently about um an organization that
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
people can call um when they're using
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
drugs alone so that there's someone on
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
the phone who knows their name and their
 
00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:10.599 align:start position:0%
address and can call 911 if they've
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
realized they've overdosed right when
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
the person if the person becomes
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
non-responsive and the particular story
 
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
that that they featured in this
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
podcast um dealt with an overdose
 
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
situation where um you know the per the
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
call recipient was able to call 911 they
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
were able to get there in time had it
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
been 1 minute later it would have been
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
too late um the EMT managed to
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
resuscitate the
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
person they went to the ER the next day
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
they called the hotline back to use
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
again and were persuaded not to because
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
of the risks of uh using the day after
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
overdosing But ultimately did go through
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
a cycle right um but they kept being in
 
00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
communication with the same person they
 
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
called the first time and ultimately the
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
person worked their own way out of their
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
demons and into rehab and into treatment
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
and is now answering those calls to help
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
others and so you know this is a a harm
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
reduction technique right of of a phone
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
call doesn't do anything to stop the
 
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
person from using it just says if you're
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
going to use call here so we can
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully stop you from dying I was
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about representative new's
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
Comon about like the statistics will go
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
down about Naran because we don't know I
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
think it sort of parallels with coid and
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
coid testing once we had at home tests
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
the numbers nationally appeared to go
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
down not because cases went down but
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
because people didn't have to report it
 
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
because you could test at home and
 
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
isolate yourself or not as you depending
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
on your choice about responsibility you
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
know um I think that what I see in this
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
is if we can keep someone who is an
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
addiction issue alive one more
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
day maybe that's the day they realize
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
okay it's time for me to get help maybe
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's not maybe it's going to take
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
them 15 more of those days maybe it's
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
going to take them 40 doses of Naran
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
before they realize maybe it's going to
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
take them when they don't even have
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
enough um space in their neck to inject
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
into because they've run out of
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere else before they realize that
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
they're you know that they've got
 
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.510 align:start position:0%
they're you know that they've got
nothing

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
left but giving someone that one more
 
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
day also gives them that one more chance
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
and and to me that that outweighs
 
00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
everything there's a a Jewish construct
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
of you know one who saves a life Saves
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
the World so if we can save a life by
 
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.190 align:start position:0%
the World so if we can save a life by
doing

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
this we might save the world so that's
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's where I'm coming from so
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful we can find some number or
 
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
some path that would be more palatable
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't support people being addicted
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
you know I want to help them become not
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
addicted I just want to help them find
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
forward thank you representative re okay
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
so no I agree but I would be feel much
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
better about all of this if we were able
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
to se separate the um substance misuse
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
versus the illicit activity what's
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
catching for me the 10 milligrams I'm
 
00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
willing to overlook because I agree I
 
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
think you know you can take that
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
minuscule amount or whatever that's
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
that's just you're not dealing with the
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
FDA measurements here you're dealing
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
with Street measurements but um the drug
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia I just can't if you're
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
going to bring your drug to get tested
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
or you have your drug to test that's
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
fine if you have your fentanyl strips
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
and you have your drugs you know test it
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
have at it my problem lies solely in the
 
00:39:39.109 --> 00:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
definition of paraphernalia because to
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
me this is enabling a illicit activity
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
shall not include if we would do away
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
with this I would feel much better and I
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
amount may ask a clarification question
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
so if I if I were to purchase my street
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
supply of illegal substances illicit
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
substances and then I want to go get it
 
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
tested to make sure it's safer for me to
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
use I'm just trying to understand
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
so um I need some way to transport it
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
with me and so what drug par I'm trying
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
to understand what with the drug
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia like what you're saying
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
would be I'm trying to just trying to
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
understand where what your language yeah
 
00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
to test your drug you have your baggie
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever it comes in you have your
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
test strip and you dip it you don't have
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
to bring it anywhere you can procure
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
your fentanyl test strips you know as
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
when you go to those um when wherever
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
you get your stuff you know you're you
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
go to those mobile or those mobile
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
clinic clinics come to you or whatever
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
or you go they know where to get their
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips so you have five or
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
seven test strips or how many ever
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
they're given to you you keep them in
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
your pocket you get your drug you test
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
it you don't you know you don't need to
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
transport it to some place to to have it
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
done that is my understanding you
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
procure your test strips you have them
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
on you um if people are going to those
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
mobile or those on-site um clinics you
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
know it's still yeah you if you have
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
drugs above 10 milligrams you know it's
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
still an illicit activity you know um so
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
yeah if you go to those places it's to
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
get it tested
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
when you get your shower your food your
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
clothes but that's not the only way to
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
do it they you could pick your if you
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
could get your extra test strips at
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
those centers to have on you to test in
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
your using site wherever you're
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
using um it doesn't mean you're
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
transporting it all over the conquered
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
to get tested okay that's my
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
understanding yeah maybe I'm misreading
 
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
because my my understanding is that
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
essentially we're saying just that we're
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
excluding from the definition of drug
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
parapan pelia the testing equipment and
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
the and and that may be more than just
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
fenal test strips they may be other
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
types of testing equipment so maybe I'm
 
00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
misreading so if you could point to me
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
where I should be reading I'd appreciate
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
it um line nine under the drug
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia they want to do away with
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
the defin they want to take these words
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
out of the definition of paraphernalia
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
they want it to to um paraphernal you
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
not to include drug but we've already
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
said okay to fentanyl test strips but
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment are processing
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
preparing packaging repackaging storing
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
containing you know so they want to take
 
00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559 align:start position:0%
so I don't even know what would be left
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
under paraphernalia if you took all of
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
those words out of the
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
definition um but the drug I don't know
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
what other things they use to test drugs
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
I think there's little kits that like
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
for cocaine and stuff I we haven't
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
okayed that we're just you know we're we
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
passed the Fentanyl and the
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
sosine um but I just think that this
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
definition is too broad and um again
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know it's not a harm
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
ruction it's just taken it away from the
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you just in my former law
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement life uh looking at the
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
amended portion where it says shall not
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
include drug checking equipment or
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
processing I have no problem with that
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
next line preparing packaging
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
repackaging storing because again
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's an ore in between all of these
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
so preparing I could have scales I could
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
have large amounts of baggies uh
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
repackaging could be Bales for for
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
heroin uh storing could be again storing
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
units for cocaine so that portion there
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
I do not like the next portion
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
containing nominal amounts for the
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of drug checking I I like the
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
first two that middle one obviously we
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
will vote on this and we can strike that
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
out when we talk to representative Muse
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
but I like a lot of that but not that
 
00:43:57.069 --> 00:43:57.079 align:start position:0%
middle portion
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking at the amendment
 
00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.270 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking at the amendment
now

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
with it's actually within the bill
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
itself okay I'm sorry I'm trying to um
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think this was the one that
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Muse got as an amendment
 
00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:11.319 align:start position:0%
and then it got put into the bill it's
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
on uh page two
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
line 16 we go down to where it's uh
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
struck out in lines
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
1819 so you can speak upon that yes so
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
you would take
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.710 align:start position:0%
you would take
out

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:44:29.829 --> 00:44:29.839 align:start position:0%
I would take out
 
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
the where is it here preparing packaging
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
repackaging storing so that should be
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
put back into the statute because I see
 
00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:42.839 align:start position:0%
this as a a bypass an endar around for a
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
drug trafficker if you will to say I'm
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
just testing this and it doesn't really
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
list amounts within that section okay
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
thank you for
clarifying

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
represent so now we've got two places
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
where we agree that the language in the
 
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.309 align:start position:0%
where we agree that the language in the
unapproved

00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
unapproved
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
amendment should be changed and there
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
should be some assertions maybe and some
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
deletions and some different amounts and
 
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
all of
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
that so I I I would think that probably
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
the uh appropriate role for this
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee would be to work on what
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
would be the
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
whatever the next
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
unapproved unapproved amendment is and
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
then when you convene your next meeting
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
where I probably won't be here you you
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
can then vote on the two if there happen
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
to be two opposing amendments you can
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
vote on the two amendments and you come
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
out with a result or whatever but I just
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
think that I think that we've
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
accomplished a lot by the discussion
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
we've had here to narrowing down what
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
the the objections are to an amendment
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
written thank
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
else representative C thank you um and
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for pronouncing my name
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
correctly I really appreciate that um so
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
um so if we look at the single page
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment 50 Z 20 20235 15 if we go down
 
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:31.480 align:start position:0%
to lines 9 and 10 if that were to say
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
drug paraphernalia shall not include
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment or processing
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
storing or containing nominal amounts
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of drug checking but
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
strikes the words preparing packaging
 
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.710 align:start position:0%
strikes the words preparing packaging
and

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
repackaging is is you would be
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with would you be
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that
 
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
language I would I think representative
 
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:57.720 align:start position:0%
Reed I don't want to speak for you but
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
you could interject uh it seems like
 
00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
we're in agreement with that we're not
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
really I'm not really caring so much
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
about that amount because right it's it
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
is nominal it's that like a
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
representative no said it's the Lincoln
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
head it's tiny tiny tiny so may I
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
propose we uh resubmit this amendment
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
with our committee names on it with
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
those changes to present at our next
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
meeting am I can I do that right
 
00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.549 align:start position:0%
meeting am I can I do that right
representative

00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
you can do I mean we can do whatever we
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
want to do and I mean you could even go
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
I um Brad might have an tell something
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
about this you could I suppose right now
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
make an amendment have the amendment
 
00:47:48.589 --> 00:47:48.599 align:start position:0%
printed up and then you would be able to
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
vote on that Amendment as the
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee and
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
you could do it in this in this meeting
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
or you could choose to go to another
 
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
meeting that's up to the
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
chair I know we have real and thank you
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative Newman uh I know we have
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
real busy schedule so if we can try to
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
bang this out today that would be
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
excellent uh represent
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
mu yeah just and you know I don't mean
 
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:15.640 align:start position:0%
to drag it out or anything um you know I
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
but okay so preparing I feel like that's
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
something that we could get into really
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay what is that entail right um but
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
when we're saying packaging and
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
repackaging storing like these kind
 
00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:28.599 align:start position:0%
these things kind of um are similar in
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
my mind I mean uh talking about
 
00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
packaging I mean that's what you carry
 
00:48:34.349 --> 00:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
it in right like that's that's what it's
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
contained in so I mean essentially what
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
that would be is like a bag right so
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's got to be in something um to be
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
able to get it to a place where you can
 
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
test it or whatever and so I feel like
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
that in that in that you know in this
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
context makes sense um of course it does
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
say for the purpose of drug te checking
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
and then it is you know a nominal amount
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
so that would really you know it would
 
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
have to be a tiny little you know a tiny
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
little um bit in there there so what
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is I don't know
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
itsy-bitsy little bags I just think I
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure why we would take out
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
packaging and repackaging because I feel
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
like the reason those things are in
 
00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
there is because there're there are
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
things that it would need to be by
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
necessity it would need to be
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
transported in so that you could get it
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
to a place where you can test it so I
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
don't like I said I don't mean to
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
belabor the point but I'm not really
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
sure why we would necessarily need to
 
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
take those out to accomplish what we're
 
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do today thank you represent
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
question so if somebody buys their drugs
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
and um I don't know how they would buy
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
it or or what but I would assume that
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
they would buy a certain amount they
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
would scoop off a a minuscule amount put
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
it in another bag and if they didn't
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
have their test strips bring it to a
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
center to test I can understand that use
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
of packaging and
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
repackaging but um still I I I I think
 
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
that it I would be happy if it said drug
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
parapan Alia sh not include fentanyl
 
00:49:59.789 --> 00:49:59.799 align:start position:0%
test strips packaging or or nominal
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
amounts for drug testing that is just
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
very narrow very specific and not open
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
to interpretation you know um because if
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to have your drugs in a
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
bigger bag and you put it in a little
 
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
bag you would leave your bigger bag
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
someplace else I would assume you
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't carry it with you but you might
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
but then you wouldn't need to repackage
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
it because that's a lot of manipulation
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
of a drug that you need to take
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I did it I would bring
 
00:50:29.119 --> 00:50:29.829 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I did it I would bring
it

00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
all I wouldn't be I wouldn't be doing
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
that so I'm looking at this as it's
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
under the fentel test strip and Other
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
Drug checking equipment we could have
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
someone who's a dealer a trafficker that
 
00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
is now going to reference reference this
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
in their defense they'll have their
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
fentel little baggies to say look I'm
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
testing this and that portion there
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
could exempt them from all of the other
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
stuff that they're possession within the
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
drug statute so this is kind of like
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're now circumventing another law
 
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
where again the addict and those who are
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
addicted are truly trying to use this to
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
help them but then you have the very bad
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
apples that are going to say oh look at
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
this a defense attorney is going to look
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
at this and say my my client can't be
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
charge because of the statute that's
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
just me and my law enforcement brain
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
thinking so would you like to say
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
something e either
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
side represent
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
Newman I want to just look at the words
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
the exact words in the in the sentence
 
00:51:28.589 --> 00:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
so it says drug paraphernalia shall not
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
include drug checking equipment or
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
processing preparing packaging
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
repackaging storing or containing a
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
nominal amounts uh for the purpose of
 
00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.430 align:start position:0%
nominal amounts uh for the purpose of
drug

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
drug
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
checking so it seems to me that that
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
last clause in that paragraph says that
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
for each one of these things the
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
packaging and the packaging and
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
repackaging has to incl has to only is
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
only allowed when it
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
is when whatever is defined whatever
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
those categories are when there is only
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
a small a nominal amount
 
00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
associated with that so I don't know
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
whether that sentence almost stands up
 
00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
on its own to limit it to any everything
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
in this bill would have to be related to
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
a nominal
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
amount thank you adding on to that where
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's that last portion where it says
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
preparing packaging repackaging storing
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
or containing if we can get rid of or
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
and put shall which contain a nomal
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
amount so that would then make
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
everything into that one cozy
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
sentence yeah because that when I'm
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
looking at that I'm seeing or so that's
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
where they're going to circumvent that
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
if we put shall uh we we'll get the
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
verbiage for it but shall and that will
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
link it all into one sentence does this
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
make sense so take it so we'll keep in
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
the packaging and preparing whatnot but
 
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
take out the or and change the language
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
to make it specific to the nominal
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
amount yes that will tie it all in that
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
way there again a bad apple won't be
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
able to now use this as a defense this
 
00:53:10.589 --> 00:53:10.599 align:start position:0%
will truly help those who are addicted
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
to get their testing and that's how I
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
view it yes okay that I would be
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that um because it yes
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:36.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay so we will be in recess for for
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.160 --> 00:59:33.029 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
I will now reopen the subcommittee work
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
470 representative
 
00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:45.039 align:start position:0%
selig so um if if changing the word or
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
to a more appropriate word is sufficient
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
we would be delighted to see the new
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
word or how that works because I don't
 
00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
know the legal ins and outs um since I'm
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer and I don't play one on TV
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
um but we would be delighted when we
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
reconvene to have that Amendment or to
 
01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:04.359 align:start position:0%
see drafts of it in advance of that that
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
we can fully support however the process
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
works because again I'm as new as
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent Reed okay I
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
would like to go word by word and see
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
which ones we could agree on again I go
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
back to this being too broad um more
 
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
moving away from harm reduction to um
 
01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
not addressing the ilicit elicit ity
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
part of it so if we can go word by word
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
um and see which one we can agree on um
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a good start so um
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
drug equipment um as being
 
01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
in Excuse me yes on on on the amendment
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
on um
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
0515 lines 910 okay all right so drug
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia shall not include and this
 
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
is where the sticking points are because
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
I feel it's too broad of a defin uh too
 
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
broad drug checking equipment if it
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't say if it's limited to fentanyl
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
test strips I would be okay with that
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
how are your what are your feelings on
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
that you want it go ahead we can have
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
this as an open discussion okay thank
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
you I I think we need it to be more than
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
just fenal test strips because there's
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
an other things that get put into drugs
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
that are also
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
dangerous and so to me having more
 
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
having it leaving it as drug checking
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
equipment is and and I would defer to
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative new who's got far more
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge but do we have other tools to
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
test I mean I know we have something for
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
cocaine but what other what other
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
equipment do is commonly
 
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
used represent so as of now what we
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
passed out of this committee um and on
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
the Full House and was um also passed
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
through Committee in in the Senate full
 
01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:52.839 align:start position:0%
Senate and signed off on by the governor
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
um what that is what ended up being we
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
we passed the testing and analyzing
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
equipment removing testing and analyzing
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
equipment I was happy with that the
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
Senate amended it a little bit and made
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
it so that it only exempts um feny and
 
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
xylazine test strips and we were
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
fortunate that xylazine test strips had
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
come out right before we had the hearing
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
so um luckily you know our uh Lauren
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
from uh New Hampshire har reduction
 
01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
Coalition was there with a test strip
 
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
and and saying we just have this the
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
thing is um so I so just to actually let
 
01:02:23.549 --> 01:02:23.559 align:start position:0%
me just answer the question in the first
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
place so there are things like um
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
testing the um test strips what what the
 
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
test strips do is very simply say
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not this substance is in it
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
even in that context it's not one thing
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
that tests for Fentanyl and xylazine
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
even it's one for feny one for xylazine
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
it tells you whether or not it's there
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
yes or no green or red right um so what
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
the analyzing equipment is and there are
 
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
a variety of things I was trying to find
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
it in here cuz like I said I I printed
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
up all these um I went on a little
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
research bench um but uh I can send it
 
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
to the to the committee subcommittee
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
afterwards but ah there was a really
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
good discussion of what I think it's
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
actually in this one okay so uh rapid
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
response fenel uh testing strips uh btnx
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
Laboratories uh Canada anyway that
 
01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:18.559 align:start position:0%
that's not the point but it's right in
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
here what it was actually is not
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
something that was sent out this study
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
itself was not this research itself
 
01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
paper was not sent out individually this
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
was in a uh in the list of references of
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
another letter that we got and so so
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
people may not have looked at this so
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
let me just share uh the information
 
01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
there's a um trar well that I guess
 
01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
that's the the uh brand name of it but
 
01:03:43.789 --> 01:03:43.799 align:start position:0%
uh Ramen uh spectrometer thermofisher
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
scientific okay um and then there's a
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
Brooker Alpha foror transform inferred
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
Booker Optics what this is is this is
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
kind of breaking down things so number
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
one there is equipment that would need
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
to be stationary it's very expensive it
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
would need to be stationary this is like
 
01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
a mass spectrometer that you see on the
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
on the doctor shows and stuff like that
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
that would need to be in a specific
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
location where people would need to get
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
to that location uh perhaps there could
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
be mobile but it would this would be uh
 
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
something that is you know uh that is
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
brought to people or people go there um
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
and and this is why they would need to
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
bring this uh why these other things
 
01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
would need to be legalized so that they
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
can actually transport it there or
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
um if there is uh you know a Grassroots
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
organization that goes out on the street
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
you know goes out and finds folks and
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
goes to a place where people are meets
 
01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
up has a specific day something like
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
that they can take a sample of these
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
things bring it to their location where
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
they have one of these you know big
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
machines big heavy expensive machines
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
and be able to test it there that would
 
01:04:44.349 --> 01:04:44.359 align:start position:0%
break down exactly what's in something
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
how much of something there is in there
 
01:04:49.630 --> 01:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
it is the the top-notch gold standard of
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
being able to analyze exactly what is in
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
this uh very small Supply supply of
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
drugs then there is kind of an in
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
between one so there's the yes or no
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
very simple yes or no that we've already
 
01:05:01.750 --> 01:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
legalized for some substances there's
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
the breaks everything down and then
 
01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
there's a middle one um that people
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
would be able to um organizations would
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
be able to um bring to locations and be
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
able to analyze something it would tell
 
01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
you how much or I'm sorry it would tell
 
01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
you what is in it not necessarily how
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
much as I understand it not necessarily
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
break it down there's this percent and
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
this percent and this percent but it
 
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:24.200 align:start position:0%
would be able to tell you that there is
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
this this this these you know specific
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
things that we are testing for but more
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
than one and that would be um I mean it
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
it's just invaluable to have this
 
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
information to know where things are um
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
to know when things crop up and that
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff so um I hope that's a a
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
decent explanation I can also send you
 
01:05:42.029 --> 01:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
the information about these different
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
kind types that's excellent because
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with two different um
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
populations here we're dealing with
 
01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
organizations that are testing to see
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
what's on the street as from and and
 
01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
that's different than the than the users
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
that are on the street so we're talking
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
about testing equipment for this is more
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
more this is a broader um bill that's
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
going to Encompass the organization and
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
the street level so it's going to so
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay that that I can understand yeah we
 
01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
we people that are running these mobile
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
clinics should be able to have these
 
01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
spectrometers and all those other
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
testing equipment but isn't that covered
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
under Licensing in in when they get
 
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
their you know when they get their their
 
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
CER certific certifications and
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
Licensing to run these mobile units
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
isn't that under that their
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
umbrella is this like
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
redundant as I understand it there are
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
very specific organizations that are um
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
exempt from you know that are able to
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
provide these things and able to provide
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
these Services um it's not a lot so no
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
it is not it's it's not necessarily
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
redundant I do think that um this was
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
made in This was um designed in a way
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
that it does does allow for individuals
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to go to a place
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
so yes uh it's very important that we uh
 
01:07:05.549 --> 01:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
protect people who are working in this
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
area um to be able to to do that like
 
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
what what you're saying like New
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire har reduction Coalition but
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
also um you know they also um other
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
organizations that are working with um
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
people who are struggling with this
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
anyway but it's also important that
 
01:07:24.670 --> 01:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
people to my mind um
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
that people are able to go to a place if
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
there is a central location where um
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who want to test their you
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
know their supply can go to essential so
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't necessarily be somebody
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
who's covered under their um lure or you
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
know uh an organization or something
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
like that so first of all there's very
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
specific organizations um and as far as
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
I know no I mean nowhere near enough but
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
a very very um small amount of people
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
and we have a huge problem I just want
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
to bring this up really really quickly
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
and R I know you want to want to speak I
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
think I've I've I've covered what I
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
meant to but um but I I just want to
 
01:08:05.269 --> 01:08:05.279 align:start position:0%
talk about the idea that we have a huge
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
problem in the North country and we
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
don't have really a wonderful in
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure out there this it's
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
people are it's it's more sparse it's
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
harder for people to access these things
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's harder for people to get to places
 
01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
where they and there just aren't the
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
support you know there we've come a long
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
way baby but there aren't um there is
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
nowhere near what we need and and it's
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
kind of understandable why but things
 
01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
like this allow for um much more rural
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
areas that don't necessarily have um
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have um the
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to be able to support
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
people um in an Institutional way with
 
01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
these people who we allow to do it I
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
think we also need to provide for for um
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know for folks up in the North
 
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
Country to be able to access these
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
things as well and I think yeah yeah I
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
think we need a division a clarification
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
between um organizations um that provide
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
these Services versus um the people that
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
um are for lack for um your local
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
everyday user you know what I'm saying
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a line that says you
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
can have the spectrometer you could have
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
all the equipment you need to run your
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
organization and I understand the North
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
Country sparse but the people up in the
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
North Country certainly should have
 
01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
access to their T Fentanyl and xylazine
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
test strips but not the spectrometers
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
and the heavy Duty stuff which would
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
again feed into the trafficking
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
component part of it which they probably
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have I don't know thank you uh
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative Newman yeah I I agree
 
01:09:35.550 --> 01:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
with what representative Reed said I'm
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out so you have the
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
three types of equipment that you said
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like that the middle and
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
the highend stuff is in an
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
organization and we can we you say we
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
have passed a law that that does the
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
other drugs other than fentanyl so I'm
 
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
just wondering would the in the North
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
Country would not would a user be have a
 
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
spectrometer or any of that kind of
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
stuff or would they be using the strips
 
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
and if we cover if we cover them having
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
the test strips that do that would that
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
be sufficient where we could take this
 
01:10:13.229 --> 01:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
that I just want to respond yeah I just
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to respond to that so um yes I
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
think that it is very helpful and good
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the North Country to have feny and
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
xylazine test stps be I think we can all
 
01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
agree on that I hope we do because we
 
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
just passed it but um but yes you're
 
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right I mean a
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
spectrometer is not something that a
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
user would have a spectrometer I would
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
argue is probably not even something
 
01:10:39.229 --> 01:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
that a that a drug dealer um would have
 
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
right or um but as far as mobile units
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
are concerned in being able to go out
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
and test something in you know somewhere
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
where there is a central location and
 
01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
things like that those are um that I
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
think is a is a very important um
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
element of being able to address things
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
like that in the North country because
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
there isn't the physical infrastructure
 
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
of locations right so mobile units are
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
are um very important in that way do do
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
they do that now do they go out mobile
 
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
and people bring stuff or I mean what's
 
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
the situation that you're concerned
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
about I do not believe for um for this
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
type of
 
01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
equipment I mean do they I mean is that
 
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
does that happen now that people bring
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
drugs to be tested at these that doesn't
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
exist it is illegal I mean
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'll just interject and then
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative seling maybe they can get
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
some sort of exemption like the
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
Standalone buildings do for the mobile
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
units uh I just think we can't just open
 
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
this up uh because again as we were
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
saying here it's just going to we do
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
want them to get the help but until we
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
can get those mobile units up and
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
running then maybe we can get their
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
exemption but in in the meantime I'm
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
seeing this as the traffickers the
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
dealers are just going to circumvent it
 
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative selling so I just want to
 
01:11:56.629 --> 01:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
point out that we we've been focusing on
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
fenel strips which is great obviously we
 
01:12:01.149 --> 01:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
need to you know help people not
 
01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
accidentally have fentanyl or car
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or any of the number of drugs
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
but those aren't the only things I think
 
01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
we need to be testing for I think you
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
know there's other things if um you know
 
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
thinking back a couple of decades um
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
thinking about all of the different
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
things that can be that marijuana for
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
example can be laced with which might
 
01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
include LSD it might include
 
01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:26.719 align:start position:0%
methamphetamines it might include other
 
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
things and so I think if we limit this
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
to fenel and I forget the other one
 
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
xylazine test strips we are making it so
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
that um especially if we ever manag to
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
get marijuana legalized in New Hampshire
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
but people who might be right now
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
procuring supplies of things like
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
that um by by taking out any by by
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
limiting it to fenel and and the other
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
test strip we're making it so that if
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to have some sort of
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
equipment if that was available to test
 
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
for other substances isn't available and
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
so you know I'd want them to have the
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
ability to get things tested for LSD for
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
um you know any for other substances
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
besides just those two and I worry about
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
making the focus too narrow Again by by
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
keeping it at the nominal amounts we're
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're taking away the drug dealers right
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
um access but also having done a quick
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
Google search these spectrometer things
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
are between 50 and
 
01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
$70,000 each so you know your average
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
drug dealer is not really likely to be
 
01:13:40.709 --> 01:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh procuring those
 
01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
so represent
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
Newman so I think we have to figure out
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
a way to get the wording to be that
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
specifically for this bill when we use
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
the word when we might even put a
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
definition of drug checking equipment in
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
there and put in there that for the
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill drug checking
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
equipment is for nominal amounts only so
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
so that you always connect what you're
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
exempting in here to just nominal
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
amounts anytime you
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
have drug checking equipment for amounts
 
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
not other than that it's it's it doesn't
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
apply generally to where they could get
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
around but that you have to go to the
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
lawyers to do that to figure out exactly
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
how you connect the two not nominal and
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
Drug checking equipment and only for
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
this bill so I don't know what you think
 
01:14:40.590 --> 01:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
about that or if that can be done we'd
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
have to further Define nominal if we're
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
still going with the 10 milligrams
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
because a nominal to me to you is it's
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
arbitrary I understand repres
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative selling so but if if it's
 
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
that specific would it make it so that
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
these like mobile units that are going
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
to say a homeless encampment who might
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
have a larger testing
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
capacity would would that eliminate
 
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
their ability to function I just want to
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
make sure we're
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
not I don't know if that's a separate
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
category I'm sorry I'm viewing this as
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
the end user and not the testing centers
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
so I know it's an larm Force I can't
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
speak for all of them I'm not going to
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
go shake down a mobile testing unit and
 
01:15:18.189 --> 01:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
say oh look at what you got I'm going to
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
arrest all of you that's not how I'm
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
viewing it again I can't speak for all
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement but I think we're
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
looking at the user in this particular
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
Bill and yes I do want those mobile
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
units to happen especially for the
 
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
people in the North Country what are
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
they going to travel 4 hours to test
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
their drugs
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
that's I don't know I agree with
 
01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative I agree with represent
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative tenar and Newman I think
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
that we could specify in the bill this
 
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
is for the end user and um organizations
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
however we could word it is it our
 
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
exempt because I police are not going to
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
arrest mobile units they're not going to
 
01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
so but to for clarification I would hope
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
not I just I would hate for us to
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
accidentally I I know there was another
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
LSR I submitted for research and I they
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
brought forward to me a number of things
 
01:16:10.669 --> 01:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
that I had not even known existed that
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
my LSR would have caused some serious
 
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.950 align:start position:0%
my LSR would have caused some serious
unintended

01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
consequences and so um I just want to
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not accidentally
 
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
making things like mobile testing units
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
um for harm reduction illegal by Framing
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
this too narrowly I just I want to make
 
01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
sure we're protecting those
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
abilities thank you
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
represent mobile testing units are thank
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
you um mobile testing units are only as
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
valuable as the information that they
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
can gather and that depends on people
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
being able to bring to safely feel safe
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
in bringing what they have to a mobile
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
unit even in the first place so I mean
 
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
it we we would be limiting the ability
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
of our of those mobile units of these
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
organizations that we depend on to uh to
 
01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
help us understand what is on the
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
streets we would be limiting their
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
ability in that people need to be able
 
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
to to bring things there without feeling
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
like they're going to get arrested I
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
mean think about this scenario and I'm
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying like you know there's
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
boogey men out there doing this kind of
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
thing but think about a mobile unit that
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
sets up on a certain day every week or
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
something like that right this we have
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
that now people will go and they'll
 
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
they'll set up on a certain week they
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
give out you know Narin a variety of
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
different things syringe exchanges um
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
all all kinds of different things so
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
they they literally have a schedule
 
01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
where they say all right we're going to
 
01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
be here on this week now if somebody
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
feels like they can't uh be comfortable
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
in bringing something there or accessing
 
01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
those uh things where if you know not to
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
create a boogeyman but if if if that is
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
known then it is also known to law
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement well it's fish in a barrel
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
then people who are coming there that
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
creates a situation where whether or not
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
that is real to someone in that
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
situation that is the uh that is the
 
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
perception or could be the perception it
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
just it limited it limits the amount of
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
information we are able to get because
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
it maintains a level of distrust and
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
discomfort and a lack of safety in being
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
able to access those things as well so
 
01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:15.560 align:start position:0%
it it people need to be uh people need
 
01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
to feel Comfort I'm repeating myself now
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry but I I just want to make sure
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
that what I'm saying is clear it's
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
creating a situation where it's great
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
that people are to be able to do this
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
but people also need to be uh need to
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
feel that they can go there um without
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
the threat of uh
 
01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
prosecution um and they need to feel
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable go there as well or else
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not getting the full
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
benefit of of what we're trying to do
 
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
here thank you I'm viewing this bill in
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
my law enforcement eyes and I I know
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
that was great that you brought up the
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
fish in the barrel uh I do not see law
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement hiding out in the bushes
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
wanting seeing people testing then they
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
go out and then they pull them over this
 
01:19:00.910 --> 01:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
is me pulling a guy over some guy is
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
beating up on his wife or something I
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
happen to find this this is not the fish
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the barrel when I was a trooper there
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
was a methodone clinic in Hudson and I
 
01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's even there anymore I
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
100% tell you that Hudson was not
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
hanging out there just waiting to try to
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
see if these people have methodone on
 
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
them heroin I wasn't doing that either
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I know your concerns that that could
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
happen there could be law enforcement
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
out there that need a a a pinch and
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to hang out and do that I
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
view that as almost entament to a degree
 
01:19:31.229 --> 01:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
uh and I know you're chomping at the bit
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
you can reply I just want to clarify
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm not saying that that could
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
happen I'm saying that that could be the
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
perception from people who have already
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
had negative interactions with police or
 
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
I mean it's criminalized so I I'm I'm
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
making no judgments and I certainly
 
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
don't expect that to be the case but I
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
am trying to look through the
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
perspective of the people who we want to
 
01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
be in to be uh to feel safe in in
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
accessing this you know what I mean so I
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that either you know
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
but I I'm I'm just trying to make sure
 
01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
that the point is to reduce barriers um
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can get the best information
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
we can know exactly what we're dealing
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
with um and in order to do that in the
 
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
context of a um of you know an illicit
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
substance the way to do that is to limit
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
the amount the nominal amount we've
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
defined the nominal amount we have uh
 
01:20:21.709 --> 01:20:21.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about changing the
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
language so that we're making sure that
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
all of this all of the language that we
 
01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
have is directly related to that nominal
 
01:20:30.189 --> 01:20:30.199 align:start position:0%
amount I think that's a you know I think
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful thing I I think
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's really what the goal would be
 
01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.590 align:start position:0%
that's really what the goal would be
here

01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
right thank you and represent Reed did
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
you have further no
 
01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:42.570 align:start position:0%
represent I just have a comment for the
 
01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:45.229 align:start position:0%
represent I just have a comment for the
[Laughter]

01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
chair and I think it is we are at a
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
point in the the decision that you have
 
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
that you have to make is is whether you
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
want to Wordsmith this right now whether
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
you want to get with the lawyers to
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
Wordsmith something to do in another
 
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
meeting or whatever it is we're really
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
talking about what we want to do with
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
just the words in this amendment to see
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think this amendment is
 
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to go the way it's not going to be
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
approved it's we are not going to make a
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation the way it is now so you
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
might either want to look at that you
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
might want to do that today or you might
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
want to have figure out what you want to
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
do based upon what we've discussed today
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
and and get the wording so that in a
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
future meeting of the subcommittee or
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
the regular committee you can make a
 
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
determination what you want to
 
01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
do thank you again for your Sage advice
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
I definitely will wrap this up I think
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
with just us five here we might be kind
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
of just going around in circles let's
 
01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
get more players involved in this to get
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
other perspectives because but I think
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
we work really well together to really
 
01:21:48.430 --> 01:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
craft this to hopefully get this ought
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
to pass so uh we'll have to reconvene at
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
some point for uh another subcommittee
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
meeting and I know that's really tough
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
with everything happening and uh for
 
01:21:59.790 --> 01:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
jobs but we're uh we're going to be uh
 
01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
adjourning this meeting for a future
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and hopefully we can try to
 
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
work on the dates today that work with
 
01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:08.199 align:start position:0%
the main subcommittee uh so I will be
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
470
