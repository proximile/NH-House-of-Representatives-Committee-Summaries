away from the building
 
00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 align:start position:0%
sew up at the top under absence absent
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
please put representative Edwards
 
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.110 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%

seconded by representative Merchant
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
Edwards Edwards
 
00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 align:start position:0%
if I have a point of order the minutes
 
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
change at the top for absent point of
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
order representative Merchant thank you
 
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.390 align:start position:0%
order representative Merchant thank you
Mr

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
um given the fact that I wasn't here for
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
the November meeting should I be
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
abstaining or
 
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
what action can I take on these minutes
 
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
probably abstaining because you would
 
00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
have no way of knowing one of the other
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
Senator gray
 
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
um Robert's Rules would allow you to to
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
the best of your knowledge that this is
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
what happened I don't know whether this
 
00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:01.259 align:start position:0%
committee is operating under Roberts
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
says the Senate does or under their own
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
rules so but
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
and house rules generally don't allow
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
abstentions so you're stuck in a
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
quandary and I think people have done it
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
both ways in the past in the committee
 
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
as many of you know my style here is try
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
to build consensus and I think in my two
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
years tearing before we only ever voted
 
00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
once and I'm really not sure this is
 
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
going to make much of a difference so
 
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.469 align:start position:0%
going to make much of a difference so
whatever

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
which is kind of Pearson's rules
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
okay any other Corrections that need to
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
be made we'll give you another minute or
 
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:45.890 align:start position:0%
be made we'll give you another minute or
so

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair I just want to remind you I
 
00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
have to step out at 10 43 for another
 
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
meeting at exactly 10 43 with military
 
00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
Precision yep thank you
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
and I know representative Merchant has
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
are we ready on the minutes okay all in
 
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.189 align:start position:0%
are we ready on the minutes okay all in
favor

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
I opposed see that's the workaround it's
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote we don't know how you voted
 
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.450 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote we don't know how you voted
okay

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
actually I wasn't here then either so
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
this is true
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
I was and I still don't remember it so
 
00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh just a little for those of you who
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
are new here how we usually
 
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:35.459 align:start position:0%
um have our meetings usually they are on
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
the fourth Friday of the month at 10
 
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.310 align:start position:0%
the fourth Friday of the month at 10
o'clock

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
on occasion when that's a holiday
 
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:46.220 align:start position:0%
weekend it is moved to the third Friday
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
at and it has been at one because a
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
couple of members have a morning event
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
on the third Friday so count on unless
 
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
there is a change count on the fourth
 
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
Friday we'll be meeting on the fourth
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
Friday of February at 10 o'clock
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
what usually happens here besides the
 
00:09:13.009 --> 00:09:13.019 align:start position:0%
roll call and the approval of the
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
minutes is
 
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:15.889 align:start position:0%
minutes is
um

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:15.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have a wonderful event that I
 
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
nicknamed learning from Laurie
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
and that was when Laurie shiban at the
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner would come in and give us
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
an update I saw no reason to change the
 
00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:32.459 align:start position:0%
title so we will start with learning
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
from Lori and that may go for oh some of
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
us hope quite a long time we'll see but
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
she is the interim commissioner then
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
after that different
 
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
different reports are given if you
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
remember when we vote on bills it will
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
say such and such a committee is
 
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
established and they are to make an
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
annual report to the HHS oversight so we
 
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
will hear numbers of those reports
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
and then the final thing that can take
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
place is something special something
 
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:10.700 align:start position:0%
particular that is to say
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
we are wondering about something at DHHS
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
and so we would like to bring in an
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
individual to talk to us about that or
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes somebody over there it's not a
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
regular report but there's something
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
they'd like us to know and they get on
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
the agenda so if there's something you
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
would like to know about let me know and
 
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
we will make sure that we schedule this
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
for an upcoming meeting
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of what we do here any
 
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:49.459 align:start position:0%
learning from Lori we welcome
 
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
interim commissioner Lori Weaver
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you I was waiting for
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
a question if there would be CEUs given
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
out after learning with Lori I assume
 
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.690 align:start position:0%
out after learning with Lori I assume
that

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the opportunity
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
I am Lori Weaver the interim
 
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department just a
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
little bit about myself I have been with
 
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
the department for 25 years uh
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
in different roles last three years as
 
00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459 align:start position:0%
the Deputy Commissioner prior to that an
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner and prior to that
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
and various director roles within the
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
department so I'd like to think that I
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
know the department fairly well however
 
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
in the last six weeks I've learned a lot
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
of things that I already didn't know and
 
00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
I've been there a really long time so
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm learning as well
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
learning with Lori that's right I
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
thought for this morning the update
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
would probably be most appropriate to
 
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
sort of lay out for you some of my
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
vision for the upcoming year as interim
 
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
you know there's never any guarantees of
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
how long I'll be in this role but I will
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
just look forward to the year and set
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
some goals and benchmarks and I wanted
 
00:11:59.449 --> 00:11:59.459 align:start position:0%
to share with you today what what we
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
were looking at doing and and part of it
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
is not being able to do a strategic plan
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
in the year is really challenging but
 
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
what can we do and we can do some
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
planning so I will be introducing to the
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
organization I haven't fully done it yet
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
it's coming up next week talking to all
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
of the staff
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
what I'm calling a road map a 2023
 
00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:19.459 align:start position:0%
roadmap for HHS
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
so it's basically a high level plan that
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
we are going to put forth four
 
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.459 align:start position:0%
commitments within the department that
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
we are intentionally focusing on and
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
will guide all of our work against
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
and hold ourselves accountable to those
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh commitments over the upcoming year we
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
will be sharing progress with this
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
committee with fiscal committee with any
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
other committee as appropriate as well
 
00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:44.899 align:start position:0%
as external stakeholders how we're doing
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
and where we may need to be improving so
 
00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:50.579 align:start position:0%
at a high level I can share with you our
 
00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
commitments there's four of them and the
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
first one really is investing in our
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
Workforce and our culture just like many
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
other sectors we are hurting from a lack
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
of staff so I really want to focus on
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
building up that Workforce
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
not only hiring people but also
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
increasing retention rates why why do
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
people stay getting them to stay and
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
then obviously working in our culture so
 
00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339 align:start position:0%
we'll be spending
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um quite a bit of time on
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
on that setting some goals for what
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
where do we want to be at the end of
 
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
the one of the second uh commitments
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
is uh managing our resources effectively
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
and efficiently and this is really about
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
aligning up all of our internal
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
operational pieces so that we don't have
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of duplication and to ensure that
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
the resources that we do have are
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
targeted on the things that are
 
00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
priorities for us so as you probably
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
know the department is really large and
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of things happening all of
 
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
the time and if we could align and
 
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.310 align:start position:0%
the time and if we could align and
strategically

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
strategically
 
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:53.540 align:start position:0%
resource those uh
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
resources appropriate those resources to
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
the priorities I'd like to be able to
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
see us get farther along in this
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
upcoming year so that's really if you
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
think about a project governance
 
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
structure it's really our leadership
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
looking at everything that comes in from
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
above below and from side is this
 
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
something the Department's going to do
 
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
we need to see how it aligns with our
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
priorities and do we have the resources
 
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
to do it at least for this first 12
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
months and kind of hand in glove with
 
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
that is what we call enhancing
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
organizational value
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
so for what we are doing how well are we
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
doing it so it's really about metrics
 
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
and it's really about
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
um working with our partners to make
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
sure that what we spend our money on and
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
what we're attending intending for an
 
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
outcome or service what population are
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
we trying to help is that contract or
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
that service showing us those results
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
and if not how do we align that so we
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
don't get to the point where we've
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
contracted and spent a lot of money but
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
we don't have the results so we're
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
really going to be focusing in our
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
division of
 
00:14:59.290 --> 00:14:59.300 align:start position:0%
quality assurance to hone in on that
 
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
and then our fourth commitment is
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
internally related but it's also
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
externally related and we call it
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
promoting thriving communities and
 
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's really about looking at making
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
sure for those services that it's the
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
right service for the right individual
 
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
at the right time
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
so you might say well what does that
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
mean well we could look at initiatives
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
like our children's system of care model
 
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
we know that we spent a good amount of
 
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
time and money building up that
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and we have it but we
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
also know that our utilization is low
 
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
because we don't have staff in those
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
programs to staff it so we have children
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
backing up in hospitals that could be
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
discharged but they don't have a place
 
00:15:38.689 --> 00:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
to go so it's really looking at that as
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
well as like Juvenile Justice
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
transformation and moving to a
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
restorative model rather than a punitive
 
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
model so there's a couple other pieces
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
in that but my promise to you would be
 
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
that once I have all of those goals and
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
as identified and outcomes I will be
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
sharing that with you I just I need to
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
share with my organization my Workforce
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
first and that's coming up in the next
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
two weeks and this was developed just so
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
to just to bring Clarity uh this this
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
was in terms of my vision of what I was
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
seeing in the 12 months that we needed
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
to do I engaged all of my leadership
 
00:16:11.449 --> 00:16:11.459 align:start position:0%
team to weigh in and help with that as
 
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
well as the boots on the ground the
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
people that are going to be doing this
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
work so that's what taking that's where
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
at the point now finalizing all that and
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
getting ready to launch it so I thought
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
that was probably helpful for an update
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
it is very helpful thank you and uh
 
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
councilor Williams
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
do you have those handy sheets that you
 
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
know I love so much that is the names
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
and positions and phone numbers and
 
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.910 align:start position:0%
and positions and phone numbers and
everything

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
okay and you can bring some hard copies
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
at the end of the month if you would
 
00:16:47.699 --> 00:16:49.129 align:start position:0%
at the end of the month if you would
please

00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
It's a Wonderful sheet it's it tells us
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
who all the division heads department
 
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
heads are and about I want 80 85 percent
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
of them come under your committee and
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
the other 15 percent children and family
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
come under that committee which I chair
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a good who do I call listing if
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
you don't have one you're going to get
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
one very soon I I thank you uh Tony
 
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
Williams did give us
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%

standing still such as me
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
um it's good to have a few extra copies

um so I am just going to give a couple
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
of brief introductory remarks and then
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
actually bring the people who actually
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
do the work to present the reform our
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire child fatality review has
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
been around for decades um with the
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
purpose to identify and collect data
 
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
about the cause and Manner of Child
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
deaths and importantly to provide
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
prevention recommendations based on that
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
data in New Hampshire right now just I'm
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
going to cut to the Chase and tell you
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
that the top five causes of
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
unintentional deaths among children and
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
that is age one zero to 21 include
 
00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths accidents from ATVs and
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles motor vehicle accidents
 
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
accidents drowning and blunt for ours
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
trauma equally concerning is that
 
00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
suicide is by far the leading cause of
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
intentional deaths suicides by hanging
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
suicides by Firearms suicides by
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
poisonings between 2017 and 2021 there
 
00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
were 93 suicides of Youth up to age 21.
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
each of them heartbreaking each of them
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
leaving a family in grief so before I
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
hand this over to the team that put this
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
report together there's three reasons
 
00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:01.559 align:start position:0%
why I think that this report is
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
important one it's powerful it's data
 
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
driven and I think members of your
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
policy and finance committees you know
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
it gives you the information that you
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
need as you think about your own
 
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
priorities and as you think about policy
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
setting for the entire state
 
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:21.140 align:start position:0%
number two the focus is on prevention
 
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
while we are lucky that New Hampshire's
 
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
child mortality rate is well below the
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
national average one preventable death
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
is too many so this is um
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
we understand deeply that one grieving
 
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:39.539 align:start position:0%
family is too many and three this report
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
is a reflection of partnership it is not
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
the Department's report this is the
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
report of a committed group of
 
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:49.580 align:start position:0%
community-based individuals doctors
 
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists health behavioral health
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
specialists on and on prevention folks
 
00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:57.299 align:start position:0%
they have all reviewed this data and
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
they have had robust conversations about
 
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:01.460 align:start position:0%
what we can do better
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
everyone on the review panel is
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
committed to the notion that preventable
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
child death is a collective problem and
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
that Solutions can be found in the
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
community as well as in our homes so I'm
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
going to hand it over to Rhonda Siegel
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
Mark Clement and Joe Porter and they're
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
going to walk you through the report if
 
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
if I may
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you you may thank you
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
question from representative Edwards
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning you know I
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
can't let you get away without at least
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
one question right
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
um so uh I I I skipped ahead I I the
 
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:39.860 align:start position:0%
recommendations pages on six and seven
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
sing to me what would make it really
 
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
great is to know is there a specific
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation where you think
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
legislative action is required and can
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
we highlight the recommendations with
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
for which you would expect some
 
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
legislative support it's that is a great
 
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
legislative support it's that is a great
question

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
um and it's a great idea so when the
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
group when the committee and they can
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
talk more about it the chairs of the
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
committee put together those
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
recommendations I think they can speak
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
to whether or not they feel like some of
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
those rise to the level of policy
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
interventions right now many of the
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations are really
 
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
community-based recommendations there
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
are things we can do now things we can
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
do with our partners but I'd love for
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
the um two chairs of the committee to
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that and take that as a note
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
for the next time we prepare the report
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
to be able to highlight that right up
 
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.330 align:start position:0%
to be able to highlight that right up
front

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
front
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:40.370 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming intentional you
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned intentional death I'm assuming
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
that the great majority would be suicide
 
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
yes 88 of the intentional deaths are
 
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
suicide the others are homicide I was
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
going to say so the other bucket is
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
basically homicides and that's that was
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
what I was going to get at the number I
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
wasn't really aware of how many
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
homicides 12 percent as you're saying
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just about 12 I'm sure I don't
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
have the report I didn't bring the
 
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:06.059 align:start position:0%
report up with me to give you the exact
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
number but
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
um by far again suicide is the leader of
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
the intentional but we have had
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
homicides in that age group from 0 to
 
00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.470 align:start position:0%
homicides in that age group from 0 to
21.

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
21.
 
00:23:18.289 --> 00:23:18.299 align:start position:0%
it's very concerning wow thank you yeah
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so I will hand it
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
over to this group thank you
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
and they are aware that we're supposed
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:32.580 align:start position:0%

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
established a child fatality Review
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
Committee whose function is to answer
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
the following two questions what could
 
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
have been changed that would have
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
prevented the death
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
and what changes are necessary to
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
prevent future deaths
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
so for Steward and sdy we review all
 
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
deaths in a state however that's not the
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
case for child deaths we select cases
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
Based on data Trends as presented in the
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
report and we work hand in hand with the
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
office of the chief medical examiner who
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
is our is a vital partner
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
um for State fiscal year 22 which this
 
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
report is about in the larger child
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
fatality Review Committee we focused on
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
suicide and motor vehicle deaths
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
um we reviewed eight cases in six
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
meetings my colleagues are going to tell
 
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
you a little bit about what we do in
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
those meetings and talk to you a little
 
00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:54.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.169 --> 00:26:57.179 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
talk about the New Hampshire child
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
fatality Review Committee
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
as mentioned my name is Mark Clement
 
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a child psychologist a retired
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
maritai Colby Sawyer College faculty
 
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
member and I still teach part-time at
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
New England College
 
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
let me give you some background on child
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
fatality view teams
 
00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire child fatality Review
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
Committee was inaugurated by executive
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
order of Governor Judd Gregg in 1991.
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
the committee was restructured in 1996
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
by a subsequent executive order of
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
Governor Merrill
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
which placed the committee under the
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
auspices of the Department of Justice
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
where it remained until 2019 legislation
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
that which placed us under the
 
00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
now I've served as chair or co-chair
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
since that 1996 restructuring
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
the committee published and sent to
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
Governor Shaheen its first annual report
 
00:28:00.289 --> 00:28:00.299 align:start position:0%
in October of 1998 and I know you have
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
our most recent annual report
 
00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:06.419 align:start position:0%
now every state in the United States has
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
a child fatality Review Committee
 
00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:12.020 align:start position:0%
they all function slightly differently
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a single team
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
most large states have multiple teams
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
like Massachusetts Michigan New York Etc
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
and an overarching State team
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
some teams only review child abuse bets
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
some have large budgets large staff
 
00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:33.299 align:start position:0%
dedicated to just Child reviews child
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
fatality reviews
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
and there are multiple of other
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
differences so
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
there's a national Center for review and
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
prevention of child deaths based in
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
Washington D.C
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
they provide guidance educational
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
materials and National Data to the state
 
00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:50.090 align:start position:0%
materials and National Data to the state
teams

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
teams
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
but they have no control over our Review
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
Committee and how we operate okay we do
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
our work in ways that we feel our best
 
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
for the protection of children in New
 
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.430 align:start position:0%
for the protection of children in New
Hampshire

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
my role today is to help you understand
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
how the committee does it works does its
 
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
work as mentioned there are five
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
objectives for the committee listed in
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
our legislation
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
and to synthesize them basically what
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
they say is that we are to review the
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
deaths of New Hampshire children
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
and generate recommendations that we
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
feel will reduce the probability of
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
children dying from these other causes
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
we have a committee of 28 highly placed
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
and highly highly qualified New
 
00:29:33.889 --> 00:29:33.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire professionals
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
who represent virtually every public and
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
private agency that is working with and
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
four children
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
our membership is designated in the
 
00:29:42.659 --> 00:29:43.850 align:start position:0%
our membership is designated in the
legislation

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
we meet every other month to review
 
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
child fatalities and to generate
 
00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.090 align:start position:0%
child fatalities and to generate
recommendations

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to describe to you how a
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
typical meeting is organized and run
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
but before I do that I need to make
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
three General statements
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
first of all our major responsibility is
 
00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.330 align:start position:0%
first of all our major responsibility is
confidentiality

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
every member signs a confidentiality
 
00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
agreement that prohibits them from
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
sharing any information that's discussed
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
in the review
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
any non-member who comes to the review
 
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
to present information for example a
 
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
police officer who might have
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
investigated that
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
also is required to sign a
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
confidentiality agreement
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
and I should add that our member
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
representative from the Attorney
 
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
General's office has been very
 
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.950 align:start position:0%
General's office has been very
meticulous

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
meticulous
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
in reminding and helping us with
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
confidentiality security
 
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
secondly we are not an investigative
 
00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.250 align:start position:0%
secondly we are not an investigative
body

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
we take information that is brought to
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
the committee by individuals or agencies
 
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
that have information to share about to
 
00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.990 align:start position:0%
that have information to share about to
death

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
death
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
and lastly we do not review any death
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
that is presently in litigation or has
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
the possibility of future litigation
 
00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
this is our guidance from the attorney
 
00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.450 align:start position:0%
this is our guidance from the attorney
general

00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
after all litigation and appeals have
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
we start each of our meetings in a
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
public session
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
or after some introductions and initial
 
00:31:14.049 --> 00:31:14.059 align:start position:0%
business we have a presentation
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
regarding data and regulations that are
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
related to the types of deaths we're
 
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.269 align:start position:0%
related to the types of deaths we're
reviewing

00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
reviewing
 
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
for example in reviewing suicide deaths
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
last year we had an individual from New
 
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
State Suicide Prevention coordinator
 
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
come and give us a presentation about
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
suicide vests in the state of New
 
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.130 align:start position:0%
suicide vests in the state of New
Hampshire

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:36.419 align:start position:0%
our last review a few weeks ago we
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
reviewed the death of children died in
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
fires we had members of the Fire
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
Marshal's Office do a presentation on
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
fire deaths in New Hampshire and fire
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
safety regulations
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
the purpose of these presentations that
 
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee of where aware
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
of what the latest regulations and data
 
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.649 --> 00:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
at that point after the presentation we
 
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.700 align:start position:0%
go into a non-public session and any
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
members of the public who are present
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
are asked to leave the room
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
information about the death is then
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
presented by any individual or agency
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
that has information
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
we typically start with law enforcement
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
then a chief medical officer
 
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
dcif if they have any information EMS
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
any routine or non-routine medical
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
information Behavioral Health
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
and then anyone else who has any
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
information from their agency
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
we then open it up to any questions that
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
members have about that information
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
once all the questions are answered and
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
all the information is presented we move
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
on to the recommendations part of the
 
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.049 align:start position:0%
on to the recommendations part of the
review

00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:45.059 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
and this is where
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
my co-chair our co-chair takes over
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
Dr Clement because some people have to
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
leave a chair calls on representative
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
Edwards with a question for you thank
 
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.260 align:start position:0%

00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
discretion and and I'm apologize in
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
advance for just jumping to the middle
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
right away
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm looking at page six uh
 
00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:09.980 align:start position:0%
recommendation two
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh support health care provider
 
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
practices reviewing firearm safety at
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
well child visits and then the
 
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
implementation activity firearm safety
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
is reviewed as a routine part of
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
anticipatory guidance and Pediatric and
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
analysts and well care visits as per
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
Bright Futures guidelines I I just want
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
to share with you a very heated
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
conversation I had with the constituent
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
that was representative of other
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
constituents attitudes and they are
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
incensed when a doctor asks them the
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
status of firearms in their home they
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
don't think that's any of their business
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
it's not part of what the a typical
 
00:33:56.279 --> 00:33:57.490 align:start position:0%
it's not part of what the a typical
patient

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:57.500 align:start position:0%
patient
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
physician relationship ought to be
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
and the the request was can you please
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
submit legislation barring the question
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
being asked and of course I said no
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's a First Amendment violation we
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
don't want the legislature crawling in
 
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
between the position and the patient but
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
I just I just want to know if this
 
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
second bullet implies that it's becoming
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
best practice among pediatric physicians
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
to make inquiries about the possession
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:52.190 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
it is best practice because
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
um uh storing those Firearms safely is
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
is a best practice that reduces risk so
 
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:08.339 align:start position:0%
it's common I'm sorry to be interrupting
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
I just really do have to go oh yes but
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
but people who own firearms don't
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
typically go to their physician to ask
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
about how to safely maintain a firearm
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's anticipatory guidance for kids
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
for adolescents and children
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
okay I I just hope as you all roll this
 
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
out you remain extremely sensitive yes
 
00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
that this is this is not an area where
 
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
people want their Physicians crawling up
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
inside their households so I do
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
understand the other side of it though
 
00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
we don't want kids crawling around and
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
finding a gun and there being an
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
accidental shooting but but that's what
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
responsible gun ownership does yes and
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
if there is irresponsible gun ownership
 
00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.390 align:start position:0%
if there is irresponsible gun ownership
then

00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
those people aren't going to be
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
listening to The Physician given
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines anyways in most cases so so I
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
just I I if if this is a New Hampshire
 
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
Best practice that we're trying to roll
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
out and Implement I I just it would give
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
you a huge cautionary note
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
to the point I was just wondering
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
how many accidental uh what because I'm
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time just shoveling
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
through and finding the right chart I
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
know they're all in there I just haven't
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
found it yet
 
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
um could you just point us to the
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
statistics on uh that inform this as a
 
00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:44.990 align:start position:0%
statistics on uh that inform this as a
concern

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
so we know how many incidents we're
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
not many as director Tilly told you
 
00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
not many as director Tilly told you
about

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
um initially I mean New Hampshire's
 
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:00.140 align:start position:0%
child fatality
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
incidents is is fairly low okay the
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
intentional part of that is is suicide
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
most of which happen with Firearms
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
um okay including with teenagers uh
 
00:37:15.119 --> 00:37:16.630 align:start position:0%
um okay including with teenagers uh
homicide

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
homicide
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
unintentional uh firearm deaths are very
 
00:37:23.569 --> 00:37:23.579 align:start position:0%
rare okay thank you very much
 
00:37:23.579 --> 00:37:25.550 align:start position:0%
rare okay thank you very much
yeah

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to be sure that there was
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
a a reason for that
 
00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
issue being highlighted is it to this
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
point representative Murphy yes it is
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
you may speak no I was just going to
 
00:37:46.609 --> 00:37:46.619 align:start position:0%
um point to the fact that on page 17 38
 
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
of all
 
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:49.609 align:start position:0%
of all
um

00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
intentional deaths are at the our
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
secondary to firearms and I I think that
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
that question that representative
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
Edwards brought up is in is important
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
but it's also to recognize also that in
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
all well child checkups in all pediatric
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
checkups they're not specifically only
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
asking about Firearms correct they're
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
asking one of the leading questions is
 
00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
always if I'm you know and I've been
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
with my grandkids and my kids it is do
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
you feel safe at home
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and they're trying to probe their not
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
only their you know environment where
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
they live whether there's a gun
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
available or drugs available you know
 
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.140 align:start position:0%
there could be the same question they're
 
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
also just asking do they feel safe at
 
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
home so I think this is reasonable to
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
ask the question only because it is part
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the old the global question are you
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
safe at home and do you feel endangered
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
by any means by by virtue of yourself or
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
another person in the household yes and
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
that's what anticipatory guidance means
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh just asking a ton of questions about
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
um health and and environment and for
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
the record representative Murphy is Dr
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
Murphy so so you speak from experience
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
to this subject
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes but I was assuming I was speaking as
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy but with a
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
background in medicine so you may speak
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
out of both sides of your mouth we all
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
do I've done that often Mr chair yes sir
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
the question I was going to ask was
 
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:16.380 align:start position:0%
answered thank you
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be sure before I jumped
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
in okay well thank you um I also want to
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record the chair will
 
00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
recognize people who wish to speak and
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
if the chair misses it which he often
 
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
does you can just sort of point and wave
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
I will not be offended well thank you
 
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
for for the guidance and the opportunity
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
um to discuss the commission's work as
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
as my co-chair mentioned I'm going to
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the process by
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
which we get to the recommendations that
 
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
you see in this report
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the things that I
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate in my comments but I
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
will mention here just because it's part
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
of the discussion is that there's
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
probably many recommendations this group
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
would bring forward but the ones that
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
you see are related to the course in the
 
00:39:58.370 --> 00:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
course of the time that we were together
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22. so while that um that
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation around anticipatory
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
guidance around firearm safety exists in
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
this report we've had previous ones
 
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
around swim safety around drowning all
 
00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
part of the anticipatory guidance
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
component so there's a whole range of
 
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.310 align:start position:0%
component so there's a whole range of
Pediatricians

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
Pediatricians
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
related well child care visit
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
checkpoints that we talk about I
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
understand that firearm safety sort of
 
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:23.339 align:start position:0%
jumps off the page in this particular
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
report but in previous reports you would
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
see things that were also related to
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
Accidental deaths as part of
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
anticipatory guidance that would show up
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
that would be additional topics so
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
you're seeing ones related to the cases
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about in this year but
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
it sits in in the scope of a broad range
 
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
of of items that we've brought forward
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
as recommendations as a committee so I
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted that to be in context
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
because I know it sort of feels like
 
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
there's a singular topic that's brought
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
out which is true because it's
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
reflective of the cases that we talked
 
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:56.339 align:start position:0%
about in this set of conversations but
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
if you looked at our history you'd see a
 
00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
whole host of anticipatory guidance
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
related items and all of that comes from
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
the reality that when we review these
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
cases as Mark mentioned our goal is very
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
much to better understand the
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances of that case not because
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
obviously we can do anything about that
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
case but we want to understand how we
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
can learn from those cases for
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
additional recommendations for both
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
prevention and promotion of positive
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
activities the way that we do that is we
 
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
shape those conversations around risk
 
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
factors and protective factors
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
oftentimes despite the outcome of the
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
case there are lots of historical
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
components of a child's history that
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
bring forward some things that could be
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
protective and we want to highlight
 
00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:44.579 align:start position:0%
those in addition to the risk factors
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
that that led to the outcomes that we're
 
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
seeing so um we talk about those
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
potential points of intervention to
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
prevent future child fatalities we
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
typically have a conversation about what
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
the risk factors were across the cases
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
that we've reviewed and what the
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
protective factors are and what you can
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
see is that within the specific
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the report
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
they often come into themes so many of
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
those themes are around increased
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
awareness that's often of resources and
 
00:42:14.579 --> 00:42:15.790 align:start position:0%
awareness that's often of resources and
services

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
what we have found in these reviews is
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
that there's often a lack of public
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
knowledge of some of the resources that
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
might be available to children into
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
families so we want to bring those
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
forward as much as we can and that
 
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
includes examples in these cases that we
 
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
reviewed around 988 as a mental health
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
service and distracted driving campaigns
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
so when we've talked about the motor
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
vehicle accidents and we've talked about
 
00:42:43.609 --> 00:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
the suicides we've seen these um what
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
what our as Mark mentioned very
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
well-rounded set of organizations around
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
the able understand that there are
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
resources that may have been beneficial
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
to certain families in these cases I'm
 
00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
trying to get information out to make
 
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
that awareness as great as possible
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
across the State Community Partners
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
again around resources that are
 
00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:05.339 align:start position:0%
available to professionals that are
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
interfacing with the families as Mark
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned so you'll see a number of
 
00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:10.329 align:start position:0%
mentioned so you'll see a number of
recommendations

00:43:10.329 --> 00:43:10.339 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
for our
 
00:43:14.329 --> 00:43:14.339 align:start position:0%
better leveraging those Health Care
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
Professionals or those service
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
professionals to serve as dissemination
 
00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
points of resources to families as well
 
00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
there's a number of times that we talk
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
about just strengthening the systems of
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
care I know commissioner Weaver talked a
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
bit about the workforce shortages that
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
we have we certainly see that resonating
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
in the outcomes in some of these cases
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
where there's maybe services that could
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
have been available for folks but they
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
may have had trouble accessing those so
 
00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:44.099 align:start position:0%
strengthening the systems of care comes
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
forward a number of times we also have
 
00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
recommendations around processes and
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
procedures we've learned about how
 
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
sometimes the communication points
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
across the organizations that are
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
touching families maybe are not
 
00:43:59.750 --> 00:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
communicating with each other and those
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
become potential points of intervention
 
00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
and then we also have for our own work
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
in the work of of understanding child
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
fatality better you may also see some
 
00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
recommendations around bettering for
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
collection of information that can serve
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
to inform our work and obviously the
 
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
work of reviewing fatality cases overall
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
so those are kind of the general themes
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
that I think that we we landed on in the
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
last couple of years of work I've only
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
been in the co-chair role since 2021 so
 
00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
there's probably a whole host of work
 
00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
before then that we could reflect on but
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not in the best position to talk
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
about that and then I just wanted to
 
00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
mention and representative Edwards
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned it
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
sort of after their recommendations are
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
created out of this committee then we
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
work with the Department's team Lisa
 
00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
who's here and Rhonda and others to
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
really think about how to implement
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
those recommendations so we what we
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
don't want to do is sort of end with
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
while this should be better and be done
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
with it at that point
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
um and so we've we meet and talk a
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
little bit about not only what should
 
00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:08.099 align:start position:0%
the department be doing but honestly
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of um
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
a lot of commitment among the
 
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
organizations that sit around the table
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
to think about what their role could be
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
in helping to move some of these
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
recommendations forward so that could
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
include a recent conversation that we
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
had where a representative from the um
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
the hospitals indicated that they feel
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
like there's some training that could be
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
done in the ER staff so we're talking
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
with them about ways to potentially
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
bring that forward so that kind of
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
implementation work doesn't necessarily
 
00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
get captured in the report because it's
 
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
a sort of multi-step project that
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
happens after that but certainly there's
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
a whole host of implementation
 
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
activities that come post those
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming out of the
 
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.630 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming out of the
committee

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
so with that I will I will stop because
 
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
I know we're short on time and answer
 
00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy great thank you
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman um
 
00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:01.740 align:start position:0%
this this sheet is great I mean it's got
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of detail and I haven't absorbed
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
any much of it yet but I I one thing
 
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
struck me is a couple things
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
on unintentional deaths in age 1 to 21.
 
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
poisoning with opioids was 38 that's a
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
huge number
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
if you look at the next page 17 and it
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
looks intentional you know suicide death
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's only one percent it's opioids so
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
that means these are this 38 I'm I'm
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
kind of curious as where did these where
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
do they where do they get the drugs now
 
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
is this drug is that school are on the
 
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
street or is this going through the
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
parents cabinets
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
um do you have that broken down as to
 
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
where they get those drugs in that 38
 
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.809 align:start position:0%
where they get those drugs in that 38
percent

00:46:43.809 --> 00:46:43.819 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
so we don't have it uh broken down in
 
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
the report but poisoning you're right
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
does include overdose deaths we could
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
provide that information for you
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
um so follow me follow up so the reason
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
I ask that is I'm a kind of a
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
double-edged question here is what would
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
this have looked like say five years ago
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know that 38 was it 38 five years
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
ago in the other part the reason I asked
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
if the children are getting their drugs
 
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
out of the out of the cabinet from
 
00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
parents you know several years ago we
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
used the pain as the fifth Vital sign
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
and so we really were prescribing
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
heavily opioids and I'm wondering if
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
that's a residual of having a lot of
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
drugs in the house versus picking up in
 
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
the street I'm just trying to understand
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
where the opioid deaths in the use of
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
drugs come from Street versus home
 
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
most of the opioa deaths in teenagers do
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
not come from something that they found
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
in their parents right so they come they
 
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
come from either purchasing it illegally
 
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
that being said I don't know the
 
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
specifics I can tell you we uh in
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health have something
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
called the national violent death
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
Reporting System uh where we put
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
together all these uh factoids I do know
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
because I've been around a long time
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
that uh 10 15 years ago motor vehicle
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
crashes uh were number one and not
 
00:48:20.819 --> 00:48:22.370 align:start position:0%
crashes uh were number one and not
poisoning

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
poisoning
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
um so there's been a very diff you know
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
definitive change
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
um in the last
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
10 15 years or so
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
and just one more follow-up and yeah
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
because I remember that 15 years ago
 
00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
that was the leading cause was you know
 
00:48:41.569 --> 00:48:41.579 align:start position:0%
trauma you know so in your chart says
 
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
ages 1 to 21 I understand the teenage
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
group but I'm just kind of wondering how
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
many of those are one to ten in is it at
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
a home that they get them and if I might
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
ask just one last question on page 14
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
you list under natural causes there are
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
two that are homicides and I'm just kind
 
00:48:59.410 --> 00:48:59.420 align:start position:0%
of curious as how homicide gets into
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
I will have to find out that answer for
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
you I'm just curious thank you
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you all for
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
being here it's good to see those of you
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
who I already know again
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I was just wondering with respect to
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle deaths has the
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
percentage changed I assume that the
 
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:37.940 align:start position:0%
percentage percentages changed because
 
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh opioid deaths have gone up but have
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
over that period of time motor vehicle
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
deaths gone down or are they staying the
 
00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.609 align:start position:0%
deaths gone down or are they staying the
same

00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
if you know it depends upon the year
 
00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
luckily in New Hampshire we're a very
 
00:49:56.930 --> 00:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
small state so the numbers go up and
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
down motor vehicle deaths in particular
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
fatalities have gone down because of a
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons seat belt use
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
the very cool way that a Car Works to
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
keep you safe in the event of a crash
 
00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.670 align:start position:0%
keep you safe in the event of a crash
um

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:27.660 align:start position:0%
taking the question following up on
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's question about
 
00:50:29.099 --> 00:50:31.069 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy's question about
the

00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:31.079 --> 00:50:32.510 align:start position:0%
the
accidental

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
accidental
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
um suicides by opiate
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
I think it was two or three years ago we
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
passed the law that the pharmacist has
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
to put an orange label onto an opioid
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
when it's dispensed by the pharmacist
 
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
it'd be interesting to go back over time
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
to see if that's actually had an impact
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
on reducing
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
the Imp the rate if you will or whether
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're just putting something on the
 
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
sticker on the bottle but in reality
 
00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's not really having an impact is
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
there a way for us to go back and look
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
at the timeline
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I don't know director Tilly
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
um the prescription drug monitoring
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
program is in our uh Division and I
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if that would be the most
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
I am sorry representative Merchant I was
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
having a sidebar conversation while you
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
were asking your question if you could
 
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
repeat that for me thank you sure thank
 
00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.510 align:start position:0%
repeat that for me thank you sure thank
you

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:31.740 align:start position:0%
two or three years ago we passed a law
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
that required the pharmacist to put an
 
00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:36.380 align:start position:0%
orange sticker saying it's an opiate
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
onto the prescription that had an opiate
 
00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:42.059 align:start position:0%
I would like to find out over time what
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
impact that's actually had on preventing
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
households the children getting into the
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
opiates or somehow looking at how that
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
law has truly impacted one way or the
 
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.270 align:start position:0%
law has truly impacted one way or the
other

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
how suicides possibly with children
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
occurring sure so I think we would have
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
to look at a couple of different data
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
sets as as Rhonda was saying we could
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
look at our pdmp and I'm sorry I can't
 
00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
see you because there's a fan right in
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
the way I feel awkward about that but
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you Mark
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
um so I think we'd have to look at a
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
couple data sets I'd have we'd have to
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
look at the pdmp so we'd see the rate of
 
00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.650 align:start position:0%
look at the pdmp so we'd see the rate of
those

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
um of those prescriptions the
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
um child fatality review could go a
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
little bit into the death report and
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
sort of understand is you know we look
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
at page 16 with those accidental deaths
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the poisoning of opioids you know we
 
00:52:31.609 --> 00:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
can see that there was one case again
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
this is over several years 2017 to 21.
 
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
there was a case among a one to four
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
year old I think we can all be pretty
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
confident that the one to four year old
 
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
did not do that intentionally in any way
 
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
um and then we only had another case in
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
10 to 14 and then a handful of cases
 
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
among 15 to 18 year olds so I think we
 
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
would have to look at our two data sets
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
what's in the birth in the death record
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
we would also have to look at p DMP and
 
00:52:58.970 --> 00:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
then I think there would have to be some
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
conjecture about how those two were
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
related I don't know that we can do a
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
direct correlation or a direct causation
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
from the orange label to a child getting
 
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
into it
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
I understood thank you I think at that
 
00:53:11.809 --> 00:53:11.819 align:start position:0%
point in time if you can at least look
 
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
it over a timeline yes we can absolutely
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
can uh the administration or the
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
oversight of the Poison Control Center
 
00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
is with also within MCH and our division
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
so we can ask oftentimes they're like uh
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
the canary in the coal mine and
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
um and so they also collect poisoning
 
00:53:42.849 --> 00:53:42.859 align:start position:0%
stats and often the first ones both that
 
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:47.540 align:start position:0%
citizens and actually uh Pharmacists and
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
my mind turns to think synthetically and
 
00:53:59.809 --> 00:53:59.819 align:start position:0%
I love to bring this this this and that
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
one or groups together for a group sink
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh yesterday I was talking with the
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
director of Motor Vehicles John marasco
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
about where do we go next in terms of
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
this card for Deaf motorists that was
 
00:54:14.329 --> 00:54:14.339 align:start position:0%
developed in the New Hampshire
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
commission for the deaf and hard of
 
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.329 align:start position:0%
commission for the deaf and hard of
hearing

00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:54:17.339 --> 00:54:18.049 align:start position:0%
hearing
um

00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
I could also see conversations with the
 
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
various gun groups in New Hampshire as
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
to how best we could encourage people
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
for safe gun storage that will at least
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
partially get the word out especially
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
whether our physicians who do not ask
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
this question of their children whether
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
they should or not they do not and it is
 
00:54:45.049 --> 00:54:45.059 align:start position:0%
for reasons we can guess how can we
 
00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
bridge the gap so my suggestion is as I
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
plod through
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
this wonderful detailed report I know
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
where my mind will go hey right here
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
this group should be talking with you
 
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
folks I would encourage that I find that
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
that that's works and I find that that's
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
probably in some ways already being done
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes absolutely I mean that's
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
really the power of this group is to
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
bring together those coalitions in your
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
note in the conversation around safe gun
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
ownership there's an example that we've
 
00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
had in New Hampshire for a long time
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
around the gun shop project where gun
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
shops really took some looked at some
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
education and worked with folks around
 
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention in adults so there
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
and that is an example of where we've
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
taken folks from the public health world
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
and the medical world and you know
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
responsible gun owners to have a
 
00:55:42.049 --> 00:55:42.059 align:start position:0%
conversation because no one wants to
 
00:55:42.059 --> 00:55:43.069 align:start position:0%
conversation because no one wants to
have

00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
um a suicide or an unintended death
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's related back to a particular
 
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.510 align:start position:0%
that's related back to a particular
firearm

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
firearm

00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
I've been texting various ones out there
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
to see if they wanted to bring us a few
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
things because we have the time and
 
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.300 align:start position:0%

00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record uh Henry
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
Lipman the Medicaid director director
 
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
l-i-p-m-a-n is how you spell my last
 
00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.870 align:start position:0%
l-i-p-m-a-n is how you spell my last
name

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:48.829 align:start position:0%
name
um

00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
I think there are a couple things I've
 
00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
been trying to bring to uh the attention
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the Committees of jurisdiction
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
um over the past week or so uh probably
 
00:56:59.809 --> 00:56:59.819 align:start position:0%
most importantly where you might be
 
00:57:04.089 --> 00:57:04.099 align:start position:0%
hearing from your constituents on is the
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
Consolidated Appropriations act that was
 
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
passed at the end of the year which
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
decouples the um continuous enrollment
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
from the public health emergency you
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
know declared federally we're starting
 
00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:18.260 align:start position:0%
to notify
 
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
individuals first with a heads up letter
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
um that has gone out over the past week
 
00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
or so to let them know that if they've
 
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
been in the protected status meaning
 
00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.309 align:start position:0%
been in the protected status meaning
that

00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
they haven't completed their
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
redetermination of Eligibility that they
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
run the risk of losing coverage
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
and on the the department had a meeting
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
with CMS to review our our unwind Clan
 
00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
with with them and it was an informal
 
00:57:53.089 --> 00:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
meeting we've got enough of an
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
indication that we're in the right place
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
with that and submitted our plan on the
 
00:58:00.410 --> 00:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
first which was required in order for us
 
00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
to start the unwind starting April 1st
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
they're about 102 000 individuals
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
today that are in that protected status
 
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:16.140 align:start position:0%
the largest group is our individuals in
 
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
the granite Advantage Program about 47
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
000 individuals there
 
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
the next largest group is actually
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
children a little over thirty five
 
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.490 align:start position:0%
children a little over thirty five
thousand

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
in our unwind strategy and if I'm going
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
on too long please give me a signal but
 
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
if this isn't good information for you
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
um the strategy that we're taking
 
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
because we have to spread the the
 
00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:43.549 align:start position:0%
because we have to spread the the
um

00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
the review of Eligibility over uh nine
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
one ninth at uh one-ninth meaning
 
00:58:52.609 --> 00:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
um of our total enrollment today which
 
00:58:55.970 --> 00:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
is about 250 000 individuals we can only
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
do one-ninth of them
 
00:59:00.049 --> 00:59:00.059 align:start position:0%
um per month and what we're trying to do
 
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:02.660 align:start position:0%
is look at first those individuals that
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
we've lost contact with and those
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
individuals who
 
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
um from a claims analysis have not used
 
00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.630 align:start position:0%
um from a claims analysis have not used
services

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
and what we're really doing is a
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
risk-based strategy so that individuals
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
that for example we know are residing in
 
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:20.900 align:start position:0%
a nursing home or you know have
 
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
underlying medical conditions we're
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
going to allow ourselves more time to
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
get to those people so that we're not
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know my main goal is people who
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
should remain on coverage that we're
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
trying to do our best we can to make
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
sure that they do and those that aren't
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to be eligible to make them aware
 
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
of what their options are
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
um just last Friday
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
the federal government announced that
 
00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
there'll be a special enrollment period
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
for individuals who are losing Medicaid
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
coverage and the fact they allow
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
um which is a little bit unusual before
 
00:59:58.970 --> 00:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
they even lose coverage within the
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
60-day window before they lose coverage
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
they can sign up so there would be
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
potentially no break-in in health
 
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.250 align:start position:0%
potentially no break-in in health
coverage

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
so that's a there's a lot of work going
 
01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
on behind that and I want to keep
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
um you know key stakeholders informed of
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
what's going on because I'm sure you'll
 
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
hear from constituents and you know if
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're missing something we want to hear
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
you know you may be a conduit to share
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
something for us to correct or to make
 
01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.569 align:start position:0%
something for us to correct or to make
right

01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
um the other
 
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
major initiative is we're coming towards
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
the 401 deadline of implementing the
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
adult dental program
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
we've made good progress there we
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
submitted all of our state plan
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
amendments and
 
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
waiver amendments that were required to
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
implement it as
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
required under legislation we believe
 
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
that we'll be through that process on
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
time you know my my only concern with I
 
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
think on that is you know with all
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's going on at the federal
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
government level would they potentially
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
fall behind with what they need to do
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
but you know I've reached out to the top
 
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
of uh of the chain of command there and
 
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
let them know that how important this is
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
and you know I've gotten an indication
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to help us get to the date
 
01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:18.980 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
01:01:22.089 --> 01:01:22.099 align:start position:0%
we have entered into a contract
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
with Delta Dental who will be the
 
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
um the entity that will be providing the
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
um you know the biggest thing in front
 
01:01:38.030 --> 01:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
of us is building out the network and
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
and that is you know over the next month
 
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
it'd be a good thing to report on um to
 
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
the next committee meeting because
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
that's sort of the key thing we're
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
working on it's it's not as far along as
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it at this point but you
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
know we know that's the most important
 
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
thing to to to to get done
 
01:01:56.700 --> 01:01:58.270 align:start position:0%
thing to to to to get done
um

01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
I think in terms of
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
um the other major bill that I think uh
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
you know on a forward-looking basis is
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
the reauthorization of uh of the Granite
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program which would otherwise
 
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:14.210 align:start position:0%
Advantage Program which would otherwise
expire

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
um December 31st of this year
 
01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
if there's not an action to to
 
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.990 align:start position:0%
if there's not an action to to
reauthorize

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
reauthorize
 
01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
today we're covering approximately a
 
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
little over 95 000 individuals on
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage
 
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.750 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage
um

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
of those you know our forecast at this
 
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
point is probably by the time we do the
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
unwind it'll be closer to 64 000. we
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
began the pandemic at about uh
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
51 000 you know the granted Advantage is
 
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
a program that's basically an income
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
driven eligibility
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
and uh what we're seeing you know there
 
01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:57.299 align:start position:0%
is I think that across the state that
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
you know the the beginning of the the
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
federal Public Health Emergency period
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
in March of 2020 that you know when
 
01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
people there was a high
 
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
um sudden increase in unemployment that
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
you know many people
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
um were able to gain coverage this way
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
they're also good candidates potentially
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to move to the to the
 
01:03:19.319 --> 01:03:20.750 align:start position:0%
to be able to move to the to the
marketplace

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.710 align:start position:0%
marketplace
um

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
and um so I think that's that's that
 
01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.270 align:start position:0%
and um so I think that's that's that
topic

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
topic
 
01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
um if there's a particular area that
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
you'd like me to address I'd be happy to
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and also thank
 
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
you Mr lippman for the taking this
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
question I I met with a constituent just
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
this morning and he's uh very concerned
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
for his mother-in-law who
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
um had long-term Insurance long-term
 
01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
care insurance and that didn't seem to
 
01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
really do much for them and now Medicaid
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
is um telling them that they had to
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
actually cancel that policy which
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
they've now done and doesn't give them
 
01:04:11.530 --> 01:04:11.540 align:start position:0%
many options they don't she has no money
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
and yet she can't actually be put into a
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
a home at this point because she hasn't
 
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
gone through all the qualifications on
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
where Medicaid is going to be
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
um what kind of advice do I have to give
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
to him
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
so I I think the best thing
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
um because these things can kind of get
 
01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
complicated is if you
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
um share the the person who's uh
 
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
representing that this is a relative be
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
happy to have someone reach out and call
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
and try to help them sort it out you
 
01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
know the process
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
um one one piece of legislation that
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
didn't get through last year was one
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
where uh
 
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
it was part of a larger bill but today
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
we have to do asset verification for
 
01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
going looking back to five years
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we're doing that process
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
we can see that maybe looking back three
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
years as an example that there's enough
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
information that you can make a
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable assertion I think there's
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
sort of a double edge here on the one
 
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
hand we're trying to protect the state
 
01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
from paying for services that they
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't on the other hand we're also
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
trying to protect the person to make
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
sure they're aware of what their
 
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility may or may not
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
be it's working with the
 
01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
the team within the department you know
 
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
we're we're always here to try to help
 
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
people sometimes it's it's hard in terms
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
of being able to pull together financial
 
01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
documents and the like that you know our
 
01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
team's very willing to to to help so if
 
01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.450 align:start position:0%
team's very willing to to to help so if
um

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
afterwards if um you don't have my phone
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
number I'll or email address I'll
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
provide that to you I do have it and
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
thank you and I will be reaching out
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
great thank you let me pick up on on
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
that very point on
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
um asset verification I know sometimes
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
on assistance programs always the
 
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
question of means testing comes up in
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
case somebody uh wonderfully gets an
 
01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
employment that now they don't need the
 
01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:22.849 align:start position:0%
employment that now they don't need the
program

01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
um you were pointing out on the one hand
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to the state on the
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
other to the um uh the individual uh and
 
01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
on granite Advantage do you means test
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
if so what is the way you do that so the
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage is purely an income
 
01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:45.059 align:start position:0%
test is not a asset component to that
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
um and that's because of federal
 
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
um standards on that
 
01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:49.789 align:start position:0%
um standards on that
um

01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
but we
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
have mechanisms to be able to check
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
people's earnings that sign up into the
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
program generally self-employed a little
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
bit different situation but people have
 
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
a responsibility report or change in
 
01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.470 align:start position:0%
a responsibility report or change in
circumstance

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
and if their income changes they would
 
01:07:10.849 --> 01:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
potentially no longer be eligible and
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
um and I could just share with you that
 
01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:16.609 align:start position:0%
um and I could just share with you that
um

01:07:16.609 --> 01:07:16.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:16.619 --> 01:07:18.670 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:07:21.049 --> 01:07:21.059 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire never stopped doing
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility and
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and people who voluntarily did the
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
redeterminations but we since June we've
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
been able to get over 31 000 individuals
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
through our Outreach to complete their
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
redetermination on a voluntary basis and
 
01:07:36.529 --> 01:07:36.539 align:start position:0%
that's an updated number from this
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
morning that I received and over 1700
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
people who we've reached out to have
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
told us
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
um we don't need Medicaid anymore we've
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
got another source of coverage so we've
 
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
been able to save the state money by
 
01:07:52.609 --> 01:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
doing that Outreach and I think probably
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
by next week if I came in it'd be close
 
01:07:57.609 --> 01:07:57.619 align:start position:0%
to 2000 from because we're working
 
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
lists where we might get a referral from
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
one of the MCO saying this is what they
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
said but we have to verify that
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
internally before we act on it
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you both and I'm I'm thinking of a
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
couple of things that have come up to me
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up to representative
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
King's question
 
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
obviously he has somebody's already in
 
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
difficulties but
 
01:08:30.169 --> 01:08:30.179 align:start position:0%
um I've had several people come and and
 
01:08:30.179 --> 01:08:31.610 align:start position:0%
um I've had several people come and and
ask

01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.329 align:start position:0%
ask
um

01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
how they get qualified because they're
 
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
helping an elder or a friend or somebody
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
and I have uh offered a number of
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
suggestions which range from 211 to
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
service link to going down to the uh DC
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
the department office in Keene
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
do you have a preferred way or a way
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
that you know of that's the best for
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
somebody or is there does it depend
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
entirely on an individual circumstances
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
literally because I I you'll be glad to
 
01:09:14.329 --> 01:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
know I I'd rather not refer everybody to
 
01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office so thank you
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
Chris santanello associate commissioner
 
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
Henry and I work really closely together
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
um for this I think honestly service
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
links right now
 
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
um would be the first choice just
 
01:09:32.450 --> 01:09:32.460 align:start position:0%
because our staff are so busy right now
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
working on the online doing Outreach
 
01:09:38.769 --> 01:09:38.779 align:start position:0%
making sure those that
 
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
are have continuous enrollment we get
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
through that second choice would be
 
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
coming to the district office
 
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
because lots of times if someone comes
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
to the district office our staff at the
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
front desk can answer questions provide
 
01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
them information so I would say service
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
link or coming into the district office
 
01:10:03.290 --> 01:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
okay thank you because I I will just
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
pass along that
 
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
um anecdotally service link is pretty
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
inundated as well I know and and I know
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not telling you anything you don't
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
already know I'm just reiterating
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
totally agree and again you can just
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
reach out to me and and may I ask
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
another couple
 
01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:25.820 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking of a fellow
 
01:10:28.729 --> 01:10:28.739 align:start position:0%
representative and director he may have
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
reached out to you already but
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
um has constituents who are
 
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologists who take Medicaid and
 
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
very concerned because there are unpaid
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
invoices six months out and I'm
 
01:10:47.689 --> 01:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
wondering what's happening with that so
 
01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
A representative did alert me to that
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
and gave me the phone number to the the
 
01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:56.540 align:start position:0%
practice in question
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
and I attempted to reach out to them I
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
understand they're away probably till
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
next week so we haven't made direct
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
contact yet but we'll certainly help
 
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
them out thank you and it you know it's
 
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
a concern because of course as you're
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
building out the dental networks I mean
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
providers are that take Medicaid or thin
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
thin on the ground and we want to keep
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
the ones who are providing the services
 
01:11:22.199 --> 01:11:23.510 align:start position:0%
the ones who are providing the services
so

01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
so generally there is a requirement that
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
we monitor in terms of timely payment of
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
claims and there are penalties if they
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
don't do that
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I think with that particular
 
01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
circumstance with the information I have
 
01:11:37.729 --> 01:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
that may be a little bit more to it than
 
01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
there may well be and and I just want to
 
01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:42.229 align:start position:0%
there may well be and and I just want to
again

01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
bring it up as a a concern because
 
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.850 align:start position:0%
bring it up as a a concern because
generally

01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
although it may be one specific set of
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
circumstances the the lack of providers
 
01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:55.739 align:start position:0%
is nothing new as a concern to every
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
person in this room so thank you very
 
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.750 align:start position:0%
person in this room so thank you very
much

01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald
 
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this is just a
 
01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge update a question for myself
 
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh service link did that take the place
 
01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire easy
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
no we still have New Hampshire easy so
 
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
service link
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
um and I was actually as as before I um
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
you asked the question I was thinking I
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
should have said sir New Hampshire easy
 
01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:22.620 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
um but yes we still have New Hampshire I
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
was wondering okay thank you very much
 
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
few questions for me picking up on
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
previous questions I think most of you
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
know I am part-time CEO of a faith-based
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
wellness center in Kingston and taking
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
medicaid patients is part of what we
 
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
want to do I also have to pay our bills
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering when we will see a
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
good increase in what providers receive
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
for taking medicaid people by my family
 
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.270 align:start position:0%
for taking medicaid people by my family
practitioners

01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
so the department and the agency budget
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
phase made requests there's also a
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
number of bills the largest of which I
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
think was written up in the news this
 
01:13:11.649 --> 01:13:11.659 align:start position:0%
this week Senate Bill 86 which
 
01:13:14.169 --> 01:13:14.179 align:start position:0%
proposes to add
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
145 million in rate increases over the
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
biennium and the first hearing on that
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
you're throwing it back to me and I'll
 
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
take it yeah sure I think this this is
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
um major issues that I'm sure that this
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
legislature will have to deal with this
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
session is how to you know that we're
 
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
sort of I kind of look at where we're at
 
01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
a little bit like uh the pressure
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
building on up on a dam that has a leak
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
in how much can can it be held back and
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
that has to be worked sort of through
 
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
I recently had a chat with uh Tom Rafael
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
from Delta Dental and I said how's it
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
going because as you know I was one who
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
took point on the floor of the house on
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
the dental bill and thank you thinking
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
that it would please God by 10 and it
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
passed by 90 something so there's hope
 
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
going forward on some of this other
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
stuff I think I'm doing my work but he
 
01:14:16.729 --> 01:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
pointed out that oh it's all well and
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
good to have the money available but you
 
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
need dentists who will do it how we
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
doing on getting dentists to take people
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
under the dental program so
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
um that's I think one of our still one
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
of our key challenges for April 1st
 
01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:33.780 align:start position:0%
we're working just before this meeting I
 
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
was meeting with people about that and
 
01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be meeting with probably
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
Tom Rafael next week in terms of and
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
what we can do to to build that we are
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
having some successes but we're not
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
where we need to be yet
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
um you know just going back to the rate
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
increase if I could talk about about
 
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:54.020 align:start position:0%
that for a moment last session you did
 
01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
pass rate increases and maybe just
 
01:14:58.689 --> 01:14:58.699 align:start position:0%
remind some of the key ones is
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
ambulances which we're seeing some
 
01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
challenges you may hear from
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
constituents about transferring patients
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
between hospitals or between nursing
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
homes and hospitals those that
 
01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
increase that brought New Hampshire's
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
ambulance rates from 25 percent to 50
 
01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:15.980 align:start position:0%
percent of Medicare
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
still I think an area of concern from
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
from an access standpoint to me as the
 
01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director we also added 25
 
01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.070 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director we also added 25
percent

01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:27.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
to maternity care delivered at hospitals
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
it was a the 25 percent was the average
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
we were able to increase the rates at
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals that still do
 
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
maternity by 34 and 24 at the larger
 
01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:45.169 align:start position:0%
maternity by 34 and 24 at the larger
hospitals

01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of other kind of rate increases
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head those are two
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
that that uh comes to mind but there are
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
probably a couple others that and
 
01:16:02.930 --> 01:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
are there plans afoot uh within the
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
department I know they're trying to hire
 
01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
department I know they're trying to hire
in

01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
the medical facility I look after we
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
have been partially paying students
 
01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
tuitions with loan forgiveness or
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
tuition forgiveness as they work for us
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
that is putting another step on a tall
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
ladder that they can negotiate I also
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
know Rockingham County nursing home
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
because that's my legislative
 
01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
responsibility as part of the delegation
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
we are doing similar what could we do
 
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
perhaps is there plan are there plans
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
afoot oh for example to help somebody in
 
01:16:42.649 --> 01:16:42.659 align:start position:0%
a dental school in exchange for to come
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
here to help with this population
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
we do um and Trisha Tilly's probably
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
knows more about this than I do but
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
within Public Health we have
 
01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.590 align:start position:0%
within Public Health we have
um

01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness program a loan
 
01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
repayment programs
 
01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
um that are available
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
um in addition we have been trying to
 
01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
help the County nursing facilities all
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
through the federal Public Health
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
Emergency we've been passing on the
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
extra Federal matching percentage
 
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
directly to the uh to the nursing
 
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
accounting nursing facilities uh in the
 
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
form of their Pro share payments and in
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
terms of the county cap calculations
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
helping out the the counties with their
 
01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
their obligations as well and it's been
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
a fairly sizable number as it's gone on
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
for almost three years just one
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotal footnote there that the
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
Consolidated appropriation act uh
 
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
carries the enhanced Federal match
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
through March 31st at 6.2 percent then
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
is reduced
 
01:17:48.169 --> 01:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
um a quarter at a time from 6.2 to 5 to
 
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
2 and a half to one and a half where the
 
01:17:53.630 --> 01:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
enhanced death map ends the end of this
 
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
director Tilly
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
how are we going to make this better and
 
01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:04.310 align:start position:0%
how are we going to make this better and
bigger

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.770 --> 01:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chair so um as Henry
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
noted we have our state loan repayment
 
01:18:10.729 --> 01:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
program and and specifically around
 
01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
dental we've also expanded it this year
 
01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
to private dentists who take Medicaid
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
clients that was a huge lift for us as
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
opposed to in the past we really had
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
dentists that were in our federally
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
qualified health centers or were that
 
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
working in one of those types of
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
facilities but to expand it to private
 
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
has been a big deal and we've had uptake
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
good uptake over it over this past year
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
we've been using arpa funds those funds
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
will go away at some point so that's
 
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
certainly a conversation for another
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
biennium to have but we have been very
 
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have arpa funds and some
 
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
general funds to provide that loan
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
repayment and the other piece is we also
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
have a recruitment contract where we're
 
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
going out and recruiting like crazy
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
I know that there's underserved areas
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
but there are underserved people groups
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
within a well-served area are we
 
01:19:02.649 --> 01:19:02.659 align:start position:0%
improving the underserved people in
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
non-underserved areas yes absolutely and
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
that's what we look at you know I mean
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a twofer so there's you know
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
and we have a whole bit of alphabet soup
 
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
as many of you know of hearses and and I
 
01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
mean in hipses and dipses and mipses
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
which are health professional shortage
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
areas but we also look at those specific
 
01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
populations and you know primarily of
 
01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
them are are low income and so that's
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
where Henry's work and my work always
 
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
intersect that we're always trying to
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have access for those
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
who have Medicaid and especially now as
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the new adult Dental
 
01:19:35.159 --> 01:19:36.169 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the new adult Dental
benefit

01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
you're speaking all of these terms made
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
me very grateful my mom fed me alphabet
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
soup as a child representative Murphy
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:46.980 align:start position:0%
director thank you so much for uh
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
sitting in the hot seat unannounced and
 
01:19:50.930 --> 01:19:50.940 align:start position:0%
without any preparation uh obviously
 
01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:53.719 align:start position:0%
interested him ahead of time
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that and obviously it's a
 
01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
Hot Topic it might you brought up the
 
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
question of stratification I certainly
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh that you can only do
 
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
one-ninth of the population at risk
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
right now at a time but certainly you
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
know risk stratification as to who will
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
fall off the cliff first and need it and
 
01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.219 align:start position:0%
I was wondering where what sort of data
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
you use to determine that is it simply
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
their age do you have access to their
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
employment currently do you have access
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
to their current health record that they
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
may have a need I was just kind of
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
curious as to where you had that uh
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
where that data came from us so we look
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
at their categorical eligibility so for
 
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
example someone who's in CFI the you
 
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
know choices for Independence or
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
long-term care or children
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
um but you know those are generally the
 
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
vulnerable groups and we early on the
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
process we did a lot of Outreach to
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
those and fortunately those are other
 
01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
than the children group is
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
um you know smaller very it's sort of a
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
smaller population then we added the
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
dimension of looking at claims
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
um that we had as to whether
 
01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
um they and we basically used a dollar
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
stratification to look at if they had
 
01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
zero claims over the past year that
 
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
suggests they're probably lower risk not
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
an absolute none of this is you know a
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
perfect science and then we looked at
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know certain conditions like someone
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
who might have hemophilia as an example
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
that you know going without coverage
 
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
could be a pretty serious to their life
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
situation then we looked at
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
um you know large people who used a lot
 
01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
of Health Care as being someone that we
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
want to actually do maybe some personal
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
Outreach either directly through
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
Department staff or through our mcos so
 
01:21:38.689 --> 01:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of states are just doing
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
it like uh last in I mean first in first
 
01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
out and you know we're trying to be more
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
sensitive to it and I'm proud of that
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
that we're we're making it that way and
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up is if you follow
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
up yes thank you
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
um so given a circumstance say somebody
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
this year in 23 is just about to turn 65
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
say in December is there any but they're
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to go off the cliff in April they
 
01:22:07.610 --> 01:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
run is there any way that they can move
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
up their eligibility date for Medicare
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
is that coordinated in that way at all
 
01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
to help them bridge that yeah they're
 
01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
actually uh thank you for the question
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
there are actually people who are should
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
be on Medicare that aren't there yet and
 
01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
those are another sort of group that we
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
want to work with carefully
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
I think that there are people who are
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
could potentially be dual eligible
 
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
before we actually let someone off the
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
plan we have to run them through our
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
what we call our Cascade to see if
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for something else and
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so that uh
 
01:22:47.209 --> 01:22:47.219 align:start position:0%
you know I I know as as much as we're
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
planning and we've been planning for
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
this for since July of 2020 on a weekly
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
basis that we're going to need your
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
antenna to you know because it won't be
 
01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.310 align:start position:0%
antenna to you know because it won't be
perfect

01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
01:23:00.169 --> 01:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
um in the sense that you don't people's
 
01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances change and and if we can
 
01:23:04.130 --> 01:23:04.140 align:start position:0%

Provisions in there that um deal with
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
also uh trying to support the
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
availability of
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce so that's a bill you might
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at if based on your
 
01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:37.140 align:start position:0%

01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
so chairman Pearson if it uh is the
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
pleasure of this committee you have had
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh as you're standing operating
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
procedure and it's worked out fairly
 
01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:18.290 align:start position:0%
procedure and it's worked out fairly
well

01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to scheduling and
 
01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
avoiding conflicts with the fiscal
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
committee to meeting on the fourth
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
Friday of the month and the meetings uh
 
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
typically start at 10 in the morning if
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
there is a conflict that does arise that
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
this group meets at one in the afternoon
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
seems to be a good process good system
 
01:24:40.729 --> 01:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
so if that's something for your
 
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
consideration you'd like to continue
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
that would mean the next regular meeting
 
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
of this committee would be tentatively
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
Friday February 24th at 10. can you tell
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
us what's on the agenda
 
01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
tentatively on the agenda which is
 
01:24:58.850 --> 01:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
driven by various statutory and chapter
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
law reporting requirements would include
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
um well I'll start one with one that is
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
neither of those very important however
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
is the update from our commissioner our
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
interim commissioner Lori Weaver as
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
she'd mentioned she'll be able to
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
provide more details around the roadmap
 
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
and other updates that are critical for
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
this committee to here in addition to
 
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
that tentatively we have under Senate
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 147 from 2021 a final report on the
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
spend down requirements our agency has
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
conducted educational opportunities
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
within our agency for those Frontline
 
01:25:36.729 --> 01:25:36.739 align:start position:0%
workers to be
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
better educated for uniformed
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
application of the spend under
 
01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:42.780 align:start position:0%
requirement particularly as it relates
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
to mental health delivery of services
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
you had an interim report uh Karen
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
Hebert our division director I know
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
Hebert our division director and also
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
Don Tierney formerly Landry were the
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
ones who presented I would expect that
 
01:25:59.570 --> 01:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
they would be presenting as well for
 
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
their final report in addition to that
 
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
there is also a statutorily driven
 
01:26:09.050 --> 01:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
report under RSA 128 11 that falls under
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
the health officer statutes for an
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
annual report from the health officers
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
again these are tentative and also
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
subject to additional items from through
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
your chair through you through the chair
 
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
for items that this committee might have
 
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
a particular interest in
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if the committee
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
would like to hear something that is not
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
on the tentative agenda please let me
 
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
know as soon as possible so we can line
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
up the uh people to speak I want to give
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
the committee an update before we close
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
last fall I formed two special
 
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
subcommittees one was on emerging
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies let me give you
 
01:26:51.709 --> 01:26:51.719 align:start position:0%
very briefly the history of that
 
01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
the late and much beloved Catherine
 
01:26:57.050 --> 01:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
Rogers sent a bill to Health and Human
 
01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:00.860 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs committee
 
01:27:03.729 --> 01:27:03.739 align:start position:0%
on that broad topic
 
01:27:07.090 --> 01:27:07.100 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
01:27:10.090 --> 01:27:10.100 align:start position:0%
convinced us it would be the best thing
 
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
to send it here
 
01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:15.060 align:start position:0%
it could happen faster
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
and to send it to this committee and
 
01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
form a subcommittee and come up with a
 
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
report and go from there and
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative soloway did this I
 
01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:29.219 align:start position:0%
appointed a subcommittee that he chaired
 
01:27:29.219 --> 01:27:31.310 align:start position:0%
appointed a subcommittee that he chaired
they

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
um came up with a report
 
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
and that report turned into a bill and
 
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
we will be looking at the emerging
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
medical Technologies Bill uh very soon
 
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
so that's the update on that that's the
 
01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:47.149 align:start position:0%
so that's the update on that that's the
story

01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm sorry
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know details but I
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
think it's coming to your committee
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
the other one representative Solway has
 
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
a family member who works for the i-team
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
Spotlight team of the Boston Globe and
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
gave me a heads up about
 
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
front page continued inside on four
 
01:28:17.209 --> 01:28:17.219 align:start position:0%
complete pages that a particular surgeon
 
01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:18.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
his malpractice company has settled 20
 
01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
malpractice cases against him
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that was reported on the website of
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts Board of Medicine but
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
was not reported on the website of the
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Medicine even
 
01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
though that surgeon practiced here
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
and so representative soloing again
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
um retired epidemiologist retired member
 
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services elderly
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
Affairs committee retired member of this
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
group suggested a subcommittee which he
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
insisted I chair on the issue of
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
transparency at the New Hampshire Board
 
01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
of Medicine that subcommittee met on
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
October 3rd 17th and 31st we had lots of
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
people on board some of them I'm looking
 
01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
at we took testimony and we came up with
 
01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of tentative conclusions
 
01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
one was that perhaps
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some changes in the
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
protocol as to what gets reported on the
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
website it may well be the case that the
 
01:29:26.689 --> 01:29:26.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Board of Medicine did
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong they were operating under
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
different rules than the board in
 
01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts operates under but we
 
01:29:34.729 --> 01:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
don't know that and what we are looking
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
at is should the rules be continued or
 
01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
should they be changed the second
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion we came up with is that the

01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
volunteer physician investigating and
 
01:29:54.250 --> 01:29:54.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps there could be
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
greater Staffing of this when complaints
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
are made this is no fault of the one
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
who's doing it on his own dime this is
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
simply saying there may need to be more
 
01:30:10.010 --> 01:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh representative ulery filed a bill I
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
was co-sponsor of it it was heard by
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
Edna that some funds at oplc office of
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
all of the funds they receive from
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
licenses after their expenses all the
 
01:30:27.169 --> 01:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
leftover money goes into the general
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
fund could some of that be non-lapsing
 
01:30:33.169 --> 01:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
that is to say they get to keep some so
 
01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
that they seeing a need could have
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
already hired additional staff does that
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
have to wait for the next budget cycle
 
01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
that Bill's been heard in Eda and will
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
come to the floor
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
where I wish to go forward with this
 
01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
transparency yes there is a bill that
 
01:30:54.350 --> 01:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
will re-establish basically the
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee it will look at rules and
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
regulations it will also periodically
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
oversee Board of Medicine to make sure
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
the rules are being followed that's a
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
bill that will be coming up in health
 
01:31:10.330 --> 01:31:10.340 align:start position:0%
and human services and I'm Prime sponsor
 
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
while that is running its slow course
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
along the way to being established
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
probably over the summer late fall I
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
will be pulling together just as an
 
01:31:23.689 --> 01:31:23.699 align:start position:0%
individual I'm not convinced yet that I
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
want to establish another subcommittee
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
but I do want to have some conversations
 
01:31:31.490 --> 01:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
so should the bill establishing a Board
 
01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:33.540 align:start position:0%

passed and signed into law we a lot of
 
01:31:39.169 --> 01:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
