are not be based solely on parents
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
agreeing to vaccinate the child using
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
current exemptions the concern is when
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
which parent should the decision rely on
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
when the parents disagree
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
especially in divorce parenting where
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
conflicts exist and at all times those
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
conflicts have a detrimental effect on a
 
00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.150 align:start position:0%
conflicts have a detrimental effect on a
child

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't state that anymore
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
the issue with with
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
the issue with
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
which parent has that
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
effect is for an example uh
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
signing up your child for football when
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
one parent believes that it's it's
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
detrimental to the child's health
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
one child believes that the game would
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
improve the overall mental health and
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
confidence of the child at which at
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
which parent
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
would these decisions go to
 
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.509 align:start position:0%
would these decisions go to
now

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
i know in children of family law
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
committee has always looked at bills
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
that would not create conflict
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
and for that reason i asked the house to
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
oppose the motion of ought to pass thank
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%

um i have to disagree uh with the
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
minority that this will create conflict
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
the only conflict that this is talking
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
about is between the parents and the
 
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
about is between the parents and the
state

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
that vaccination status shall not be
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
used by the state as a reason to
 
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
used by the state as a reason to
terminate

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
terminate
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
parental rights and
 
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:23.910 align:start position:0%
parental rights and

um
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
you know there's valid reasons medical
 
00:14:26.399 --> 00:14:27.590 align:start position:0%

someone may choose to not or change the
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
schedule of vaccinations and so those
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
parents should
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
not lose the
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
custody of their kids because of those
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
the question before us is
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
the majority report about to pass as
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%

00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%

you guys have it the committee report is
adopted

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee on children
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
and family law to which was referred
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 1286 and act relative to the
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
modification of parental rights and
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities having considered the
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
same report the same with the following
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
resolution resolved that is inexpedient
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
senator joshua keller for the majority
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee having
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
considered the same
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
being unable to agree with the majority
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
report with the recommendation that the
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill ought to pass representation of
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
deborah altschule or for the minority of
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
the committee the chair recognizes
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative altrueller for
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1286 is a language change
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
to rsa
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
461a11 which is part of our chapter on
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
which says the court may issue an order
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
modifying a permanent order concerning
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
 
00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.150 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
under

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
any of the following circumstances
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
and then the law goes on to outline a
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
nine part list of those circumstances
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
the change proposed here
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
would make the word make the beginning
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
of that title read the court may issue
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
an order modifying a permanent order
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
concerning parental rights and
 
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.710 align:start position:0%
concerning parental rights and
responsibilities

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
only under the following circumstances
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
and then again refer to that exhaustive
 
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.470 align:start position:0%
and then again refer to that exhaustive
list

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
of nine circumstances
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
we would think that um
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
this would be such a minor change that
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this have been sorted out
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
earlier in the courts
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
and yet the courts have asked us to do
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
exactly this because lower courts have
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
found ways to rule outside the scope of
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
that list the court may issue an order
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
modifying a permanent order concerning
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
parental rights and responsibilities
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
under the following circumstances and
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'll summarize them as this that both
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
parents agree to that modification
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
that the court finds
 
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
repeated intentional and unwarranted
 
00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.070 align:start position:0%
repeated intentional and unwarranted
interference

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
interference
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
by one parent with the residential
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the other parent
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
the court may then intervene without
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily showing harm to the child
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
because the court determines
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
that such a change would be in the best
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
interest of the child third the court
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
finds by clear and convincing evidence
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
the high standard that the child's
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
present environment is detrimental to
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
that child's physical mental or
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
emotional health
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
if the parties have substantially equal
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
periods of residential responsibility
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
for that child and either asserts that
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
the court finds the original allocation
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
of parental rights and response
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is not working
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
if the court finds by clear and
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that a minor child
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
is of sufficient maturity to make a
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
sound judgment that the court
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
may give substantial weight to their
 
00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:42.630 align:start position:0%
may give substantial weight to their
preference

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
preference
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
if the modification
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
makes either a minimal change or no
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
change at all in the allocation of
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
parenting time between the parents the
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
court could determine that that will be
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the child
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
and there are five more which i will not
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
go on with today but it is an exhaustive
 
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
go on with today but it is an exhaustive
list

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
when it was written in 2005
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently modified five
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
additional times by the legislature the
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
intention was to list
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
every possible issue that would arise to
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
necessitate changing a previously
 
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.510 align:start position:0%
necessitate changing a previously
permanent

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%

parent
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
parenting order
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
petitions to change permanent parenting
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
orders that are outside the scope of
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
this very comprehensive list continue
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
two lower court decisions modifying
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
parenting pans out parenting plans
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of that list
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
were then overturned by the new
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
once in 2019 december fourth of two of
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
2009 i'm sorry
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
that which is the much more case and in
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
2007 the larue case
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
in larue
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
the most recent of these overturns by
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
the court observed that the legislature
 
00:20:12.559 --> 00:20:13.990 align:start position:0%
the court observed that the legislature
intended

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
intended
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
contract principles to apply in
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
determining whether the parties have
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
agreed to a modification pursuant to the
 
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.470 align:start position:0%
agreed to a modification pursuant to the
statute

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
indicating that the first steps to a
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
limitation in the court's power to alter
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
a parenting plan the ability will or
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
resources needed to appeal a lower court
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
decision to the supreme court is
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
available to all citizens
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
and the court has made clear on at least
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
two occasions that a legislative fix to
 
00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
the language of rsa
 
00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:48.710 align:start position:0%
the language of rsa
6461a

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
6461a
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
is needed
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
to better serve the best interests of
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
children and her and their parents we
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
believe that rsa
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
that the rsa that currently reads the

be changed to reflect the direction

given to us by the courts
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%

the vote in committee was eight to seven

we ask you to please push the red button
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%

this
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
this language went to the supreme court
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
and they interpreted that the list is
 
00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:49.750 align:start position:0%
and they interpreted that the list is
exhaustive

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
exhaustive
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
so this change is not necessary that is
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
the current state of the law in new
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire and so this bill is just
 
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
paperwork trying to clarify something
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
that the state has already clarified
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
it's not going to change policy in the
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and so it's just
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
busy work
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
for the legislature and so i
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
the majority report of
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
division has been requested members will
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
and make sure you've turned on your
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:35.029 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative long
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that adding
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
simplifying the statute by adding the
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
only word would make it clearer for
 
00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.029 align:start position:0%
only word would make it clearer for
litigants

00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
litigants
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
then would i press the red button
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
if i know that the proposed change this
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
bill asks for is already correctly
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
interpreted by the supreme court
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
therefore totally unnecessary
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
then i will be pressing the green button
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%

before i get into this bill if if
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
everybody would give me their attention
 
00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
for a minute
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
um if if you know you're going to have a
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
request a division or a roll call
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
i request that you please let us know so
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
that we can go into the same system as
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
we did last thursday where i'll announce
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
the last speaker
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then we'll pretty much go right into
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
the vote to save as much time as
 
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
the vote to save as much time as
possible

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
last last thursday we it went very well
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i think if we do the same thing this
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
week will be the same way
 
00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:04.070 align:start position:0%
week will be the same way
and

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
just so
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
everybody knows
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
i apologize for sitting down but
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
i took a pretty good fall on the ice on
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
sunday myself so i'm
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
not in that good of shape either so um
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
i'll probably be sitting down a good
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee on
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
children and family law to which was
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
referred house bill 1305
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
an act relative to the temporary to
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony having considered the
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
same report the same with the
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
pass president of josh o'calla for the
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
having considered the same would be
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
another degree with the majority report
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
with the following resolution resolved
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
that is inexpedient to legislate
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
representative cassandra levesque for
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee the chair
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative levesque to
 
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr speaker
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony is meant to be just
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
that temporary
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
it is meant to be put into place while
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
the divorce is being processed it is not
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
meant to be a long-term solution
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
temporary alimony is available to
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
spouses who need financial assistance
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
during the divorce process in order to
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
cover living expenses and is separate
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
from temporary child support payments
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
when alimony is decided it takes time
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
for the court to consider and calculate
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
all assets to determine if alimony will
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
be part of the
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
divorce decree
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
the courts must also consider if the
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
requesting spouse lacks sufficient
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
income property or both to be
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
financially independent considering the
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
spouse's marital lifestyle
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
they also have to consider if the
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
recipient is unable to be
 
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
self-supporting through employment at a
 
00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
standard that meets reasonable needs or
 
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
standard that meets reasonable needs or
is

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
custodial parent to a child who needs
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
make it impossible for the parent to
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
work outside the home once the court
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
determines that support is needed it
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
will then decide the duration and amount
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
of alimony depending on the length of
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
the marriage and several other factors
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
this bill will make these steps more
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
difficult and not give the parties an
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
equal opportunity to calculate their
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
assets the courts need time when making
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
these calculations and this bill takes
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
away that needed time thank you mr
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
speaker and i will not yield to any
 
00:29:50.399 --> 00:29:53.990 align:start position:0%
speaker and i will not yield to any
questions

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
chair i recognize the representative
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
so currently
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh for temporary alimony there is no
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
requirement that they follow the normal
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
cal alimony calculations
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
that temporary alimony doesn't go
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
towards the time
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to be paying alimony and
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
so all this does is
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
say why are we why are we using a
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
different calculation than we normally
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
would and why aren't we counting the
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
money that you pay as part of the time
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
that you have to pay
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
and there is an exception if there is
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
shown irreparable harm from following
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
this process
 
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.990 align:start position:0%
this process
um

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the legislation so i hope that you
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%

00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
as the norm
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
supporters of this bill have said that
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse or criminal assault are
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
rebuttable factors
 
00:38:00.079 --> 00:38:01.589 align:start position:0%
rebuttable factors
however

00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
the standard of this bill though
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
establishes a blanket presumption of one
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
size fits all
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
until it doesn't doesn't could be lethal
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
we know this
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
that is not a child-centered policy
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
the minority of this committee believes
 
00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire current statute that
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
uses the best interest of the child
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
as a presumption
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
is effective
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
and house bill 1382
 
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes that
 
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.550 align:start position:0%
jeopardizes that
respectfully

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
so members take your seats we're down to

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
i agree with a lot of the sentiments
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
expressed by the other speaker
 
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.870 align:start position:0%
expressed by the other speaker
that

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
children do best when they have both
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
parents having an active role in their
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
children's lives unless
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
that role is deemed to be
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
hazardous and in the amended language
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.390 align:start position:0%
there is a
uh

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%

place

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
in that language that the that the judge
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
decides whether or not it is appropriate
 
00:39:40.829 --> 00:39:40.839 align:start position:0%
for the child to have
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
continued relationships with both
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
parents and if they
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
are if those kids are
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
better served by having continued
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
relationships with both parents then
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
it is the majority
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee's opinion that that be
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of
 
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.950 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of
of

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
to be parented by both parents and so i
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
hope that you will vote this
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
majority report about to pass as amended
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1382
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
if i know that the current parents
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities chapter
 
00:41:01.359 --> 00:41:03.270 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities chapter
461-a

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
461-a
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
centers its policy on the belief that
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
children do best when both parents have
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
a stable and meaningful involvement in
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
and if i know that defining shared
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
parenting as an automatic default to a
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
specific percentage of residential time
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
without actually defining residential
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
time is a gap in this bill
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
and if i know that many parents who need
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
court involvement in their custody and
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
parenting plan have high conflict
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
relationships where domestic abuse is
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
present and is a danger to children's
 
00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.309 align:start position:0%
present and is a danger to children's
safety

00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
then would i now press the red button so
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
another motion can be
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
made recognizes representative nelson

thank you mr speaker
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that shared
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
parenting offers families the benefits
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
of both parents building relationships
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
with their kids
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
encouraging healthy child development
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%

collaborate efforts for their children's
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
well-being and if i believe that this
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
bill as amended presumes shared custody
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
where a relationship with both parents
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
is found by the court to be in the best
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
interest of the child
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that this bill as
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
amended addresses the concerns expressed
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%

00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
people have rights that are enumerated
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
in the constitution of the united states
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
and the state of new hampshire and
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
declared as unalienable
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
however these rights are being infringed
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
upon with increasing frequency in recent
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
years we are constantly provided
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
examples of bad things people do and
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
then there's a large contingency of
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
people who want to punish those who
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
haven't done those things because some
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
people did bad things for example we
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
constantly have to fight off attempt to
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
take away our firearms
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
because some people choose to use
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
firearms for nefarious purposes
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
now there's an escalating push to remove
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
the recognized inalienable rights of
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
parents over their children all because
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
some parents may be lousy parents
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
parents are told they shouldn't be
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
allowed to make decisions about their
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
children's education just look at the
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
effort to prevent education freedom
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
accounts in school choice
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
parents are told they don't have the
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
right to interfere with
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me with their children's
 
00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
decisions about their medical care look
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
at the efforts to allow children to
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
obtain various medical treatments
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
without parental permission
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
parents are even losing custody of their
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
young children because they oppose these
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
decisions even the ones made by their
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
very young children
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
parents are being treated as domestic
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
terrorists for questioning anyone in a
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
position of authority
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1431 sends the message to
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
anyone who might not understand this or
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
might think otherwise but children
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
belong to their parents and parents have
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
the fundamental right to determine the
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
care and upbringing of their children
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
and these rights are inalienable
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
at a time when the parents of new
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire are wondering where we stand
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
passing house bill 1431 would say to
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
them loud and clear parents we stand
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
and although this bill explains the
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
rights of parents this one bill is truly
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative long
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
because the court did not side with them
 
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
so now two loving parents with the best
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
interests of the child are made to be in
 
00:54:45.119 --> 00:54:46.549 align:start position:0%
interests of the child are made to be in
conflict

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
what does this do divorce or separated
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
parents it rants up their ability to
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
conflict with one another i do recognize
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
that any conflict with parents is a
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
strain on the child and that's my main
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
concern here is the children
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
the bill also contains language in part
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
that reads all parental rights are
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
retained without obstruction or
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
interference from the state or other
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
governmental entities does this include
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
department of education the new
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire general court federal law
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
i believe it does
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
this bill weighs heavily on parental
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
rights specific to school districts
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
which are rights currently in statute in
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
total in testimony it was made clear
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
that some school districts currently
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
post the information being requested on
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
their website
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
so these this this is for those that
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
that for whatever reason are not putting
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
this information which is already in
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
statute uh to
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
to mandate that they do that
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
to put those districts that aren't
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
putting it on their website to put on a
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
website so again it's it's it's a it's a
 
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
website so again it's it's it's a it's a
duplication

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
duplication
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
and in my mind does this language create
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
a need for interpretation and
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
clarification on the current statutes
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
once this bill is passed
 
00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
this bill contains a clause that would
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
create disciplinary action toward a
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
trust a trusted adult of a child i agree
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
that no adult should be encouraged
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
a child not to speak with their parents
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
however children often depend on trusted
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
adults in helping them through fast
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
changing times in their life whether
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
they be teachers coaches or mentors the
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
concerns are with the trusted adult not
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
wanting to speak to a student a fear of
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
retaliation for disciplinary action
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
although this bill contains exemptions
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
as it does
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
not authorize a parent to abuse or
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
neglect their child has defined in rsa
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
169c the concern is with all parental
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
rights is retained without obstruction
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
or interference from state or
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
governmental entities
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
does that mean dcyf is it dcyf have to
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
come out with a finding before they
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
could interfere or does the court have
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
to come out with a finding before it
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
could be interfered
 
00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.430 align:start position:0%
could be interfered
so

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.549 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
could a parent not have
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
have to cooperate with dcyf or or the
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
court for that matter so in summary the
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
minority believes house bill 1431 will
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
have enough
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
it will not have the effect that people
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
are looking to change and that also this
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill is detrimental to the health and
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
welfare of children thank you mr speaker

i
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
this this bill
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
addresses a lot of the concerns that we
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony which is that there
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
parents and the state it's not between
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
parents this is only about the parents
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
between the parent between the parents
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
and the state where
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
the the state is trying to
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
keep information from the parents so
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
that they are not able to adequately
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
parent their kids and so this
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
asks that those uh like the school board
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
to come with with policies to to
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
be able to inform parents about how they
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
can be an active participant
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
how they can inspect district
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
instructional materials and
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
assessment results
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
and um it also
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
requires that state and political
 
00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.349 align:start position:0%
requires that state and political
officials

00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
officials
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
the school district and school
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
administrative unit
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
shall not encourage or
 
00:58:58.319 --> 00:58:59.430 align:start position:0%
shall not encourage or
attempt

00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
attempt
 
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:01.109 align:start position:0%
attempt
to

00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
coerce the
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
minor to withhold information from their
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
parents where the parent is not
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
under investigation or not suspected of
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
committing a crime against those kids so
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
they're not encouraging or putting up a
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
roadblock in between the parents and the
 
00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.030 align:start position:0%
roadblock in between the parents and the
kids

00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.390 align:start position:0%
kids
and

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
we worked on this and that hopefully
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
this this will you know there's a lot of
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
concerns from parents we heard a lot of
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
testimony on this especially with
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
schools and and the communication with
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
the schools and so this
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill encourages each school board school
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
district and administrative school unit
 
00:59:42.319 --> 00:59:44.309 align:start position:0%
district and administrative school unit
to

00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
have a policy to pro to promote parental
 
00:59:50.549 --> 00:59:50.559 align:start position:0%
involvement in the public school system
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
so i hope you will
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
support this as amended thank you
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%

bill 1431
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
if i know that as well intended as many
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
believe this legislation to be
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
that the rights enumerated within
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
are already part of federal and state
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
statutes the department of education's
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
administrative directives
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
and many school board policies therefore
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
making this legislation redundant and
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
not necessary
 
01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
and that parents who believe that their
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
rights have been violated already have
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
well established legal remedies
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
to address their
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
grievances but more so mr speaker if i
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
know as a former high school teacher of

trafficked
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
these examples are just a small window
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
into the reasons someone could make a
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
report because they are deeply concerned
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
for a child
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
as our law states reports made under
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
this statute
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
are presumed to be done in good faith
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
and can be done with anonymity
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
the committee received testimony that
 
01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.269 align:start position:0%
the committee received testimony that
sometimes

01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
those reports come from right inside the
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
house where the abuse is happening
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
victims trapped in domestic violence
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
make reports to dcyf
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%

01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
their children
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
reports come from grandparents who have
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
witnessed abuse on their grandchildren
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
many people experiencing domestic
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
violence at home have made reports about
 
01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
their own family members
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would take the anonymity away
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
from those people seeking help
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
potentially endangering them further
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
worse still it will stop people from
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
making reports all together for fear of
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
potentially lethal retribution from the

it's not anonymous forever
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
this bill inserts chilling language that
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
gives abusers permission
 
01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
and gives abusers leverage to sue people

some of the language in this bill
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
would require the child protection

made maliciously
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
what's not in this legislation
 
01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
is who makes that determination
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
it isn't clearly defined in this
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
language it's just hanging out there
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%

empowered and required by law

domestic abuse
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%

01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
be situationally deaf
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
because now that abuser could come after
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
them too

college
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
will now have to weigh the possibility
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
of also being abused by that child's
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
abuser through a civil court process
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
and the most terrifying
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
the threat
 
01:12:40.229 --> 01:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
that an adult on the receiving end of

violent abuse who tries to use the dcyf

reporting line to help them protect
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
their own children
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
may now also have to fear that they will
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
be blamed not believed or further
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%

imperative

imperative
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we recognize the co-occurrence of

child abuse and domestic violence
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation could potentially place
 
01:13:11.669 --> 01:13:11.679 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
i rise in support of
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
16 12 as amended
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
i have to disagree with the previous
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
speaker on many of the points as they
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
were addressed by the amendment
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
um the amendment
 
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
that we have adopted says that reports
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
to the department may
 
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.830 align:start position:0%
to the department may
be

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
include the name it does not say shall
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
so therefore the anonymous reporting is
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
still possible and so
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
i disagree with that statement and i
 
01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
also disagree with the statement that
 
01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
the people's information can be released
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
in uh court unless if in cases where
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
they haven't been um
 
01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:54.149 align:start position:0%
they haven't been um
uh

01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
they made the the um
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
the complaint in
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh good faith now read directly from the
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
bill under no circumstance
 
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.310 align:start position:0%
bill under no circumstance
shall

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
shall
 
01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
the identity of the complaint
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
plainland who makes the report of a
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
suspected uh abuse or neglect in good
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
faith or pursuing pursuant to rsa 169c
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
colon 29 shall be released
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i just disagree with pretty much
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
everything that the previous speaker
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
said and i hope that you will agree with
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
me and vote this bill ought to pass as
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%

01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
every person in new hampshire over the
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
age of 18 is mandated to report if they
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
suspect child abuse and neglect
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
and as the law states that such reports
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
are presumed to be made in good faith
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
if i further know mr speaker that many
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
people who experience domestic violence
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
have made anonymous reports against
 
01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
family members
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
and that this bill would take away their
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
anonymity thus potentially endangering
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
them further worse still
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
it would stop abused people from making
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
reports altogether for fear of potential
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
retribution from their abusers
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i believe that this bill
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
has dangerous implications
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
for the protection of abused children
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
good morning mr speaker and colleagues
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
i rise to speak against the interim
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
steady motion
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
i realize there isn't a great deal of
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
difference between the two motions of
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
interim study and inexpedient to
 
01:20:12.159 --> 01:20:13.750 align:start position:0%
interim study and inexpedient to
legislate

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
having an insurance background however i
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
usually take the opportunity to inform
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
anyone who will listen as to how
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
insurance work
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
works as it's a mystery to so many
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
insurance is for the sudden and
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
unexpected occurrence
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
the premium pays for the underwriting
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and mostly for
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
paying claims
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
the premiums of the many pay the claims
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
of the few
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
the premiums are based on the cost to
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
provide insurance coverage not to
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
determine competency or compliance with
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
state regulations
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
this bill would study the multitude of
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
licenses that are regulated by the state
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of replacing a license
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
with a mandatory minimum limit of inch
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
liability liability insurance
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
liability is roughly equivalent to
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
negligence which would need to be
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
present for a claim to be paid if bodily
 
01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
injury or property damage occurs
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
insurance only pays for the resulting
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
loss and does not cover workmanship
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
as the chair of our committee often
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
states we give people licenses so we can
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
take them away when they do something
 
01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.910 align:start position:0%
take them away when they do something
wrong

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
so if there are regulatory bodies that
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
review license applications for
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
competency and compliance with statutes
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
would insurance be an adequate
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
substitute for determining competency
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
an electrician
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
would we want to if for an electrician
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
we would want to eliminate that
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
licensing requirement and just replace
 
01:21:44.629 --> 01:21:44.639 align:start position:0%
it with an insurance policy for twenty
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
the electrician wires a home and the
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
home burns down due to negligence
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
the most the insurance policy will pay
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
is twenty five thousand dollars plus
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
defense costs
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
would the state have any obligation for
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
further action under this proposal to
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
replace licensing with insurance
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
if this was a requirement there would
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
have to be a significant increase in
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
premiums which i doubt is the purpose of
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
if the purpose of this bill is to reduce
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
the number of licenses required by the
 
01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.550 align:start position:0%
the number of licenses required by the
state

01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
another action should be taken than to
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
require a mandatory insurance policy
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
i won't belabor the point but i ask you
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
to consider opposing the interim study
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
so a motion of inexpedient to legislate
 
01:22:30.149 --> 01:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
could be brought forward and thanks for
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%

and environmentally friendly and if i
know

01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
that many homeowners associations are
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
operating under documents

unenforceable
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%

enabling
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
and not a mandate
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
and that would just open the door for
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
owners in homeowners associations who
 
01:27:55.110 --> 01:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
own their own buildings

01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
we were assured at the hearing that
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
internet service providers hadn't yet
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
given away your browsing history
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
passwords personal information bandwidth
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
usage statistics and the number of
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
connected devices in your home yet

i'm currently studying cyber security
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
and contrary to the majority report
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
internet service providers definitely do
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
have access to the internet traffic
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
about you your home and everything

related to your i p and mac addresses
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
again we are told not to do anything
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
about these potential abuses because no
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
one knows
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
about actual abuses yet do we wait for
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
crimes to happen before we legislate
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
against them do we wait for bridges to
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
collapse before we repair them do we
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
wait for inflation to get out of control
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
before we tighten down on the money
 
01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.350 align:start position:0%
before we tighten down on the money
supply

01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
supply
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
do we wait until aids kills 800 000
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
americans before implementing harm
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
reduction measures
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
well yes but the right thing to have
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
done would have been to prevent these
 
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
problems before they had occurred red

most interesting debate we're going to
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
hear all week would i now press the
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay house
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
bill 1503 on the table this is a roll
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
call vote

press the red button voting stations are
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
of all members president had an
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
149 having voted in the affirmative 188
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the negative the motion the table
 
01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:13.430 align:start position:0%
and the negative the motion the table
fails

01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
the member from manchester
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
representative herbert is recognized to
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:55.750 --> 01:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i rise in
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to the
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
proposed bill
 
01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.430 align:start position:0%
proposed bill
um

01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's really a pretty dramatic
 
01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.109 align:start position:0%
it's really a pretty dramatic
vote

01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
today i would i would think this is
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
maybe the most dramatic vote of the
 
01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:10.390 align:start position:0%
maybe the most dramatic vote of the
house

01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
house
uh

01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
in this session
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh the bill uh
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
wants to establish
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
a bitcoin
 
01:44:19.199 --> 01:44:21.590 align:start position:0%
a bitcoin
cryptocurrency

01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
and legitimize it
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
and it and in as a result of that
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
it will change
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
banking that we know it westphalian
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
banking is what it's called
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that was where
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
the nation state
 
01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:44.950 align:start position:0%
the nation state
has

01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:47.270 align:start position:0%
has
sovereignty

01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
sovereignty
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency the cryptocurrency
 
01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:52.870 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency the cryptocurrency
ecology

01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
ecology
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
is based on secrecy
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
and anonymity
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
and as a result will be a direct
 
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.790 align:start position:0%
and as a result will be a direct
competitor

01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
competitor
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
to the banking establishment that we
 
01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.669 align:start position:0%
to the banking establishment that we
were

01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
that is almost 500 years old so it's not
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
a unimportant
 
01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.629 align:start position:0%
a unimportant
insignificant

01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
insignificant
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
the cryptocurrency ecology
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
is the preferred
 
01:45:20.239 --> 01:45:22.229 align:start position:0%
is the preferred
financial

01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:45:22.239 --> 01:45:23.430 align:start position:0%
financial
system

01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
for organized crime around the world
 
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
designed for that purpose
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
and it's very good at it as a matter of
 
01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.229 align:start position:0%
and it's very good at it as a matter of
fact

01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
it makes it very difficult
 
01:45:38.159 --> 01:45:39.109 align:start position:0%
it makes it very difficult
for

01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
enforce the law it's very difficult to
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
who's selling what and who's buying what
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
because secrecy is
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
is its calling card
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
um some promoters of the ecosystem
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
maintain that they there will eventually
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that would be a westphalian type of
 
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
thing where the there is a third party
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
that uh oversees and records
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
what goes on in the cryptocurrency
 
01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.229 align:start position:0%
what goes on in the cryptocurrency
environment

01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
but that is not a certain certainty that
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
is uh that is an opinion it's it's
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
normative it that is not a a positive
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
statement we don't know exactly how
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
and in fact there are a lot of
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
faults and weaknesses
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
that will
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
make it very very hard
 
01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:46.719 align:start position:0%
for us to have a public ledger
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
who's buying what and who's selling what
 
01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:55.990 align:start position:0%
who's buying what and who's selling what
and

01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
and what is what
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's the interesting thing the most
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
it was said that this is the wild west
 
01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.470 align:start position:0%
it was said that this is the wild west
they

01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
make that connection they say it's just
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
like the wild west only except this is
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
in finance
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's some accuracy
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
there but i think it falls short of
 
01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.070 align:start position:0%
there but i think it falls short of
actually

01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
telling us what the difficulties are
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency has a unique feature that
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
allows it to be
 
01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.709 align:start position:0%
allows it to be
everywhere

01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
and nowhere
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
so you can see the difficulties we were
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.310 --> 01:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a very very hard
 
01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:52.390 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a very very hard
pushback

01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
pushback
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
against this kind of legislation for the
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
reasons that people are concerned that
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
the nation state
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
the sovereignty of the nation state
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
will be compromised
 
01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:07.750 align:start position:0%
will be compromised
and

01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact the cryptocurrency
 
01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:11.669 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact the cryptocurrency
ecology

01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
ecology
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
is being used today
 
01:48:16.629 --> 01:48:16.639 align:start position:0%
to get around some of the sanctions
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
that the united states has put forward
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
on russia
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
and we can't do anything about it
 
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.350 align:start position:0%
and we can't do anything about it
because

01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
this cryptocurrency ecology
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
is well established around the world
 
01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:37.830 align:start position:0%
is well established around the world
so

01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
if the united states says well we don't
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to have the bitcoin china has
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
already done that that doesn't matter
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
there will be a mining facility and an
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
exchange facility put in another country
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
and already there is this this ecology
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
is very well established
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
i'm afraid i may be this may be the
 
01:48:59.350 --> 01:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
pandora's box
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
it's opened
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
and so now we have a situation where the
 
01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.390 align:start position:0%
and so now we have a situation where the
mon

01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
mon
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
the sovereignty of the united states
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
monetary system is going to be
 
01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:09.669 align:start position:0%
monetary system is going to be
compromised

01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
compromised
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
as will other nation
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
states so for that those reasons and
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of different reasons
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to that it's not as
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
foolproof as the 51 rule somebody can
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
actually get 51
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
of the bitcoin and that
 
01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
attack

01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
attack
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
any state
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
effort that might be made
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
so it's it's very problematic i think at
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
minimum it needs to be studied
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that it can't work
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying the concerns are real
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
and there are no answers that satisfy my
 
01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.390 align:start position:0%
and there are no answers that satisfy my
standards

01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
standards
 
01:49:59.830 --> 01:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
to put this into to legitimize this
 
01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
to put this into to legitimize this
particular

01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
put it on hold or don't pass it for
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
heaven's sake but
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
if i was the governor i would have fired
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
the banking commissioner by now
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
and let's list it needs to study
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
and i think we can do that
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can come up with something
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
that will actually
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
get the best
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
of bitcoin
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh without the compromises of uh ruining
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
the sovereignty of the nation states
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
normally i'd say no timmy but okay i'll
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
take it
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
you may inquire
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know i was just reading through the
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill and i'm curious if your
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
interpretation is the same as mine the
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
the plain text language in this bill
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
would seem to read like it would allow a
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
financial institution
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
to simply get involved with blockchain
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
stuff and exempt all of their operations
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
from these security laws that are cited
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't seem to only exempt their
 
01:51:23.430 --> 01:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
blockchain operations from the
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
securities laws so is there anything in
 
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation that's going to prevent
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
some other bank or day trader
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
or some other existing financial
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
institution from just selling a bitcoin
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
to exempt themselves from all of the
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
i would say that's possible
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of work that needs to be
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
done to tighten up
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh regulation to protect our sovereignty
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
here in the united states and any nation
 
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
here in the united states and any nation
state

01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
the westphalian system has been around
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
for five centuries
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
and it's not perfect
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
as we all know
 
01:52:06.159 --> 01:52:07.669 align:start position:0%
as we all know
banks

01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
banks
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
banks collapse and capitalists
 
01:52:13.629 --> 01:52:13.639 align:start position:0%
fall over and you know socialists get
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
authoritarian on us
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
you know so that there are a lot of
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
problems in in the banking system
 
01:52:22.470 --> 01:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
that exists today
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
but it has
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
gotten through
 
01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
five centuries bitcoin is significantly
 
01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:30.709 align:start position:0%
five centuries bitcoin is significantly
different

01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
than the system we have now
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not comfortable
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
with it at all
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
criminals are always way ahead of the
 
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.550 align:start position:0%
criminals are always way ahead of the
government

01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
when something new comes along
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to work a lot harder
 
01:52:53.189 --> 01:52:53.199 align:start position:0%
on this and
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
and not be so
 
01:52:57.270 --> 01:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
libertarian if you will
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
and see if we can't get something that
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
the member from seabrook representative
 
01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
abramson is recognized to speak in
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker house bill 1503 and
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
the language in it was discussed for a
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
long time at the universal
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
commerce commission our own uh
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
convention of the states that's held
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
every year in chicago
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
h.b 1503 would exempt holders of
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
blockchain tokens from certain
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
securities roles as they are not trading
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
in securities several other states are
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
moving including wyoming are moving
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
through similar legislation to attract
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
business holders of these keys similar
 
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
to the online safe deposit boxes
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
and we need to attract new business and
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
new industries by protecting new
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
startups from onerous regulations that
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
lenders currently face
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
after all these companies are not
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
lenders they don't have access to the
 
01:54:01.350 --> 01:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
contents of the blockchain and are
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
innovating in the field of protecting
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
bitcoin litecoin doggy coin and other
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
new technologies recently
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
coinbase has just announced that they
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
are now blocking access to over 25 000
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
russian coinbase accounts that means
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
that this foreign exchange site
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
has arbitrary power to take away
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
anyone's access to their own
 
01:54:21.119 --> 01:54:22.870 align:start position:0%
anyone's access to their own
cryptocurrency

01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
on a whim or even close off access to
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
altcoins that are used for other
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
purposes such as storing information
 
01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
patents official documents news articles
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
or proof of ownership or authorship
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
while new hampshire currently has no
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
applications for registered blockchain
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
tokens yet consumers clearly need more
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
options for this newly developed
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
technology than what is currently out
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
the member from plymouth representative
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
weston is recognized to speak against
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues i'm going to provide you with
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
some solid reasons to oppose this bill
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
as we amended it this morning
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
to respond to representative smith
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
i don't have trouble with the first part
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
of the amended bill which exempts the
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
blockchain token from security laws
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstances
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
but i do have a problem with the second
 
01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
part of the bill which is to adopt
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
article 12 of the uniform commercial
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
code known as the ucc
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
why do i object to this new article
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
because we don't know yet what's in it
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
in our committee hearings we were given
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
a draft which was drafted in december of
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i had some serious problems with
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
certain elements of that draft
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
even the uniform law commission the
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
group writing these laws admitted that
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
there were issues with the draft
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
amendment 0828 which we just voted on
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
includes updated rules from the ulc
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
and those were an improvement but those
 
01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
rules are still a draft
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
the commission is meeting again this
 
01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:06.229 align:start position:0%
the commission is meeting again this

01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
to work on the issue further and the
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
final product is promised to come
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
sometime this summer
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
so my question is what's the hurry
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but i would not
 
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
write a blank check nor would i sign a
 
01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
contract without reading it
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
meanwhile on february 9th governor
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
sununu submitted the executive order
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
establishing a commit a commission
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
on cryptocurrencies and digital assets
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
he's pulling in all the experts to
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
explore this complex issue
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
and the reports due out on august 8th
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's only five months from now
 
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
is it really appropriate for us to jump
 
01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:48.950 align:start position:0%
is it really appropriate for us to jump
ahead

01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
of that the results of that commission
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
then on march 9th just last week
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
president biden signed an executive
 
01:56:57.119 --> 01:56:58.070 align:start position:0%
president biden signed an executive
order

01:56:58.070 --> 01:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:56:59.990 --> 01:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
to call on the federal government in
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
coordination with the federal reserve
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
to examine the risks and benefits of
 
01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.430 align:start position:0%
to examine the risks and benefits of
cryptocurrencies

01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrencies
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
the measures in his upcoming study
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
focused on six key areas
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
consumer protection
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
financial stability
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
illicit activity
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
us competitiveness
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
financial inclusion
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
and responsible innovation
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
in our brief commerce hearings
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
we didn't touch on half of that
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more to consider here than
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
what we had in our brief commerce
 
01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.870 align:start position:0%
what we had in our brief commerce
hearings

01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't it be prudent for us to wait
 
01:57:42.629 --> 01:57:42.639 align:start position:0%
for these reports
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
they should be out this year they're
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing i wanted to mention is
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
that we're approaching the
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
78th anniversary of the bretton woods
 
01:57:57.119 --> 01:57:58.629 align:start position:0%
78th anniversary of the bretton woods
conference

01:57:58.629 --> 01:57:58.639 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm really proud that the american
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
dollar has maintained its role as a
 
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
standard for reserve currencies since
 
01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:07.589 align:start position:0%
standard for reserve currencies since
1944.

01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
1944.
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
i recognize that we need to establish
 
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:10.950 align:start position:0%
i recognize that we need to establish
rules

01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
to contain the threat of a second
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
currency in our economy
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
but right now i think we need to slow
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
down let the experts do their work and
 
01:58:23.589 --> 01:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
then proceed with caution
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
so please hit the red button
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
to stop this blind and premature
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
acceptance of an unfinished bill
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
final speaker
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
the member from new boston
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative amman is recognized to
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
five years ago i was before this body
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
talking about cryptocurrency and uh
 
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
saying it was going to be a big deal
 
01:58:58.070 --> 01:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to be as big a deal as the
 
01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.430 align:start position:0%
it's going to be as big a deal as the
internet

01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
internet
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
and you know maybe not many people
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
believed me back then but
 
01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:04.330 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
01:59:04.330 --> 01:59:05.830 align:start position:0%
you can see
[Music]

01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
our other speaker mentioned that the
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
governor issued an executive order
 
01:59:11.589 --> 01:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
the president of the united states
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
issued an executive order both to create
 
01:59:14.950 --> 01:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
a commission
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
to study so it is a big deal
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
implements the result of another
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
commission and it's called the uniform
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
law commission
 
01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
and they have a draft it's called
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
the uniform commercial code on emerging
 
01:59:35.679 --> 01:59:37.669 align:start position:0%
the uniform commercial code on emerging
technologies

01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
and this draft
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
the current bill is a glide path to
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
implement this
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
new article of the ucc
 
01:59:48.629 --> 01:59:48.639 align:start position:0%
we would be the first state to do it now
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
uniform commercial code
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
is designed to
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
help interstate commerce it's it's
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
state-level law that lots of states
 
01:59:57.599 --> 01:59:59.430 align:start position:0%
state-level law that lots of states
adopt

01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
rsa 382 of our new hampshire rsas we
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
have adopted articles one through nine
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
with the exception of article six which
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
is now obsolete
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
so article 12 is going to deal with new
 
02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:13.589 align:start position:0%
so article 12 is going to deal with new
technologies

02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
we're currently in something called the
 
02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
fourth industrial revolution you may
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
have heard of the industrial revolution
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
the first was steam and water power the
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
second was the locomotive
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
the telegraph and the electrification
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
the third was the digital revolution
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
with computers
 
02:00:32.709 --> 02:00:32.719 align:start position:0%
we're in the fourth
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
industrial revolution and
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
you may have heard the expression that
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
data is the new oil
 
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:40.950 align:start position:0%
data is the new oil
what

02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:42.149 align:start position:0%
what
what

02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
controllable electronic records
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
controllable electronic records it's
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
kind of an abstraction of multiple
 
02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:50.070 align:start position:0%
kind of an abstraction of multiple
things

02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what the uniform commercial
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
code article 12 deals with these are the
 
02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
building blocks
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the future of the global economy
 
02:01:00.790 --> 02:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
and they're things like digital assets
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
you've heard of cryptocurrencies
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
they're things like stable coins that
 
02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:05.510 align:start position:0%
they're things like stable coins that
are

02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:01:08.070 --> 02:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
tied to the u.s dollar the u.s dollar
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
currently is
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
represents 97 of all stable coins
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
so cryptocurrency is giving the u.s
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
dollar the biggest market
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
globally so it doesn't undermine the
 
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
dollar it actually enhances it
 
02:01:25.510 --> 02:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
you may have heard of nfts and
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
non-fungible tokens
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
electronic promissory notes so these are
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
things like smart contracts that can you
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
can automate
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
financial transactions
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
these are big topics i'm happy to talk
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
for hours with any of you uh
 
02:01:41.599 --> 02:01:43.030 align:start position:0%
for hours with any of you uh
afterwards

02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
02:01:45.109 --> 02:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind this is a trillion
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
dollar global industry
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
by new hampshire being the first to
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
adopt ucc article 12
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
we will be ahead of the pack will
 
02:01:54.159 --> 02:01:55.189 align:start position:0%
we will be ahead of the pack will
attract

02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
attract
 
02:01:57.669 --> 02:01:57.679 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs innovators
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
young young engineers that are
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
interested in this topic to our state
 
02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
and that is the benefit of adopting this
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
bill so i ask you to support
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
the the bill as amended and vote green

does the member yield for a question
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
i do
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
by any chance other countries have been
 
02:02:28.070 --> 02:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
using this currency already and they've
 
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
been benefiting from
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
even having a bitcoin city
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
are you talking about el salvador yes
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so the country of el salvador has
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh adopted bitcoin as
 
02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:43.669 align:start position:0%
uh adopted bitcoin as
uh

02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
in their legal tender laws so you can
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%

02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of complaint about uh
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
mining the mining process of bitcoin
 
02:02:55.750 --> 02:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
using electricity using too much energy
 
02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
but in el salvador they're actually
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
using geothermal energy from a volcano
 
02:03:03.189 --> 02:03:03.199 align:start position:0%
for this for the country to mine bitcoin
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
and they're developing bonds for the
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
country based on uh the output of that
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
mining is that what you're asking yes
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for answering
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
the question is on the majority
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
committee report about to pass as
 
02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%

02:03:30.709 --> 02:03:30.719 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
it is this will be a roll call vote
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
the house will come to order
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative fargo is recognized for

02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
if i know that understanding the
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
consequences of using cryptocurrency and
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
digital assets at a national and state
 
02:05:01.030 --> 02:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
level takes time and effort and that
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
these assets can be extremely volatile
 
02:05:06.629 --> 02:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
investment and with serious scalability
 
02:05:06.639 --> 02:05:08.069 align:start position:0%
investment and with serious scalability
issues

02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
and if i know the president signed an
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
executive order last wednesday to study
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
digital assets on a federal level while
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
the uniform commercial code or the ucc
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
council is still working on article 12
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
and will be making more changes when
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
they meet again in june
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
and if i know that we will have the
 
02:05:28.950 --> 02:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
report from the governor's commission in
 
02:05:31.589 --> 02:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
august a commission that was established
 
02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
to deal with these assets in a safe and
 
02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
responsible way so that new hampshire
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
can continue to advance necessary
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
reforms promote economic growth foster
 
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
innovation and meet the changing
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
customer needs while ensuring safety
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
soundness and consumer protection
 
02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:52.719 align:start position:0%
and finally if i know that passing this
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
legislation today is premature
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
we do not need to be first in the nation
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
on this technology
 
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
and an alternative solution of interim
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
study would allow us to have
 
02:06:06.629 --> 02:06:06.639 align:start position:0%
all the information from the federal
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
government the governor's commission and
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
the latest ucc amendments to enable us
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
to move forward progressively
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
then would i oppose the ought to pass as
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
amended by pressing the red button so we
 
02:06:20.159 --> 02:06:22.069 align:start position:0%
amended by pressing the red button so we
can

02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
representative edwards is recognized for
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
if i know that had i
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
followed the vision of our
 
02:06:38.950 --> 02:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative from new boston five
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
years ago i'd be
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:44.719 --> 02:06:45.669 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
if i knew that this bill would help put
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in the leader position and
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
these emerging financial technologies
 
02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:56.719 align:start position:0%
and that in turn
 
02:06:56.719 --> 02:06:57.750 align:start position:0%
and that in turn
would

02:06:57.750 --> 02:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
indicate to the world that new hampshire
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
is in fact seen as tech friendly
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
and that that would therefore create
 
02:07:10.390 --> 02:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
a new clean industry that would bring in
 
02:07:13.350 --> 02:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
new engineering and investor roles into
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
the state if i knew those things would i
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
green light
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
the question is the majority committee
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
report of octopass is amended
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor you'll be pressing
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
the green button if you're opposed
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
you'll be pressing the red button voting
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:46.560 --> 02:08:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
have all members present had an
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%

representative oregon's bill
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
hb 1583 hb 1583 would allow state liquor
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
stores to be open on easter sunday
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
christmas and thanksgiving
 
02:09:56.709 --> 02:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
and to open up right next to churches
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
chapels and parish houses
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
yet we were told at public hearings that
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
the liquor stores
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
can't find workers who will leave the
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%

02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
three hallow days of thanks prayer and

three hallow days of thanks prayer and
reflection

02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
reflection
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
an improbable and negligible amount of
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
state revenue did not seem reason enough
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
to open up liquor stores on the holiest
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
of days nor to disturb the quiet
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of families
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
who might not see each other
 
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
on the more hectic 362 days a year
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
if there's no revenue to be gained why
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
02:10:32.550 --> 02:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
what does it purport to accomplish

thank you mr speaker
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
as introduced this bill changes the
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
regulation on places of operation of the
 
02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
state liquor stores and allows state
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
liquor stores to be open on easter
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment replaces the
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
original bill and removes references to
 
02:11:50.790 --> 02:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
any one holiday
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
the current law allows the liquor
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
commission to open on holidays with the
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
agreement from the state employees
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
already working there
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
so removing actual days from the statute
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
seems more appropriate
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%

at one point 85 percent of arrests and
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
as many as incarcerated
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%

88 percent of those as we heard in
committee

02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
were black latino or american indian
 
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
most of these americans are in fact
 
02:22:17.429 --> 02:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
caged and forced to work for literal or
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
nothing literal literal slavery
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
my ancestors fought and died in the
 
02:22:25.429 --> 02:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
civil war to end black slavery yet it's
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
come back in this form of this insane
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
war on drugs incarceration of
 
02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
non-violent drug and gun offenders puts
 
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
poor and brown americans behind bars to
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
be used as actual prison slave labor
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
mr speaker as frederick douglass said
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
and as i have said on this floor many
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
times taxation of wages is slavery
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
taxing our constituents at the rate of
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
54 386 dollars per year per pot smoker
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
accomplishes nothing
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
but the breakdown in respect for the
 
02:22:55.030 --> 02:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
rule of law and the breakdown of our
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
families we cannot arrest our way out of
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
the member from dover representative
 
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
conley is recognized to speak against
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker colleagues i rise
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
against the motion of an expedient to
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
legislate new hampshire voters
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly support legalizing
 
02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:17.110 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly support legalizing
cannabis

02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
yet the legislature has failed to make
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
good on their wishes
 
02:23:21.750 --> 02:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would let voters decide
 
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not to legalize recreational
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis using the constitutional
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
amendment process
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
with a simple yes or no vote residents
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
could or could consider this simple
 
02:23:32.479 --> 02:23:34.150 align:start position:0%
could or could consider this simple
question

02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
all adults shall have the right to
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
possess cannabis intended for their
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
personal consumption that's it that's
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
what this would do
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
if it passes the issue would almost
 
02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
certainly come back to this chamber to
 
02:23:48.150 --> 02:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
set some reasonable guard rails for how
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
it would work
 
02:23:51.429 --> 02:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
if it fails we could put this issue to
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
rest once and for all for a few years
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
let's put it to voters and see what they
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:02.469 --> 02:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
representative abbas is recognized to
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
the last speaker
 
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll repeat myself
 
02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:12.790 align:start position:0%
and i'll repeat myself
this

02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
cacr cacr20 would allow
 
02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
any individual who granted the
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to possess as much
 
02:24:23.030 --> 02:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis as they want without any
 
02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:24.230 align:start position:0%
cannabis as they want without any
restriction

02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
02:24:25.990 --> 02:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
provided it's intended for its personal
 
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.190 align:start position:0%
provided it's intended for its personal
use

02:24:27.190 --> 02:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:24:29.190 --> 02:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
there's no definition of that it's just
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's how it is all the
 
02:24:33.830 --> 02:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
bills that we've worked very hard on in
 
02:24:36.309 --> 02:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan manner would all be deemed
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional we would have to start
 
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
over from scratch this would be a step
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
backwards and with that being said we
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
have two other caacrs to follow this on
 
02:24:46.389 --> 02:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
the same subject
 
02:24:46.399 --> 02:24:47.670 align:start position:0%
the same subject
cannabis

02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll say this time and carry it over
 
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
is the state constitution the best place
 
02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:54.230 align:start position:0%
is the state constitution the best place
to

02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:24:56.469 --> 02:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
put can't list cannabis or marijuana
 
02:24:56.479 --> 02:24:57.990 align:start position:0%
put can't list cannabis or marijuana
policies

02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:24:59.590 --> 02:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
i believe not
 
02:25:01.750 --> 02:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
so please join me and push the green
 
02:25:02.870 --> 02:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
button to support the committee's
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation of index being to
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
the question is on the majority
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%

02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%

02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
we've had a request for a division this
 
02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
will be a division vote members take
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
the house will come to order
 
02:26:25.429 --> 02:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
the question is on the majority com
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%

02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative espise speeches
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
if i believe that the issue of cannabis
 
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
has been discussed for for years now and
 
02:26:49.280 --> 02:26:50.230 align:start position:0%
has been discussed for for years now and
that

02:26:50.230 --> 02:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
it is popular amongst many of our
 
02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
it is popular amongst many of our
constituents

02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that
 
02:26:58.150 --> 02:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this bill
 
02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
our former colleague from from hampton
 
02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
worked incredibly hard on this issue for
 
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
so many years and
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
if i believe that
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
for i if i believe this is a steep issue
 
02:27:11.429 --> 02:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
to put it on the constitutional as a
 
02:27:14.469 --> 02:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment but that
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
it may be time to give it to the voters
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
then would i now vote to overturn the
 
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative apis is recognized for
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that
 
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that
cacr20

02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
cacr20
 
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
would allow any adult
 
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
which i presume is over the age of 18
 
02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't say 21 to possess an
 
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
unlimited amount of cannabis
 
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker lastly lastly if i know
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
that if the federal prohibition were to
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
ever be removed and i certainly hope it
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
does one day
 
02:27:50.399 --> 02:27:51.750 align:start position:0%
does one day
that

02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:54.230 --> 02:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
the likely age of regulation be 21
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
similar to alcohol and tobacco
 
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
and therefore this constitutional
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
amendment would conflict with
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
potential future federal law would i go
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
ahead and push that green button to
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
support the committee's recommendation
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%

in the negative the committee report is
adopted

majority on criminal

justice and public safety to which was
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
referred house bill 1096-fn
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
an act prohibiting open carrying or
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
display of a deadly weapon within 100
 
04:02:21.510 --> 04:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
feet of a polling place having
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
04:02:25.349 --> 04:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
the following resolution resolved that
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
is inexpedient to legislate
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
the senate of john burt for the majority
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
04:02:32.710 --> 04:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee
 
04:02:34.389 --> 04:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
having considered the same and being
 
04:02:36.229 --> 04:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
unable to agree with the majority report
 
04:02:37.590 --> 04:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
with the recommendation the bill ought
 
04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
to pass senator david muse for the
 
04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:45.189 --> 04:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative muse to
 
04:02:54.070 --> 04:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker let me start by
 
04:02:58.870 --> 04:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
saying that in this country i would hope
 
04:03:01.349 --> 04:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
we could agree that no american should
 
04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
ever be threatened with deadly weapons
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
either explicitly or implicitly
 
04:03:07.510 --> 04:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
while simply exercising their right to
 
04:03:07.520 --> 04:03:09.510 align:start position:0%
while simply exercising their right to
vote

04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately intimidation by armed
 
04:03:14.229 --> 04:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
individuals has long been a tool that
 
04:03:15.990 --> 04:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
some have used to prevent the full
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
participation by others in our u.s
 
04:03:18.399 --> 04:03:20.150 align:start position:0%
participation by others in our u.s
democracy

04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
04:03:22.630 --> 04:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
during and after reconstruction guns
 
04:03:24.630 --> 04:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
were often used to scare black voters
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
away at the polls
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
that history of armed voter intimidation
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
is not a distant memory
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
guns at the polls are a tinderbox near
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
an open flame
 
04:03:38.309 --> 04:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
in manchester during the november 2020
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
election an armed man harassed people
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
holding signs for candidates in the
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
election electioneering area
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
outside three separate polling places
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
in charlotte north carolina an armed man
 
04:03:52.710 --> 04:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
was arrested after a polling supervisor
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
asked him to leave a polling place on
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
election day and he returned
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
in lane county oregon armed individuals
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
approached voters as they were dropping
 
04:04:03.990 --> 04:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
off their ballots
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
hb 1096 is a simple proactive attempt to
 
04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
make our election safer for all of our
 
04:04:09.840 --> 04:04:11.510 align:start position:0%
make our election safer for all of our
citizens

04:04:11.510 --> 04:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
04:04:13.750 --> 04:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
this bill amends our current voter
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
intimidation statute to prohibit open
 
04:04:19.030 --> 04:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
carrying or display of a deadly weapon
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
within 100 feet of a polling place on
 
04:04:24.150 --> 04:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
the days where federal state and or
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
municipal elections are taking place
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
what the bill does not do is eliminate
 
04:04:32.070 --> 04:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
the right to self-defense
 
04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
there are exceptions in the bill for
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
voters and election officials who are
 
04:04:38.950 --> 04:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
legally carrying concealed weapons
 
04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
there are also exceptions for law
 
04:04:43.750 --> 04:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials and even pickup
 
04:04:45.830 --> 04:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
truck owners with shotguns or rifles
 
04:04:48.469 --> 04:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
secured in their gun racks
 
04:04:49.990 --> 04:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed because under
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
current law state and local authorities
 
04:04:55.110 --> 04:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
can't prevent people from bringing guns
 
04:04:59.189 --> 04:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
the supreme court of the united states
 
04:05:04.229 --> 04:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the supreme court of the
 
04:05:06.630 --> 04:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
united states said it best
 
04:05:08.389 --> 04:05:08.399 align:start position:0%
no right is more precious in a free
 
04:05:11.030 --> 04:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
country than of having a voice in the
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
election of those who make the laws
 
04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
under which we as good citizens must
 
04:05:15.520 --> 04:05:16.870 align:start position:0%
under which we as good citizens must
live

04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
live
 
04:05:18.150 --> 04:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
other rights
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
even the most basic are illusory if the
 
04:05:23.349 --> 04:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
right to vote is undermined
 
04:05:25.030 --> 04:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
however the fundamental right to vote
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
without fear intimidation vital to our
 
04:05:29.830 --> 04:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
democracy is endangered when we allow
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
deadly weapons to be displayed as an
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
implicit threat to others either inside
 
04:05:37.269 --> 04:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
or outside our polling places
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
in the heller decision justice antonin
 
04:05:41.670 --> 04:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
scalia wrote that while the second
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
amendment protects the right of law and
 
04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
abiding responsible citizens to use
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
to use arms in the defense of hearth and
 
04:05:53.349 --> 04:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
home he also wrote that nothing in this
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
opinion should be taken to cast doubt on
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
long-standing prohibitions on laws
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
forbidding the carrying of firearms in
 
04:06:03.750 --> 04:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive places such as schools or
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
government buildings
 
04:06:08.070 --> 04:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
several states including georgia have
 
04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
gone on to interpret sensitive places to
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
include polling places
 
04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that hb 1096
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't force us to choose between
 
04:06:21.590 --> 04:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
voting rights and second amendment
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
rights because it honors both
 
04:06:26.550 --> 04:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
the right to self-defense is still
 
04:06:26.560 --> 04:06:27.830 align:start position:0%
the right to self-defense is still
protected

04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
protected
 
04:06:30.070 --> 04:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing in this bill changes
 
04:06:32.070 --> 04:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
the right of voters or election
 
04:06:34.389 --> 04:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
officials to carry concealed weapons
 
04:06:36.630 --> 04:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
into polling places for self-defense
 
04:06:36.640 --> 04:06:37.990 align:start position:0%
into polling places for self-defense
purposes

04:06:37.990 --> 04:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
but one thing would change weapons would
 
04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to be displayed openly or
 
04:06:45.349 --> 04:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
near polling places where they have the
 
04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
very real potential to intimidate others
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
who are simply trying to exercise their
 
04:06:52.630 --> 04:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
right to vote
 
04:06:54.790 --> 04:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
i ask you to vote red to overturn the
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee recommendations so another
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
motion can be made and i ask for a
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's been a request for a roll call
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
before i get to the last speaker is that
 
04:07:12.389 --> 04:07:12.399 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this is
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
going to be a roll call vote
 
04:07:18.389 --> 04:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
members take your seats
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i rise in support
 
04:07:41.429 --> 04:07:41.439 align:start position:0%
of the committee's recommendation of
 
04:07:43.510 --> 04:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
index speeding to legislate
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
just to clarify we hear we often hear uh
 
04:07:47.510 --> 04:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
quotes from the supreme court and the
 
04:07:49.030 --> 04:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
heller decision
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
just to click just so everyone
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
understands in that case there was no
 
04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
discussion of new hampshire's article 2a
 
04:07:57.750 --> 04:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
which is many legal scholars believe is
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
much more
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
protective of firearm rights than the
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things i said last time
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
we were here about an exception for a
 
04:08:08.309 --> 04:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
pickup truck
 
04:08:11.110 --> 04:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
and not not being able to uh open carry
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
on your private property this bill
 
04:08:16.830 --> 04:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
hb 1096 contains the
 
04:08:19.110 --> 04:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
same issues
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
if you live adjacent to a place where
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
there is it's a polling station you can
 
04:08:25.269 --> 04:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
be standing on your front lawn however
 
04:08:27.429 --> 04:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
because you are within 100 feet of that
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
polling place
 
04:08:32.070 --> 04:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
you would be violating the law
 
04:08:33.429 --> 04:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
this would apply if you're driving in
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
your vehicle in a community that you are
 
04:08:37.269 --> 04:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
not familiar with but you happen to
 
04:08:40.070 --> 04:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
drive by a polling place unknowingly
 
04:08:42.790 --> 04:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
you would be violating the law
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
and i go back to that pickup truck
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
exception and well i do drive a pickup
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
truck so
 
04:08:48.790 --> 04:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
i would benefit from that but i don't
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%

and we hear a lot about intimidation of
 
04:09:02.550 --> 04:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
threatening someone is a crime and
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
against the law and it always will be

we
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
prior legislators were responsible
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
enough to make an enhanced penalty that
 
04:09:15.670 --> 04:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
if you threaten someone with a firearm
 
04:09:17.110 --> 04:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's actually an enhanced penalty and
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's a felony so whether you're at a
 
04:09:20.710 --> 04:09:20.720 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
04:15:59.910 --> 04:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
hb 1108 has become known in our
 
04:16:02.229 --> 04:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
committee as the purple paint bill
 
04:16:03.670 --> 04:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
it would give property owners
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
flexibility in how they post their
 
04:16:05.439 --> 04:16:07.349 align:start position:0%
flexibility in how they post their
property

04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
posting for those who don't know is a
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
process where you prohibit access or
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
limit access to certain activities on
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
your private land
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
current law makes very clear how
 
04:16:19.349 --> 04:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
property should be posted
 
04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
typically the owner must
 
04:16:23.830 --> 04:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
use very specific signs these signs cost
 
04:16:25.830 --> 04:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
money anywhere from a dollar to ten
 
04:16:27.510 --> 04:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
dollars per sign
 
04:16:30.870 --> 04:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
they must be placed within 100 yards of
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
each other
 
04:16:34.229 --> 04:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
and they must be kept in good order so
 
04:16:35.910 --> 04:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
this basically means the property owner
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
must walk their parcel
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh every year or so ensuring that it's
 
04:16:40.640 --> 04:16:41.830 align:start position:0%
uh every year or so ensuring that it's
posted

04:16:41.830 --> 04:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
posted
 
04:16:44.469 --> 04:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
to the letter of the law
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
for a very large parcel the cost of
 
04:16:47.670 --> 04:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
buying these signs and replacing these
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
signs can add up
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
our committee heard testimony that it is
 
04:16:53.910 --> 04:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
not easy to traverse your property line
 
04:16:57.110 --> 04:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
every year or two we learn that using
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
nails to post these signs can damage the
 
04:16:59.040 --> 04:17:00.229 align:start position:0%
nails to post these signs can damage the
tree

04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
tree
 
04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
and some elderly property owners are

to meet this law
 
04:17:09.990 --> 04:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
hb 1108 would give these property owners
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to mark their land with
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
purple blazes on trees
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
the method is used in 16 states and i
 
04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
have full confidence that new hampshire
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
residents can quickly figure out what a
 
04:17:24.389 --> 04:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
purple blaze means
 
04:17:25.830 --> 04:17:25.840 align:start position:0%

04:17:32.550 --> 04:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
of property rights which is something
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%

standards for boundary marking used by
 
04:18:30.950 --> 04:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
licensed surveyors in foresters
 
04:18:33.269 --> 04:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
that are more effective than those
 
04:18:35.110 --> 04:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
proposed in this bill
 
04:18:36.790 --> 04:18:36.800 align:start position:0%

04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
they said more people are hunting on
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
purple painted
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
property in maine than on any other
 
04:18:58.800 --> 04:19:02.309 align:start position:0%
property in maine than on any other
properties

04:19:02.309 --> 04:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:04.710 --> 04:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
they said it's very confusing
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
people don't understand it
 
04:19:06.800 --> 04:19:08.389 align:start position:0%
people don't understand it
and

04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
the main fishing game wish they could
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
get rid of the law
 
04:19:15.030 --> 04:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
lastly mr speaker
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
we also heard
 
04:19:20.309 --> 04:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire is unique
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
we have what is called
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
common land rule
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
in some states you don't go on people's
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
properties without getting permission
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is unique
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
we can go on anybody's property
 
04:19:39.030 --> 04:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
unless it's posted
 
04:19:40.469 --> 04:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
so up in the
 
04:19:42.710 --> 04:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
woods fields mountains you know we can
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
just walk out into them
 
04:19:46.630 --> 04:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
that is what you know is beautiful about
 
04:19:51.030 --> 04:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i've also heard
 
04:19:54.000 --> 04:19:54.950 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker i've also heard
that

04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
the national forest or the national
 
04:19:57.600 --> 04:19:59.189 align:start position:0%
the national forest or the national
parks

04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
parks
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
has some
 
04:20:05.110 --> 04:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
how confusing is that going to be
 
04:20:09.910 --> 04:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
and lastly well i said lastly once
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
before but i'll say it again lastly
 
04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
i understand that people can
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
and will
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
just drive down the road and spray paint
 
04:20:22.469 --> 04:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
a tree purple and then it becomes posted
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
at that point even if the landowner does
 
04:20:28.630 --> 04:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
not want it so i hope you will vote to
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.149 --> 04:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
report of any explaining to legislate on
 
04:20:40.630 --> 04:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
house bill 1108
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote members will be
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
in their seats
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative reid
 
04:20:57.030 --> 04:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:21:02.790 --> 04:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that the new
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution makes clear that
 
04:21:07.349 --> 04:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
property rights private property rights
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
are sacrosanct in our state
 
04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know that laws regulating the
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
exact way landowners must post their
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
land lest they be forced to allow anyone
 
04:21:18.309 --> 04:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
in the onto their private property
 
04:21:21.110 --> 04:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
restricts those property rights and if i
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
know that 1108 would not change any
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
trespass laws but merely give landowners
 
04:21:27.910 --> 04:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
the same choice they have in 26 other
 
04:21:30.790 --> 04:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
states with the use of paint which is
 
04:21:33.910 --> 04:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
more durable easier physically easier to
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
use and cheaper states like texas
 
04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
alabama florida
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
and finally i know that this is so
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
commonly used that major paint brands
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
like krylon and rust-oleum actually
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
create a no trespass purple color for
 
04:21:51.750 --> 04:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
this exact purpose then mr speaker would
 
04:22:01.349 --> 04:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:01.359 --> 04:22:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative burt
 
04:22:09.830 --> 04:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know the committee heard
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
testimony from the new hampshire fish
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
and game department that their peers in
 
04:22:21.750 --> 04:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
maine a state that allows purple paint
 
04:22:24.229 --> 04:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
post and say purple paint hosting is
 
04:22:26.229 --> 04:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
utterly chaos
 
04:22:29.189 --> 04:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
and often there are more people hunting
 
04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
on purple painted properties and the
 
04:22:33.910 --> 04:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
unposted properties
 
04:22:36.309 --> 04:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know the committee also
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
heard from the new hampshire division of
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
forest and lands that the current post
 
04:22:42.309 --> 04:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
and requirements which the landowner's
 
04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
name and contact information on the
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
signs is a good practice for a number of
 
04:22:50.790 --> 04:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
reasons i.e retrieving game animals
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
notifying landowners of
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
fire suppressor suppression activities
 
04:22:58.710 --> 04:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
and lastly mr speaker
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%

considered the same report the same with

the recommendation that the bill be

the minority of the committee having

considered the same and being unable to
 
04:33:21.189 --> 04:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
04:33:22.629 --> 04:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
04:33:24.629 --> 04:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
pass senator david muse from the
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%

04:33:41.510 --> 04:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's always interesting to see what
 
04:33:41.520 --> 04:33:42.551 align:start position:0%
it's always interesting to see what
happens

04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
happens
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
when a witch hunt meets moral integrity
 
04:33:47.910 --> 04:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately moral integrity doesn't
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
always win and neither does justice
 
04:33:53.910 --> 04:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
will it uphouse and goody cole are two
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
prime examples from our own new
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire history
 
04:33:59.670 --> 04:33:59.680 align:start position:0%

cole was the victim of an actual witch
hunt

04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
hunt
 
04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
she was convicted flogged and imprisoned
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
for witchcraft over 200 years ago
 
04:34:08.789 --> 04:34:08.799 align:start position:0%
uphouse was the victim of another kind
 
04:34:10.310 --> 04:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
of witch hunt
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the 1950s he was sentenced to a year
 
04:34:14.629 --> 04:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
in jail for refusing to turn over a list
 
04:34:16.230 --> 04:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
of guests and staff
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
of the world fellowship organization
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
to an overzealous new hampshire attorney
 
04:34:23.109 --> 04:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
general who wanted to comb through those
 
04:34:25.269 --> 04:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
lists looking for communists and
 
04:34:28.949 --> 04:34:28.959 align:start position:0%
connections to subversive organizations
 
04:34:31.269 --> 04:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
with the passage of time it has become
 
04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
increasingly apparent that a great
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
injustice was done to both
 
04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
hb 1127 is an opportunity for moral
 
04:34:42.551 --> 04:34:42.561 align:start position:0%
integrity to finally triumph
 
04:34:44.070 --> 04:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
it would not only set the record
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
straight for these two individuals
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
it would also set the record straight
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:55.269 --> 04:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this bill
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
always took the words of martin luther
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
king to heart
 
04:35:01.830 --> 04:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
the ark of the moral universe is long
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
but it bends towards justice
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
while we can't go back in time
 
04:35:10.390 --> 04:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
and erase injustice through this bill
 
04:35:12.390 --> 04:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
we would have the power both moral and
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
statutory to set the record straight
 
04:35:17.910 --> 04:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge our past mistakes and to
 
04:35:20.070 --> 04:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
carve out a place in our law that lets
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
future legislators set the record
 
04:35:24.390 --> 04:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
straight for others in similar
 
04:35:24.400 --> 04:35:26.949 align:start position:0%
straight for others in similar
circumstances

04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:35:28.551 --> 04:35:28.561 align:start position:0%
there are some who argue that this is a
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
privilege that is better conferred by
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
04:35:33.910 --> 04:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
but what we're talking about
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
in these cases aren't pardons for
 
04:35:39.510 --> 04:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
individuals who are still living
 
04:35:41.109 --> 04:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is a way for
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature to set the record
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
straight in those very rare instances
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
when a person who is no longer with us
 
04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
has suffered an incredible injustice at
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
the hands of the state
 
04:35:53.680 --> 04:35:54.551 align:start position:0%
the hands of the state
this

04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:35:55.990 --> 04:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
word for word
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
is ex
 
04:35:59.189 --> 04:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is word for word
 
04:36:01.830 --> 04:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
exactly the same bill as another bill
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
that we passed on consent in 2020 that
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
died in the other body because of covet
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote red to reverse the
 
04:36:14.070 --> 04:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation so another
 
04:36:17.670 --> 04:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
motion may be made thank
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%

04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:36:42.390 --> 04:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
did agree that there was good intent for
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
this bill and we agreed on the idea that
 
04:36:47.349 --> 04:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:36:50.150 --> 04:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
had for it but
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
during testimony and hearing we found
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
out that there are some technical
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
legalities that
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
the bill did not address properly and we
 
04:37:02.230 --> 04:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
need to address those properly for
 
04:37:02.240 --> 04:37:05.269 align:start position:0%
need to address those properly for
example

04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.070 --> 04:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
the goody was convicted by the
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
commonwealth of massachusetts
 
04:37:10.400 --> 04:37:11.349 align:start position:0%
commonwealth of massachusetts
well

04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
if i understand
 
04:37:15.910 --> 04:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
law the state of new hampshire
 
04:37:18.150 --> 04:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
cannot involve
 
04:37:18.160 --> 04:37:19.189 align:start position:0%
cannot involve
a

04:37:19.189 --> 04:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:37:21.910 --> 04:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
conviction of another state
 
04:37:21.920 --> 04:37:22.709 align:start position:0%
conviction of another state
so

04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
in this case
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
i would prefer that we
 
04:37:28.390 --> 04:37:28.400 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker if i know this bill
 
04:39:06.070 --> 04:39:06.080 align:start position:0%

personal interest for our
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
former democratic leader
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
and if i know this bill gives our state
 
04:39:13.109 --> 04:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
a tool
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%

and if i know that this bill

04:48:15.030 --> 04:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:48:16.470 --> 04:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
04:48:19.750 --> 04:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
hb 1178 is bad public policy that would
 
04:48:23.430 --> 04:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit state local and county police
 
04:48:25.350 --> 04:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
from enforcing and cooperating with the
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement of any u.s firearms law
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
federal regulation or presidential
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
executive order that we also don't have
 
04:48:34.550 --> 04:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
on the books here in new hampshire
 
04:48:36.788 --> 04:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
what often gets lost in this debate is
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
that there are relatively few federal
 
04:48:41.110 --> 04:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
gun laws on the books anyway
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
the ones that we do have on the books
 
04:48:44.628 --> 04:48:44.638 align:start position:0%
are similar to the laws that we have in
 
04:48:46.708 --> 04:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that make it illegal to
 
04:48:48.708 --> 04:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
straw purchase a firearm on behalf of
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
another person or to provide a gun to
 
04:48:54.390 --> 04:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
someone who is banned from having one
 
04:48:56.788 --> 04:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
the problem is that existing state and
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
federal laws alone have not been enough
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
to stop criminals specializing in
 
04:49:03.990 --> 04:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
trafficking guns across state lines to
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
other criminals and criminal gangs
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
that's where the recent efforts of the
 
04:49:11.110 --> 04:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
biden administration come in
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
in 2021 the president announced the
 
04:49:16.150 --> 04:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
formation of strike forces intended to
 
04:49:18.868 --> 04:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
sharply curtail significant firearms
 
04:49:21.190 --> 04:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking corridors that have diverted
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
guns to five major urban areas
 
04:49:26.470 --> 04:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
also announced were programs to work
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
with states to gather data on firearms
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
traffic trafficking for policy makers as
 
04:49:33.750 --> 04:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
well as rules that have yet to be
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
finalized to stop the proliferation of
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
ghost guns
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
ghost guns for those of you who may not
 
04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
be familiar with them are unmarked guns
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
without serial numbers that are sold as
 
04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
components in kit form
 
04:49:49.110 --> 04:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
these kits are easy to assemble often
 
04:49:52.390 --> 04:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
they come 80 percent pre-assembled and
 
04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
are currently exempt from background
 
04:49:54.480 --> 04:49:55.350 align:start position:0%
are currently exempt from background
checks

04:49:55.350 --> 04:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
checks
 
04:49:57.990 --> 04:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
making them hugely attractive to
 
04:49:58.000 --> 04:49:59.590 align:start position:0%
making them hugely attractive to
criminals

04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
criminals
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
while hb 1178 may have the stated
 
04:50:04.230 --> 04:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
purpose of protecting second amendment
 
04:50:04.240 --> 04:50:05.110 align:start position:0%
purpose of protecting second amendment
rights

04:50:05.110 --> 04:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:50:06.868 --> 04:50:06.878 align:start position:0%
what it would also do is undermine
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
cooperation between state and federal
 
04:50:12.310 --> 04:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in a very critical area
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
the result is easy to predict
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
more guns winding up in the hands of
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
more dangerous criminals
 
04:50:23.110 --> 04:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
hb 1178 is not about protecting gun
 
04:50:24.788 --> 04:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
rights our state and federal
 
04:50:27.030 --> 04:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
constitutions already do a pretty good
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
job of that
 
04:50:32.070 --> 04:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
what hb 1178 about is about is scoring
 
04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
political points by driving a divisive
 
04:50:36.628 --> 04:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary wedge between the state
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
and federal government when it comes to
 
04:50:40.868 --> 04:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
keeping guns out of the hands of
 
04:50:40.878 --> 04:50:42.230 align:start position:0%
keeping guns out of the hands of
criminals

04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
criminals
 
04:50:44.948 --> 04:50:44.958 align:start position:0%
it also has the very real potential of
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
greatly increasing the flow of illegal
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
firearms including ghost guns into and
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
out of our state
 
04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is hb 1178 does not make
 
04:50:58.470 --> 04:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire any safer for our
 
04:51:01.110 --> 04:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
residents our law enforcement personnel

please press the red button so another

04:51:14.310 --> 04:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
do you recognize his representative lynn
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
we are fortunate to live in a state that
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
strongly supports the right to keep and
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
bear arms
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately at the federal level under
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
the current administration that is not
 
04:51:34.150 --> 04:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
the case
 
04:51:36.948 --> 04:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
indeed based upon its actions to date
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
it seems clear that the present
 
04:51:40.628 --> 04:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
administration in washington
 
04:51:42.948 --> 04:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
regards the second amendment as a pesky
 
04:51:42.958 --> 04:51:44.150 align:start position:0%
regards the second amendment as a pesky
nuisance

04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
nuisance
 
04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
that it would repeal in a heartbeat if
 
04:51:48.390 --> 04:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
it had the power to do so
 
04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
but since it doesn't have that power
 
04:51:54.390 --> 04:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
it has set about a course of legislative
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
and regulatory proposals the aim of
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
which is to effectively emasculate the
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
second amendment through the strategy of
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
death by a thousand cuts
 
04:52:05.990 --> 04:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
hb seven eleven seventy eight is
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
designed to ensure
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire never becomes
 
04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
complicit in that strategy
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
the provisions of the bill are simple
 
04:52:15.670 --> 04:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
and straightforward
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill says that no
 
04:52:17.680 --> 04:52:18.948 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill says that no
personnel

04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
04:52:21.430 --> 04:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
or financial resources of this state or
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
its political subdivisions
 
04:52:26.070 --> 04:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
shall be used to enforce administer
 
04:52:28.390 --> 04:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
or cooperate with the federal government
 
04:52:30.868 --> 04:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
in the enforcement of any federal law
 
04:52:33.590 --> 04:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
regulation or executive order regarding
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
the regulation of firearms ammunition
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
firearms components etc
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
that is inconsistent with new hampshire
 
04:52:44.708 --> 04:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
law regarding the same subject matters
 
04:52:44.718 --> 04:52:45.830 align:start position:0%
law regarding the same subject matters
because

04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:52:47.670 --> 04:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
as in most states new hampshire law
 
04:52:49.510 --> 04:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement has a long history of
 
04:52:51.510 --> 04:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
cooperating with federal authorities in
 
04:52:54.550 --> 04:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
many areas of mutual interest
 
04:52:56.628 --> 04:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that the prohibitions in
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
section one
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
do not apply when federal authorities
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
are investigating someone as to whom
 
04:53:07.510 --> 04:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
there is reasonable suspicion to believe
 
04:53:09.510 --> 04:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
he or she he or she has committed a
 
04:53:13.030 --> 04:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
violation of state law or a violation of
 
04:53:16.708 --> 04:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
a federal law not covered by section one
 
04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
section two also allows state
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
authorities to provide their federal
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
counterparts with publicly available
 
04:53:26.230 --> 04:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
information criminal history information
 
04:53:28.390 --> 04:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
or information needed to fulfill new
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire's responsibilities under the
 
04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
national crime prevention and privacy
 
04:53:33.040 --> 04:53:34.628 align:start position:0%

from goffstown of the criminal justice
 
04:53:42.550 --> 04:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
committee that that committee worked
 
04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
very hard to achieve consensus on this
 
04:53:48.390 --> 04:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
legislation among various stakeholders
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
it includes provisions for example

thank you and mr speaker i would request
 
04:54:12.390 --> 04:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote on this
 
04:54:14.470 --> 04:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
a roll call a roll call has been
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%

04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i have a question for you
 
04:54:52.708 --> 04:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
have the rules of decorum in this body
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
changed it was my understanding that we
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
are never to assume motives of other
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
people and the previous speaker
 
04:55:04.788 --> 04:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
very definitely did
 
04:55:07.110 --> 04:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
ascribe to the president of the united
 
04:55:10.470 --> 04:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
states and many others motives that may
 
04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
or may not be accurate
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh you are correct representative and
 
04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was said before i got a
 
04:55:20.230 --> 04:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
chance to say anything because i didn't
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
know it was going to be said so
 
04:55:25.750 --> 04:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh the rest of his the rest of his
 
04:55:28.230 --> 04:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
testimony was
 
04:55:44.708 --> 04:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the ought to
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
pass with amendment motion on 1178
 
04:55:53.350 --> 04:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
04:55:54.868 --> 04:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:03.670 --> 04:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:56:05.670 --> 04:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
if i know that keeping firearms and
 
04:56:07.590 --> 04:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
other deadly materials out of the hands
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
of criminals and criminal gangs is one
 
04:56:10.628 --> 04:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
of the most
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
important duties of both our state and
 
04:56:14.788 --> 04:56:14.798 align:start position:0%
federal governments
 
04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the bill makes this
 
04:56:17.120 --> 04:56:18.788 align:start position:0%
and if i know that the bill makes this
tough

04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
tough
 
04:56:21.670 --> 04:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
on federal and state law enforcement
 
04:56:23.510 --> 04:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
and it makes it even tougher
 
04:56:25.270 --> 04:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
then would i press the red button so
 
04:56:30.390 --> 04:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:31.990 --> 04:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
chair recognized represented by
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:56:38.708 --> 04:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:56:40.150 --> 04:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:56:43.270 --> 04:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
if i know house bill 1178 would prohibit
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
the state from enforcing any federal
 
04:56:47.670 --> 04:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
statute regulations
 
04:56:50.150 --> 04:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
or presidential executive orders that
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
restrict or regulate the right of the
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
people to keep and bear arms
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know over the years
 
04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
on many topics both
 
04:57:04.150 --> 04:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
democrat and republican attorney
 
04:57:06.708 --> 04:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
generals have opined that new hampshire
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement should not
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
should not been forcing federal laws
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
and lastly mr speaker if i know this is
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
a simple concept state and local police
 
04:57:20.390 --> 04:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
are hired
 
04:57:23.110 --> 04:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
trained and compensated
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
with the state and local tax dollars
 
04:57:29.270 --> 04:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense to divert those scant
 
04:57:31.110 --> 04:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
resources to
 
04:57:35.190 --> 04:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
enforce federal laws that if they were
 
04:57:37.990 --> 04:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
they are to be enforced should properly
 
04:57:41.830 --> 04:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
be enforced by federal law enforcement
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
would i now press that very bright green
 
04:57:44.400 --> 04:57:45.430 align:start position:0%
would i now press that very bright green
button

04:57:45.430 --> 04:57:45.440 align:start position:0%

garth right to speak against the
 
05:03:14.628 --> 05:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:18.310 --> 05:03:18.320 align:start position:0%

the

05:03:19.030 --> 05:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:21.270 --> 05:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
amendment as well as the underlying bill
 
05:03:23.590 --> 05:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
is a far reach for an issue that's not
 
05:03:23.600 --> 05:03:24.788 align:start position:0%
is a far reach for an issue that's not
there

05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
at the moment the fair and impartial
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
police policy adopted by various
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
departments state that they will
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
cooperate with immigration and customs
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%

valid warrant
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
therefore the amendment creates another
 
05:03:42.390 --> 05:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
issue around valid warrants verse

requests
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is confusing vague and
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
oppressive to many
 
05:03:50.230 --> 05:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
this bill requires municipalities to
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
violate the 4th and 14th amendments
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
and will
 
05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
subject these entities to liability for
 
05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
those violations
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
remember that a person's presence in the
 
05:04:01.350 --> 05:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
united states in violation of
 
05:04:04.550 --> 05:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
immigration laws standing alone is not a
 
05:04:04.560 --> 05:04:05.670 align:start position:0%
immigration laws standing alone is not a
crime

05:04:05.670 --> 05:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
crime
 
05:04:08.550 --> 05:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
immigration violations are mostly civil
 
05:04:10.948 --> 05:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
not criminal in nature
 
05:04:13.910 --> 05:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
ice detainers are issued by ice agents
 
05:04:16.390 --> 05:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
themselves without any authorization or
 
05:04:18.390 --> 05:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
oversight by a judge
 
05:04:21.190 --> 05:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
or other neutral decision makers
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
ice detainers are not warrants but a
 
05:04:25.590 --> 05:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
mayor request
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
it is not a crime for an undocumented
 
05:04:30.708 --> 05:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
person to remain in the united states
 
05:04:33.270 --> 05:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
the bill contributes to the rise in hate
 
05:04:36.190 --> 05:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
and injustice perpetuated by national
 
05:04:36.200 --> 05:04:37.750 align:start position:0%

immigrant organizations
 
05:04:42.390 --> 05:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
this bill undermines community trust in
 
05:04:44.230 --> 05:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and will make new

05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
to report a crime or even testify as a
 
05:04:54.310 --> 05:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
witness to a crime
 
05:04:56.948 --> 05:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
even for domestic violence
 
05:04:59.430 --> 05:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
it may make the job of law
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement harder people afraid to talk
 
05:05:03.750 --> 05:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
and afraid of being deported after
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
assisting law enforcement
 
05:05:07.510 --> 05:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
this bill makes it illegal for a state
 
05:05:09.670 --> 05:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
or local agency to exercise its
 
05:05:09.680 --> 05:05:11.510 align:start position:0%
or local agency to exercise its
discretion

discretion
 
05:05:14.788 --> 05:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
threatening local control again the bill
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
expects cities and towns to expend
 
05:05:19.270 --> 05:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
resources to enforce federal immigration

federal government

the state
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
should not be about controlling the

decisions of cities or towns
 
05:05:32.470 --> 05:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
we love our motto live free or die and

05:06:18.550 --> 05:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
for some points of clarification
 
05:06:20.948 --> 05:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
h.b 1266 does not mandate that the
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
police or local law enforcement
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.910 --> 05:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
it also does not mandate or force or
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%

05:06:44.150 --> 05:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
it allows police to use their discretion

05:06:54.550 --> 05:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
it leaves the discretion to that law
 
05:06:56.550 --> 05:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency whether they wish to
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
cooperate with a detainer request

the amendment that was just adopted did
 
05:07:15.910 --> 05:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
exactly that it gave the law enforcement
 
05:07:19.030 --> 05:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
the discretion to make a sound decision
 
05:07:22.390 --> 05:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
on a case-by-case basis
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
some communities
 
05:07:25.510 --> 05:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire have adopted local
 
05:07:27.990 --> 05:07:28.000 align:start position:0%

05:07:34.230 --> 05:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
they the law enforcement body is not
 
05:07:37.030 --> 05:07:37.040 align:start position:0%

federal government
 
05:07:43.830 --> 05:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
and to put that in perspective think of
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
a hypothetical situation you can have a
 
05:07:46.000 --> 05:07:47.030 align:start position:0%

person

05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%

and upon an investigation while the
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
person's already in custody can be
 
05:07:56.000 --> 05:07:57.030 align:start position:0%

literally

05:07:57.030 --> 05:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
literally
 
05:07:58.470 --> 05:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
wanted by the federal government for
 
05:08:01.270 --> 05:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
acts of terrorism however because of the
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
policy adopted by some communities
 
05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
well that person would be released
 
05:08:06.310 --> 05:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
despite the
 
05:08:08.230 --> 05:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
threat to public safety they may
 
05:08:08.240 --> 05:08:09.830 align:start position:0%
threat to public safety they may
pose

05:22:30.390 --> 05:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker this bill would
 
05:22:31.830 --> 05:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
make it a felony as we just heard to
 
05:22:33.990 --> 05:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
transport drugs across state lines for
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of selling them
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
if you're thinking isn't this already a
 
05:22:39.430 --> 05:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
crime you'd be right it is already a
 
05:22:41.350 --> 05:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
class a felony in new hampshire
 
05:22:43.110 --> 05:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
does a felony to possess drugs with
 
05:22:45.430 --> 05:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
intent to sell in our state
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
regardless of how the drugs got here
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
and this bill would be very hard to
 
05:22:52.628 --> 05:22:52.638 align:start position:0%
enforce how do you prove that somebody
 
05:22:55.830 --> 05:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
brought the drugs over a state line
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would create a new mandatory
 
05:22:59.350 --> 05:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
minimum at a time when this house under
 
05:23:01.990 --> 05:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
democratic and republican majorities
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
have voted to eliminate mandatory
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
minimums in drug sentencing
 
05:23:08.390 --> 05:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
it would make the vehicle used for the
 
05:23:08.400 --> 05:23:10.230 align:start position:0%
it would make the vehicle used for the
crime

05:23:10.230 --> 05:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
crime
 
05:23:12.070 --> 05:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
stipulated in this bill subject to
 
05:23:12.080 --> 05:23:13.830 align:start position:0%
stipulated in this bill subject to
forfeiture

05:23:13.830 --> 05:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
yet hb 1296 which this house just passed
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
on a voice vote
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
exempted certain vehicles from
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
forfeiture so how these two bills get
 
05:23:23.750 --> 05:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
squared on this issue i really have no
 
05:23:23.760 --> 05:23:25.750 align:start position:0%
squared on this issue i really have no
idea

05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:23:28.948 --> 05:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
selling drugs is clearly an awful crime
 
05:23:30.788 --> 05:23:30.798 align:start position:0%
drug dealers can and should be punished
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
and they are under existing law
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstance this act
 
05:23:38.070 --> 05:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
can bring a mandatory life sentence
 
05:23:39.750 --> 05:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
as a society we've seen the negative
 
05:23:42.150 --> 05:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
effects associated with the war on drugs
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
we know that passing new laws with
 
05:23:46.390 --> 05:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
longer sentences does nothing to deter
 
05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
crime particularly drug crimes
 
05:23:51.670 --> 05:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
they have contributed to larger prison
 
05:23:53.830 --> 05:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
sentence prison populations in new
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and across the country and yet
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire the cost of
 
05:23:58.948 --> 05:23:58.958 align:start position:0%
incarcerating someone in state prison is
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
44 000 a year
 
05:24:05.110 --> 05:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
existing law gives prosecutors plenty
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
of flexibility to arrest prosecute and
 
05:24:09.270 --> 05:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
punish the bad guys
 
05:24:11.110 --> 05:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
we don't need any laws that duplicate
 
05:24:12.868 --> 05:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
what's already on the books
 
05:24:14.868 --> 05:24:14.878 align:start position:0%
i ask you defeat this motion by pressing
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
the red button so another could be made
 
05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:24.150 --> 05:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
a division vote has been requested
 
05:24:26.470 --> 05:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
we're down to the last speaker
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
so members take their seats
 
05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:37.270 --> 05:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:24:39.270 --> 05:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this bill is different than
 
05:24:41.430 --> 05:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
the law currently on the books first of
 
05:24:42.628 --> 05:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
all with regard to what the first
 
05:24:44.948 --> 05:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
speaker said regarding cannabis
 
05:24:46.708 --> 05:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
it was absolutely incorrect this law
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
exempts cannabis from being one of the
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
laws that could trigger this
 
05:24:53.830 --> 05:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
second of all i am in agreement with the
 
05:24:56.070 --> 05:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
second speaker that we are trying to
 
05:24:58.788 --> 05:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
roll back the sentences and the rule on
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
drugs as it applies to individual users
 
05:25:04.548 --> 05:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
who are victims who are addicts who need
 
05:25:04.558 --> 05:25:05.510 align:start position:0%
who are victims who are addicts who need
help

05:25:05.510 --> 05:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
help
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
but at the same time as we roll back
 
05:25:07.440 --> 05:25:08.470 align:start position:0%
but at the same time as we roll back
those

05:25:08.470 --> 05:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
we have to address the the problem of
 
05:25:14.150 --> 05:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
these drugs coming into our state we
 
05:25:15.670 --> 05:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have as many addicts if we
 
05:25:18.150 --> 05:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have as much drugs so the drugs
 
05:25:19.350 --> 05:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
aren't being made in new hampshire
 
05:25:21.510 --> 05:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
they're being brought into new hampshire
 
05:25:23.270 --> 05:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
now the previous speaker asked how would
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
we know where they came from well it's
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
not difficult when a vehicle gets pulled
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
over crossing the state line and there's
 
05:25:31.670 --> 05:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
drugs worthy inside of the level of
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
distribution to know where it came from
 
05:25:35.590 --> 05:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
it came across the state line
 
05:25:37.830 --> 05:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
so at the same time as we address the
 
05:25:39.670 --> 05:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
scourge of addiction
 
05:25:41.750 --> 05:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we have to do something to stop the
 
05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
drugs coming in and this is a very very
 
05:25:47.190 --> 05:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
strong deterrent if you know that
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
there's a chance that you're going to
 
05:25:49.830 --> 05:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
get pulled over coming to the state of
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to distribute your poison
 
05:25:54.070 --> 05:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
to our children that you would do five
 
05:25:56.310 --> 05:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
years mandatory in jail you're going to
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
think twice about it and you're going to
 
05:26:00.470 --> 05:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
think twice about risking your property
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
and your freedom
 
05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
i think that's a small price to pay in
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
exchange for the lives of our children
 
05:26:08.310 --> 05:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
that we are losing every day
 
05:26:10.470 --> 05:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
the war on drugs itself
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
is is the way it's going it's losing
 
05:26:15.190 --> 05:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
so let's look at it differently let's
 
05:26:17.510 --> 05:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
treat the people who are using the drugs
 
05:26:19.350 --> 05:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
give them the treatment they need and
 
05:26:21.510 --> 05:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately punish the people who are
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
bringing the poison across the borders
 
05:26:25.830 --> 05:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
to this state they are not originating
 
05:26:27.910 --> 05:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i would ask you to
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
support the committee's decision and
 
05:26:32.070 --> 05:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass as amended on this
 
05:26:36.070 --> 05:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:38.230 --> 05:26:38.240 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote
 
05:26:40.470 --> 05:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
pis have been waived off so we're going
 
05:27:31.510 --> 05:27:31.520 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker if i know that
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
judges in our state have already ruled
 
05:34:00.470 --> 05:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
that the scent of cannabis alone
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
does not give probable cause for a
 
05:34:02.558 --> 05:34:03.910 align:start position:0%
does not give probable cause for a
search

05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
search
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this very simple bill
 
05:34:09.670 --> 05:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
puts that standard into law
 
05:34:11.590 --> 05:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know it is the job of
 
05:34:15.510 --> 05:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature not judges to make laws
 
05:34:17.350 --> 05:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
would i press the red button to defeat
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
tabling so we can debate this bill and

case to actually give the holding
 
05:34:39.830 --> 05:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
context in the law
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know that this could
 
05:34:44.310 --> 05:34:44.320 align:start position:0%

nearly eliminates bail reform
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
and is strongly opposed by people across
 
05:40:08.708 --> 05:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
the political spectrum
 
05:40:10.548 --> 05:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
and if i know that there's a bill coming
 
05:40:11.990 --> 05:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
over from the other body which is
 
05:40:14.390 --> 05:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
preferable to this bill and if i know
 
05:40:15.628 --> 05:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
that we have another

thank you mr speaker
 
05:43:14.830 --> 05:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
mr speaker house bill
 
05:43:18.150 --> 05:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
1476 says that any person who's out on
 
05:43:20.868 --> 05:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
bail and arrested for the third time
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
for a class b misdemeanor
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
shall be held in jail for no more than
 
05:43:29.590 --> 05:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
36 hours pending a hearing for a judge
 
05:43:29.600 --> 05:43:30.708 align:start position:0%
36 hours pending a hearing for a judge
well

05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:43:33.270 --> 05:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
let's say held no more than three or
 
05:43:36.470 --> 05:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
four days because no more than 36 hours
 
05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
not including any holidays
 
05:43:41.110 --> 05:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
or weekends
 
05:43:43.430 --> 05:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
i ask you mr speaker
 
05:43:45.190 --> 05:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
what type of person do you think would
 
05:43:47.430 --> 05:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
be possibly be charged with a class b
 
05:43:47.440 --> 05:43:48.548 align:start position:0%
be possibly be charged with a class b
demeanor

05:43:48.548 --> 05:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
demeanor
 
05:43:51.590 --> 05:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
three or four times in a row before
 
05:43:53.190 --> 05:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
they're even getting
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
been taken before a judge
 
05:43:57.830 --> 05:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
i suggest that they could possibly be a
 
05:44:00.788 --> 05:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
person with drug problems
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
or they could be a homeless person
 
05:44:05.110 --> 05:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
or they could be a person with serious
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
mental health issues
 
05:44:09.270 --> 05:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
i suggest that these people
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
this bill will affect
 
05:44:12.390 --> 05:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
those among us
 
05:44:14.788 --> 05:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
who have the very least
 
05:44:16.788 --> 05:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
please note that anyone found guilty of
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
a class b misdemeanor will only be
 
05:44:22.230 --> 05:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
subject to a mis for fine
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
no jail time is associated at all with a
 
05:44:27.830 --> 05:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
class b misdemeanor
 
05:44:29.350 --> 05:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
where is the justice
 
05:44:33.990 --> 05:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
in throwing a person in jail for two or
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
three or four days
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
when if they were eventually found
 
05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
guilty the judge simply says
 
05:44:43.190 --> 05:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
guilty with a hundred dollar fine
 
05:44:45.190 --> 05:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
no jail time
 
05:44:47.830 --> 05:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
does that make any sense to you
 
05:44:49.750 --> 05:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
throwing a person with mental health or
 
05:44:52.150 --> 05:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
addiction issues in jail
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
is not therapy
 
05:44:57.430 --> 05:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 1476 creates an unfunded
 
05:44:57.440 --> 05:44:59.190 align:start position:0%
house bill 1476 creates an unfunded
mandate

05:44:59.190 --> 05:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
05:45:02.948 --> 05:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
by adding approximately 110 to 130 a day
 
05:45:05.350 --> 05:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
for incarceration costs
 
05:45:06.470 --> 05:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
per day
 
05:45:09.190 --> 05:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
per person and that cost is forced on
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
the cities and counties as an unfunded
 
05:45:12.000 --> 05:45:14.070 align:start position:0%
the cities and counties as an unfunded
mandate

05:45:14.070 --> 05:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
05:45:17.030 --> 05:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1476 violates the due process
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%

05:45:51.030 --> 05:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
05:45:52.150 --> 05:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
the member from manchester
 
05:45:53.750 --> 05:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative bolden is recognized to
 
05:46:00.390 --> 05:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:02.948 --> 05:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
i've been quiet on this bill up until
 
05:46:06.788 --> 05:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
now and that's because i'm in an awkward
 
05:46:08.788 --> 05:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
position as chairman of the manchester
 
05:46:11.110 --> 05:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
delegation and the city of manchester
 
05:46:12.948 --> 05:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
supports this bill
 
05:46:15.270 --> 05:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
however when i put on this name tag and
 
05:46:17.270 --> 05:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
enter this chamber i don't represent the
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
city or its departments i represent the
 
05:46:21.750 --> 05:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
residents of my district
 
05:46:23.670 --> 05:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
and that and for that reason i rise to
 
05:46:25.868 --> 05:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
speak against the committee report on hb
 
05:46:25.878 --> 05:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
speak against the committee report on hb
1476

05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
1476
 
05:46:29.350 --> 05:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
because i know the people of manchester
 
05:46:31.590 --> 05:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
support bail reform
 
05:46:33.270 --> 05:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
this bill purports to fix what is
 
05:46:35.430 --> 05:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
characterized as a catch and release
 
05:46:35.440 --> 05:46:36.708 align:start position:0%
characterized as a catch and release
system

05:46:36.708 --> 05:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:46:38.470 --> 05:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
supporters of this legislation claim
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
that dangerous individuals are being
 
05:46:42.150 --> 05:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
released on bail where they then
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
continue to victimize people
 
05:46:46.390 --> 05:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
if that were true how is it that crime
 
05:46:48.310 --> 05:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
rates in nearly every category have
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
decreased since bail reform was passed
 
05:46:51.990 --> 05:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
05:46:53.830 --> 05:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
in fact the overall crime rate is down
 
05:46:56.070 --> 05:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
14 percent
 
05:46:57.990 --> 05:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
the reality is that under bail reform
 
05:47:00.470 --> 05:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
offenders who are dangerous are already
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
held in jail without bail
 
05:47:04.548 --> 05:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
regardless of the crime they've
 
05:47:06.390 --> 05:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
committed it's called preventive
 
05:47:08.470 --> 05:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
detention it exists under current law
 
05:47:11.430 --> 05:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
and it is implemented on a regular basis
 
05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
in spite of the overall success that
 
05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
bail reform has delivered this
 
05:47:17.830 --> 05:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
legislation would have us move backward
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
to an era of higher crime and mass
 
05:47:20.400 --> 05:47:22.470 align:start position:0%
to an era of higher crime and mass
incarceration

05:47:22.470 --> 05:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
05:47:24.390 --> 05:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
it brings back income-based
 
05:47:24.400 --> 05:47:25.750 align:start position:0%
it brings back income-based
discrimination

05:47:25.750 --> 05:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
05:47:27.670 --> 05:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
it brings back
 
05:47:30.150 --> 05:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
holding individuals in a jail cell
 
05:47:32.708 --> 05:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
merely because they can't afford to buy
 
05:47:34.628 --> 05:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
their freedom
 
05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
it brings back a system where a wealthy
 
05:47:40.230 --> 05:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
criminal goes home and a poor man stays
 
05:47:43.350 --> 05:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
in jail that's not justice that's an
 
05:47:43.360 --> 05:47:45.350 align:start position:0%
in jail that's not justice that's an
injustice

05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
injustice
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
if this bill becomes law individuals who
 
05:47:49.990 --> 05:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
are arrested while out on bail even for
 
05:47:52.868 --> 05:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
a simple misdemeanor such as trespassing
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
must be held in jail for up to 36 hours
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
not including weekends or holidays until
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
they can see a judge
 
05:48:02.470 --> 05:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
so if they're arrested on a friday
 
05:48:04.150 --> 05:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
evening they could sit in jail until
 
05:48:04.160 --> 05:48:05.350 align:start position:0%
evening they could sit in jail until
wednesday

05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
05:48:07.990 --> 05:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
this bill also binds the hands of the
 
05:48:10.948 --> 05:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
judge by removing personal recognizance
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
as a bail option
 
05:48:15.910 --> 05:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
this means the judge must order cash
 
05:48:15.920 --> 05:48:17.270 align:start position:0%
this means the judge must order cash
bail

05:48:17.270 --> 05:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
bail
 
05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
and what if the defendant can't afford

disproportionately

disproportionately

data from the fbi shows that black

three and a quarter times more likely to

reckoning around systemic racism it is
 
05:49:12.310 --> 05:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
unconscionable that legislators would

oppose hb 1476.

supporters of this legislation also

substance misuse disorder can get
 
05:49:32.788 --> 05:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
treatment in jail while they wait for
 
05:49:35.830 --> 05:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
their trial while that just isn't true
 
05:49:38.390 --> 05:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
individuals held pre-trial are not

the list of organizations that are

these organizations certainly don't
 
05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
agree very often but they all agree that
 
05:50:26.390 --> 05:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
we need to kill this bill
 
05:50:28.708 --> 05:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
why does this bill draw the ire of such
 
05:50:31.110 --> 05:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan and diverse coalition of

it's because they all see it for what it
is

05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:50:38.470 --> 05:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
a return to the barbaric practice
 
05:50:40.390 --> 05:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
of the cash bail system
 
05:50:42.390 --> 05:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
a return to a system that addresses

mental illness homelessness and poverty
 
05:50:48.230 --> 05:50:48.240 align:start position:0%

i urge all my colleagues to vote red and
 
05:50:52.548 --> 05:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because it will have
 
05:50:55.670 --> 05:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
very real and very dire consequences for
 
05:50:58.230 --> 05:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
minorities homeless individuals and
 
05:50:59.750 --> 05:50:59.760 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker i rise in support
 
05:51:17.110 --> 05:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
of the other passes amended question i
 
05:51:19.270 --> 05:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
agree people should not be detained in
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
jail simply because they can't afford to
 
05:51:24.070 --> 05:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
pay the bail amount in 2018 i supported
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
the current statute however i've learned
 
05:51:28.390 --> 05:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
and experienced in manchester the
 
05:51:30.788 --> 05:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of multiple
 
05:51:33.430 --> 05:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
arrests of the same people on bail
 
05:51:35.830 --> 05:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
as an alderman in manchester i've
 
05:51:38.868 --> 05:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
i receive arrest statements frequently
 
05:51:41.190 --> 05:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
and notice early on that the same people
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
were being arrested again for the same
 
05:51:45.270 --> 05:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
crime i needed to explain to my
 
05:51:47.350 --> 05:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
constituents why the same person for
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
example that damaged your car last week
 
05:51:51.510 --> 05:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
trying to take things out of it was
 
05:51:53.190 --> 05:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
arrested again for damaging your
 
05:51:54.868 --> 05:51:54.878 align:start position:0%
neighbor's vehicle the next the
 
05:51:57.030 --> 05:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
following week
 
05:51:59.030 --> 05:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
i too represent
 
05:52:01.270 --> 05:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
my constituents which are both
 
05:52:04.310 --> 05:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
my state rep had in my automatic hat
 
05:52:06.230 --> 05:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
i've also witnessed discussion within
 
05:52:08.868 --> 05:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
specific groups that were mentioned by
 
05:52:11.750 --> 05:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
the prior speaker that
 
05:52:14.150 --> 05:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
that have made their colleagues they've
 
05:52:15.750 --> 05:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
made their colleagues aware of the
 
05:52:17.670 --> 05:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
criminal activity
 
05:52:19.430 --> 05:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
not to be concerned about going around
 
05:52:21.510 --> 05:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
breaking into cars
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to get arrested and i'm
 
05:52:24.628 --> 05:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing you within two to three
 
05:52:26.548 --> 05:52:26.558 align:start position:0%
hours we're going to get released that's
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
the conversation they're having this is
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
the this is what we've been hearing in
 
05:52:32.948 --> 05:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
the city of manchester
 
05:52:35.590 --> 05:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
not let alone the the
 
05:52:37.590 --> 05:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
let alone the uh
 
05:52:39.670 --> 05:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
the extra work extra
 
05:52:42.310 --> 05:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
resources spent on our police force
 
05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
repeatedly picking up these people
 
05:52:46.708 --> 05:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
repeatedly week week after week after
 
05:52:46.718 --> 05:52:47.910 align:start position:0%

week
 
05:52:49.670 --> 05:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
this has no benefit to the person
 
05:52:51.910 --> 05:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
arrested or to the neighborhoods
 
05:52:51.920 --> 05:52:53.190 align:start position:0%

involved
 
05:52:55.750 --> 05:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
let alone the resources spent
 
05:52:58.470 --> 05:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
hospital 1476 is a start in addressing
 
05:53:00.548 --> 05:53:00.558 align:start position:0%

one-size-fits-all legislation will
 
05:53:59.510 --> 05:53:59.520 align:start position:0%

limited anecdotal stories from our law

enforcement leaders proponents of this
 
05:54:20.070 --> 05:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
legislation has proved
 
05:54:22.628 --> 05:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
no data to support their claims that the
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
current bail system makes new hampshire
 
05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
less safe
 
05:54:30.390 --> 05:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation will disproportionately

harm black people
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's criminal laws are
 
05:54:37.990 --> 05:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
enforced with a staggering racial bias
 
05:54:40.150 --> 05:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
for example in 2020
 
05:54:43.430 --> 05:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
black people were 3.29 times more likely
 
05:54:45.510 --> 05:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
to be arrested compared with white
 
05:54:45.520 --> 05:54:46.708 align:start position:0%
to be arrested compared with white
people

05:54:46.708 --> 05:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:54:49.030 --> 05:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
for many low-level discretionary
 
05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
offenses this disparity
 
05:54:54.948 --> 05:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
were even more troubling including 4.8
 
05:54:57.990 --> 05:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
times for marijuana possession despite
 
05:55:00.868 --> 05:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
both groups using marijuana at roughly
 
05:55:02.708 --> 05:55:02.718 align:start position:0%
the same rate
 
05:55:06.670 --> 05:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
5.9 times for disorderly conduct
 
05:55:10.470 --> 05:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
6.52 times for vagrancy
 
05:55:11.990 --> 05:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
because black people are
 
05:55:14.230 --> 05:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
disproportionately arrested they will
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
also be disproportionately incarcerated
 
05:55:19.270 --> 05:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
under this legislation's mandatory
 
05:55:21.670 --> 05:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
incarceration regime
 
05:55:23.430 --> 05:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
in the midst of a national reckoning
 
05:55:26.548 --> 05:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
around system racism and police violence
 
05:55:29.350 --> 05:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
it is unconscionable that legislators
 
05:55:31.110 --> 05:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
would expand the already
 
05:55:33.510 --> 05:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
disproportionate incarceration of black
 
05:55:35.750 --> 05:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire
 
05:55:38.070 --> 05:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation will expand the
 
05:55:40.230 --> 05:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
criminalization of poverty in new
 
05:55:40.240 --> 05:55:41.270 align:start position:0%
criminalization of poverty in new
hampshire

05:55:41.270 --> 05:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:55:43.110 --> 05:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
personal reconnaissance bills was
 
05:55:45.430 --> 05:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
implemented to ensure that people could
 
05:55:47.670 --> 05:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
not afford bail could be released
 
05:55:49.590 --> 05:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
assuming the court did not find them to
 
05:55:52.628 --> 05:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
be a danger or flight risk
 
05:55:54.788 --> 05:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
under this proposed legislation people
 
05:55:56.868 --> 05:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
who are arrested while on pre-trial
 
05:55:59.190 --> 05:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
release will be denied personal
 
05:56:01.830 --> 05:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
reconnaissance bail thus setting up a
 
05:56:05.110 --> 05:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
new wealth-based incarceration system
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
where those with wealth can purchase
 
05:56:09.190 --> 05:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
their freedom
 
05:56:11.750 --> 05:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
so i appoint you my colleagues that you
 
05:56:15.510 --> 05:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
vote against the ought to pass for hp
 
05:56:19.990 --> 05:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
1476. thank you mr speaker
 
05:56:22.230 --> 05:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
we're down to the final speaker and this
 
05:56:24.548 --> 05:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be a voice vote so maybe
 
05:56:26.230 --> 05:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
find our seats the member from
 
05:56:27.990 --> 05:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
manchester representative barry is
 
05:56:29.670 --> 05:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak in support of the
 
05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
05:56:33.430 --> 05:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and thank you to
 
05:56:35.190 --> 05:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
the body for allowing this debate to
 
05:56:37.350 --> 05:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
take place i know it's been a long day
 
05:56:40.230 --> 05:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
and we've got more to go
 
05:56:42.708 --> 05:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
i represent the south side of manchester
 
05:56:44.788 --> 05:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
wards six and eight
 
05:56:47.350 --> 05:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
when i door knocked and campaigned
 
05:56:49.990 --> 05:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
i knocked on over 4 500 doors and when
 
05:56:51.430 --> 05:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
you do that you would expect when you
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
meet a lot of voters and you would
 
05:56:54.548 --> 05:56:54.558 align:start position:0%
expect to hear the traditional issues
 
05:56:57.670 --> 05:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
guns abortion education
 
05:57:00.150 --> 05:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
an overwhelming vast majority of my
 
05:57:03.510 --> 05:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
constituents cited bail reform
 
05:57:06.628 --> 05:57:06.638 align:start position:0%
because it is a manchester problem
 
05:57:08.070 --> 05:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
for those of you who pay attention to
 
05:57:09.910 --> 05:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
politics you know that me and my mayor
 
05:57:12.150 --> 05:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
don't always get along
 
05:57:15.430 --> 05:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
the very first thing i did upon winning
 
05:57:19.350 --> 05:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
my election before we were even sworn in
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
was meet with our police department to
 
05:57:23.990 --> 05:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
try to look at ways to fix
 
05:57:27.430 --> 05:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
pr bail or bail reform in general and
 
05:57:29.350 --> 05:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
everyone was pointing fingers because
 
05:57:31.350 --> 05:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
the reform that this body had just
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
passed was still taking effect
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
and we and i was told to wait
 
05:57:38.788 --> 05:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
so we waited
 
05:57:41.510 --> 05:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
mr speaker manchester is done waiting
 
05:57:43.350 --> 05:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
the other communities that are affected
 
05:57:46.548 --> 05:57:46.558 align:start position:0%
by this are done waiting
 
05:57:48.470 --> 05:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
last year we just had our crime report
 
05:57:50.230 --> 05:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
out and my one of the other members from
 
05:57:52.150 --> 05:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
manchester referenced that report
 
05:57:54.548 --> 05:57:54.558 align:start position:0%
property crime in manchester is up 10
 
05:57:54.558 --> 05:57:55.830 align:start position:0%
property crime in manchester is up 10
percent

05:57:55.830 --> 05:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:57:57.590 --> 05:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's up 10 percent in manchester in one
 
05:57:57.600 --> 05:57:58.708 align:start position:0%
it's up 10 percent in manchester in one
year

05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:58:00.230 --> 05:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
and i want to talk about the specifics
 
05:58:01.750 --> 05:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill because they often get
 
05:58:01.760 --> 05:58:03.430 align:start position:0%
of this bill because they often get
overlooked

05:58:03.430 --> 05:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
overlooked
 
05:58:04.948 --> 05:58:04.958 align:start position:0%
does anybody guess what the current
 
05:58:07.030 --> 05:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
standard is for being held
 
05:58:09.350 --> 05:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's 72 hours
 
05:58:12.470 --> 05:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
so what did we do to try to bring in as
 
05:58:14.470 --> 05:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
many people as possible on this we
 
05:58:17.270 --> 05:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
compromised and we shortened it to 36
 
05:58:20.230 --> 05:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
hours you heard that correct if you vote
 
05:58:22.628 --> 05:58:22.638 align:start position:0%
for this bill you are shortening the
 
05:58:24.708 --> 05:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
amount of time that someone can legally
 
05:58:29.990 --> 05:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:31.750 --> 05:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
05:58:34.230 --> 05:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
we are not trying to overturn the bail
 
05:58:37.430 --> 05:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
reform that this body passed we are
 
05:58:40.310 --> 05:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
talking about people who are already out
 
05:58:41.750 --> 05:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
on bail
 
05:58:43.350 --> 05:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
they are already out on bail and they
 
05:58:45.670 --> 05:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
have been arrested again but again the
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
other side came to us and said can you
 
05:58:50.230 --> 05:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
compromise and we said yes we will
 
05:58:52.070 --> 05:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
because we want you on board so we
 
05:58:54.708 --> 05:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
reduced the we reduced it for three
 
05:58:57.110 --> 05:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
times for class b misdemeanors you have
 
05:58:59.910 --> 05:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
to be arrested three times for a class b
 
05:59:02.628 --> 05:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor before this kicks in
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
dwi is a class b misdemeanor
 
05:59:10.708 --> 05:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
mr speaker manchester is done waiting

our communities are done waiting and i
 
05:59:14.548 --> 05:59:14.558 align:start position:0%

the house will come to order
 
06:00:49.270 --> 06:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
the question before the house is the
 
06:00:51.670 --> 06:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
majority committee report of acha pass
 
06:00:54.070 --> 06:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
with amendment
 
06:00:55.670 --> 06:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative newman is recognized for
 
06:01:05.590 --> 06:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:13.510 --> 06:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
if i know that this bill changes the
 
06:01:17.750 --> 06:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
permissive roared may
 
06:01:20.548 --> 06:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
to the mandatory word shall
 
06:01:22.628 --> 06:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
mandating that decisions on bail and
 
06:01:25.590 --> 06:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
release must be made by judges
 
06:01:27.510 --> 06:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
who are only available during business
 
06:01:30.390 --> 06:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
hours monday through friday
 
06:01:32.470 --> 06:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this change
 
06:01:35.830 --> 06:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
eliminates access to bail commissioners
 
06:01:39.990 --> 06:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
for people who are affected by this bill
 
06:01:43.110 --> 06:01:43.120 align:start position:0%
and prevents their access to due process
 
06:01:46.150 --> 06:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
when judges are not available
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
even though they have only been charged
 
06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
in our innocent until proven guilty
 
06:01:53.670 --> 06:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
and when i asked one of the police
 
06:01:55.990 --> 06:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
chiefs that testified
 
06:01:58.708 --> 06:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
if this would be a better bill
 
06:01:58.718 --> 06:01:59.590 align:start position:0%
if this would be a better bill
if

06:01:59.590 --> 06:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
judges were available
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
to make the judgments during
 
06:02:05.830 --> 06:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
non-business hours at night and on
 
06:02:05.840 --> 06:02:08.548 align:start position:0%
non-business hours at night and on
weekends

06:02:08.548 --> 06:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:12.788 --> 06:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
he said that it certainly would
 
06:02:14.948 --> 06:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
so would i now press the red button to
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
and continue to provide the same due
 
06:02:21.110 --> 06:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
process to all people
 
06:02:23.910 --> 06:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of when they are charged and
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:30.628 --> 06:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative conley is recognized for
 
06:02:33.990 --> 06:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:35.990 --> 06:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker if i know that this
 
06:02:37.750 --> 06:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill retains the core tenants of new
 
06:02:40.708 --> 06:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire's 2018 bail reform bill while
 
06:02:43.190 --> 06:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
addressing cases when the same person is
 
06:02:45.350 --> 06:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
arrested multiple times while already

06:09:29.910 --> 06:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
and how difficult it is to prove that
 
06:09:31.750 --> 06:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
you didn't do it if you say you didn't
 
06:09:32.868 --> 06:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
do it
 
06:09:34.390 --> 06:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
let's talk for a second about something
 
06:09:36.788 --> 06:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
else let's talk about victims
 
06:09:38.548 --> 06:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
if you're sentenced to life in prison
 
06:09:40.868 --> 06:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
without the possibility of parole it's
 
06:09:42.788 --> 06:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
generally going to be for a heinous
 
06:09:46.390 --> 06:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
murder or a horrible sexual offense
 
06:09:48.150 --> 06:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
what this bill is going to do is it's
 
06:09:49.510 --> 06:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to make people who thought that
 
06:09:51.270 --> 06:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
they had put this behind them and moved
 
06:09:54.070 --> 06:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
on with their lives have to relive
 
06:09:56.788 --> 06:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
the horror that they went through to put
 
06:09:59.030 --> 06:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
this person in jail in the first place
 
06:10:01.110 --> 06:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
someone murders your child and they get
 
06:10:03.590 --> 06:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
sentenced to life without parole
 
06:10:05.430 --> 06:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
you start to be able to heal and move on
 
06:10:07.590 --> 06:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
with your life but because for whatever
 
06:10:08.868 --> 06:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
reason we decided now we're going to
 
06:10:10.788 --> 06:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
give them parole hearings
 
06:10:13.110 --> 06:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
every single victim of those people
 
06:10:15.350 --> 06:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
those 186 people that are currently
 
06:10:17.590 --> 06:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
serving life without parole are going to
 
06:10:19.910 --> 06:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
have to relive the trauma of what was
 
06:10:21.750 --> 06:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
done to them
 
06:10:23.910 --> 06:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
just for this we heard testimony from
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
the parole board that they they would be
 
06:10:27.670 --> 06:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed by this number of people
 
06:10:29.030 --> 06:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be it would back up the
 
06:10:31.270 --> 06:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
people that deserve parole and delay
 
06:10:34.230 --> 06:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
their hearings so for a second let's all
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
just pause
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
and think about victims
 
06:10:40.070 --> 06:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
this is just i can't think of anything
 
06:10:42.788 --> 06:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
more horrific to do to someone who's had
 
06:10:44.628 --> 06:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
moved on with their lives
 
06:10:46.470 --> 06:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
suffered trauma like this to be get a
 
06:10:47.910 --> 06:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
letter in the mail and say oh you're
 
06:10:49.910 --> 06:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
invited to a parole hearing for the
 
06:10:51.830 --> 06:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
person that raped or murdered or did
 
06:10:54.628 --> 06:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
whatever to your loved one now come and
 
06:10:56.708 --> 06:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
testify again so that they can stay in
 
06:10:59.270 --> 06:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
jail so mr speaker i would ask everyone
 
06:11:01.910 --> 06:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
to to really think about their permanent
 
06:11:03.430 --> 06:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:11:05.590 --> 06:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
support the inexpedient to legislate on
 
06:11:08.868 --> 06:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:10.548 --> 06:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
representative abramson requests a roll
 
06:11:13.670 --> 06:11:13.680 align:start position:0%

06:11:16.230 --> 06:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
it is not sufficiently seconded this
 
06:11:17.750 --> 06:11:17.760 align:start position:0%

06:11:17.760 --> 06:12:02.708 align:start position:0%

cases
 
06:13:27.190 --> 06:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that eight members of the
 
06:13:29.350 --> 06:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee agreed not
 
06:13:31.190 --> 06:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
just this this year but also the last
 
06:13:34.150 --> 06:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
time that the same bill was introduced
 
06:13:35.430 --> 06:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
06:13:38.470 --> 06:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
that far far worse than the traumatic
 
06:13:40.310 --> 06:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
experience of having to go through the
 
06:13:42.470 --> 06:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
trial the first time is discovering that
 
06:13:44.948 --> 06:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
someone else has admitted
 
06:13:46.788 --> 06:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
to the murder of a family member of
 
06:13:49.750 --> 06:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
yours but if i also know that even in
 
06:13:51.910 --> 06:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
instances where other people have
 
06:13:54.708 --> 06:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
admitted that the person in prison is is
 
06:13:56.310 --> 06:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
either not guilty or was not there or
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
was only an accomplice
 
06:14:00.150 --> 06:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
that those people do not get a new trial
 
06:14:02.948 --> 06:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
in most cases would i now press the red
 
06:14:04.708 --> 06:14:04.718 align:start position:0%

06:18:16.390 --> 06:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say aye all those
 
06:18:21.510 --> 06:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:33.110 --> 06:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:34.310 --> 06:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee on
 
06:18:35.830 --> 06:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and public safety to
 
06:18:38.310 --> 06:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
which was referred house bill 1668 an
 
06:18:40.150 --> 06:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
act requiring a background check prior
 
06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
to any commercial firearm sale having
 
06:18:44.150 --> 06:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
06:18:46.150 --> 06:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
the following resolution resolved that
 
06:18:47.750 --> 06:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
it is inexpedient to legislate
 
06:18:49.110 --> 06:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
representative john burke for the
 
06:18:50.868 --> 06:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee
 
06:18:52.310 --> 06:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee having
 
06:18:54.230 --> 06:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
considered the same and being unable to
 
06:18:56.150 --> 06:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority report with the
 
06:18:57.590 --> 06:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
06:18:59.750 --> 06:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
pass representative casey conley for the
 
06:19:01.990 --> 06:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee
 
06:19:03.750 --> 06:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
the member from manchester
 
06:19:05.350 --> 06:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
representative bradley is recognized to
 
06:19:12.868 --> 06:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:14.788 --> 06:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:19:16.468 --> 06:19:16.478 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
this bill is a sensible measure designed
 
06:19:21.430 --> 06:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
to keep guns out of the hands of felons
 
06:19:24.150 --> 06:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
and other prohibited parties
 
06:19:26.230 --> 06:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
currently anyone purchasing a firearm
 
06:19:29.110 --> 06:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
from a federally licensed firearm dealer
 
06:19:30.708 --> 06:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
is required to pass a criminal
 
06:19:32.548 --> 06:19:32.558 align:start position:0%
background check
 
06:19:35.430 --> 06:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
according to the fbi roughly 92 percent
 
06:19:37.350 --> 06:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
of those checks are rendered almost
 
06:19:40.150 --> 06:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
instantly and at the same time any risk
 
06:19:42.310 --> 06:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
to public safety safety
 
06:19:44.468 --> 06:19:44.478 align:start position:0%
is minimized because the process lowers
 
06:19:46.868 --> 06:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
the risk of a person prohibited from
 
06:19:49.910 --> 06:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
owning a gun from getting a gun simply
 
06:19:52.070 --> 06:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
by walking into a gun shop with a credit
 
06:19:52.080 --> 06:19:53.590 align:start position:0%
by walking into a gun shop with a credit
card

06:19:53.590 --> 06:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
card
 
06:19:53.600 --> 06:19:54.948 align:start position:0%
card
however

06:19:54.948 --> 06:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
the federal law on background checks
 
06:19:59.350 --> 06:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
only applies to sales conducted by
 
06:20:01.750 --> 06:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
federally licensed
 
06:20:03.670 --> 06:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
firearm dealers
 
06:20:05.670 --> 06:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
this situation effectively exempts
 
06:20:08.390 --> 06:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
commercial transactions between private
 
06:20:08.400 --> 06:20:09.990 align:start position:0%
commercial transactions between private
parties

06:20:09.990 --> 06:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
parties
 
06:20:12.468 --> 06:20:12.478 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do is close that gap
 
06:20:13.990 --> 06:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
in ways that allow
 
06:20:15.910 --> 06:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
sensible exemptions
 
06:20:17.830 --> 06:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
selling a gun to someone you personally
 
06:20:17.840 --> 06:20:19.030 align:start position:0%
selling a gun to someone you personally
know

06:20:19.030 --> 06:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:20:21.030 --> 06:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
the sale is exempt as long as that
 
06:20:24.390 --> 06:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
person isn't a prohibited party
 
06:20:26.868 --> 06:20:26.878 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically focuses on
 
06:20:29.270 --> 06:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
commercial sales and exchanges to
 
06:20:33.190 --> 06:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
parties not known by the seller
 
06:20:35.030 --> 06:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
please push the red button so another
 
06:20:36.868 --> 06:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
motion can be made
 
06:20:41.830 --> 06:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:43.190 --> 06:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
the member from salem representative
 
06:20:44.948 --> 06:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
abbas is recognized to speak in support
 
06:20:46.468 --> 06:20:46.478 align:start position:0%
of the committee report and will
 
06:20:48.070 --> 06:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
somebody in the back swing the interim
 
06:20:49.430 --> 06:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
doors shut
 
06:20:50.948 --> 06:20:50.958 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that members take their
 
06:20:52.708 --> 06:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
conversations out there it does not help
 
06:20:56.150 --> 06:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:57.670 --> 06:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:59.270 --> 06:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:21:00.868 --> 06:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
i rise in support of the committee's
 
06:21:02.230 --> 06:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation of inexpedient to
 
06:21:02.240 --> 06:21:05.670 align:start position:0%
recommendation of inexpedient to
legislate

06:21:05.670 --> 06:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:07.350 --> 06:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill there is some
 
06:21:09.510 --> 06:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
confusing language in this bill and you
 
06:21:11.670 --> 06:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
may have this is a familiar bill we had
 
06:21:13.510 --> 06:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
it last term for those who are in the
 
06:21:14.868 --> 06:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
body last term
 
06:21:16.390 --> 06:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
and first it
 
06:21:18.708 --> 06:21:18.718 align:start position:0%
defines a commercial sale to include a
 
06:21:21.510 --> 06:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
gift or any type of exchange
 
06:21:23.030 --> 06:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
including private exchange so when you
 
06:21:24.468 --> 06:21:24.478 align:start position:0%
read the exceptions
 
06:21:27.270 --> 06:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
section which is on page two
 
06:21:30.390 --> 06:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
well it says non-commercial sales
 
06:21:32.070 --> 06:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
i did not know what that meant last time
 
06:21:33.510 --> 06:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
i read this bill i still don't know what
 
06:21:34.788 --> 06:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
it means today whether that exception
 
06:21:36.628 --> 06:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
would apply to a gift or a private gift
 
06:21:39.830 --> 06:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:41.670 --> 06:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
under existing law today there are
 
06:21:43.190 --> 06:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
federal background checks that are done
 
06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
whenever there is a
 
06:21:46.868 --> 06:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
commercial sale done and when i say
 
06:21:48.150 --> 06:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
commercial said i mean you go to a store
 
06:21:49.830 --> 06:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
and purchase it from a licensed firearm
 
06:21:49.840 --> 06:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
and purchase it from a licensed firearm
dealer

06:21:52.070 --> 06:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
dealer
 
06:21:53.270 --> 06:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
the issue really is what do these
 
06:21:58.070 --> 06:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:59.830 --> 06:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
there was information provided to the
 
06:21:59.840 --> 06:22:00.868 align:start position:0%
there was information provided to the
committee

06:22:00.868 --> 06:22:00.878 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:22:03.350 --> 06:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
that out of the people who are
 
06:22:05.430 --> 06:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited from possessing a firearm
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
06:22:09.910 --> 06:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
of those individuals 99 of those people
 
06:22:12.390 --> 06:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
actually acquire those firearms either
 
06:22:14.230 --> 06:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
through an illegal straw purchase which
 
06:22:16.230 --> 06:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
is when someone
 
06:22:17.830 --> 06:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
intentionally purchases a firearm for
 
06:22:19.750 --> 06:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
someone knowing that that person's not
 
06:22:21.350 --> 06:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to have one or
 
06:22:24.468 --> 06:22:24.478 align:start position:0%
they bought it illegally on the street
 
06:22:26.628 --> 06:22:26.638 align:start position:0%
it deals with the one percent excuse me
 
06:22:28.948 --> 06:22:28.958 align:start position:0%
it deals with the 99
 
06:22:28.958 --> 06:22:29.910 align:start position:0%
it deals with the 99
of

06:22:29.910 --> 06:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:22:31.670 --> 06:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
those illegal ones this bill actually
 
06:22:35.030 --> 06:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:38.070 --> 06:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:39.510 --> 06:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
when we hear about we're trying to
 
06:22:41.030 --> 06:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
prevent handgun violence and we're
 
06:22:43.110 --> 06:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent people who are not
 
06:22:45.270 --> 06:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to possess firearms
 
06:22:46.708 --> 06:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
who are not allowed to we're not
 
06:22:48.708 --> 06:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
focusing on the overwhelming majority of
 
06:22:51.590 --> 06:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
the issue being raised by the bill
 
06:22:51.600 --> 06:22:53.510 align:start position:0%
the issue being raised by the bill
however

06:22:53.510 --> 06:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:22:55.350 --> 06:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
the issues and we heard a lot of
 
06:22:56.948 --> 06:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
testimony about background checks where
 
06:22:58.230 --> 06:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
someone was not allowed to have a
 
06:22:59.990 --> 06:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
firearm under the law but still managed
 
06:23:02.868 --> 06:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
to get a firearm in their possession
 
06:23:05.430 --> 06:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
in those situations examples provided to
 
06:23:07.430 --> 06:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
us the person did
 
06:23:09.750 --> 06:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
there was a background checks performed
 
06:23:10.868 --> 06:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
and for whatever reason there was a
 
06:23:12.708 --> 06:23:12.718 align:start position:0%
failure of the background check system
 
06:23:14.708 --> 06:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
that is was operated by the federal
 
06:23:14.718 --> 06:23:15.830 align:start position:0%
that is was operated by the federal
government

06:23:15.830 --> 06:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:23:18.468 --> 06:23:18.478 align:start position:0%
which we have no control over
 
06:23:18.478 --> 06:23:19.430 align:start position:0%
which we have no control over
so

06:23:19.430 --> 06:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:23:21.430 --> 06:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
i would say that the intent of this bill
 
06:23:23.030 --> 06:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps even well intended it does not
 
06:23:24.390 --> 06:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
accomplish any of the objectives
 
06:23:26.070 --> 06:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee
 
06:23:27.990 --> 06:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
for that reason i ask you to join me in
 
06:23:29.590 --> 06:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
pushing that green button and support
 
06:23:31.110 --> 06:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
the committee's recommendation of index
 
06:23:35.270 --> 06:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
being to legislate thank you mr speaker
 
06:23:37.270 --> 06:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative burt requests a roll call
 
06:23:40.390 --> 06:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded
 
06:23:42.310 --> 06:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
06:23:43.830 --> 06:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote members please take
 
06:25:00.390 --> 06:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:02.390 --> 06:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order
 
06:25:03.990 --> 06:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative muse is recognized for
 
06:25:10.150 --> 06:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:11.830 --> 06:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:25:13.670 --> 06:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
if i know that firearms background
 
06:25:15.590 --> 06:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
checks can keep guns out of the hands of
 
06:25:17.590 --> 06:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
felons and bad actors under protective
 
06:25:19.750 --> 06:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
orders and if i know that this bill
 
06:25:22.150 --> 06:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
closes a key loophole in our laws
 
06:25:24.628 --> 06:25:24.638 align:start position:0%
requiring the involvement of a licensed
 
06:25:26.868 --> 06:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
firearms dealer to perform a background
 
06:25:28.948 --> 06:25:28.958 align:start position:0%
check for commercial sales between
 
06:25:30.390 --> 06:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
private parties

composition and requiring yearly reports
 
06:30:41.670 --> 06:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
and if i know that we have had
 
06:30:43.510 --> 06:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
a significant growth in the number of
 
06:30:45.430 --> 06:30:45.440 align:start position:0%

and if i know the charter school program
 
06:30:59.270 --> 06:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
should have legislative oversight
 
06:31:01.270 --> 06:31:01.280 align:start position:0%

if i know education freedom account

any student receiving public funds
 
06:57:32.628 --> 06:57:32.638 align:start position:0%

06:58:07.990 --> 06:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
if i know that it requires efa students
 
06:58:09.670 --> 06:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
to take the public school state
 
06:58:12.548 --> 06:58:12.558 align:start position:0%

agree with the majority report the
 
07:00:36.310 --> 07:00:36.320 align:start position:0%

07:00:58.150 --> 07:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
1120.
 
07:01:00.868 --> 07:01:00.878 align:start position:0%
bill is really about two things
 
07:01:03.350 --> 07:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
quality of instruction and student
 
07:01:03.360 --> 07:01:04.548 align:start position:0%

as they apply to students participating
 
07:01:10.948 --> 07:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
in the education freedom account program
 
07:01:13.510 --> 07:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
many minority members of house ed along
 
07:01:15.750 --> 07:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
with their constituents have expressed
 
07:01:18.310 --> 07:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
numerous concerns regarding the
 
07:01:21.910 --> 07:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
qualification and background checks of
 
07:01:24.070 --> 07:01:24.080 align:start position:0%

house bill 1120 addresses a number of
 
07:01:35.670 --> 07:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
these concerns most specifically
 
07:01:35.680 --> 07:01:36.788 align:start position:0%
these concerns most specifically
assuring

07:01:36.788 --> 07:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
assuring

what the bill requires would not be
 
07:02:43.270 --> 07:02:43.280 align:start position:0%

on administrative rules when discussing
 
07:03:40.150 --> 07:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
the education freedom accounts program

the education freedom accounts program
said

07:03:41.350 --> 07:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
said
 
07:03:44.310 --> 07:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
there is no provision in the statute to
 
07:03:47.750 --> 07:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
require that education service providers
 
07:03:50.868 --> 07:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
get a criminal background check
 
07:03:53.190 --> 07:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
and no stipulation that a negative
 
07:03:56.390 --> 07:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
background check will result in a bar
 
07:03:58.230 --> 07:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
from participation
 
07:04:00.468 --> 07:04:00.478 align:start position:0%
in the efa program
 
07:04:03.110 --> 07:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
if these are needed the statute will
 
07:04:05.590 --> 07:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
need to be amended
 
07:04:05.600 --> 07:04:06.390 align:start position:0%
need to be amended
so

07:04:06.390 --> 07:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:04:09.510 --> 07:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
i stand before you today because efas
 
07:04:10.628 --> 07:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
are here
 
07:04:12.788 --> 07:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
and they need some work
 
07:04:14.948 --> 07:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
regardless of how any of us feel about
 
07:04:17.430 --> 07:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
the impact of the program on our ability
 
07:04:20.788 --> 07:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
to fund existing public schools
 
07:04:23.990 --> 07:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
we currently have almost 2 000 kids
 
07:04:26.868 --> 07:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
participating in a program that has
 
07:04:29.510 --> 07:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
inadequate guard rails
 
07:04:31.510 --> 07:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
financial stability
 
07:04:34.708 --> 07:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
measurable educational standards health
 
07:04:36.548 --> 07:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
and safety first
 
07:04:38.948 --> 07:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
no criminals with kids
 
07:04:41.670 --> 07:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
surely these are not revolutionary or
 
07:04:44.390 --> 07:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
objectionable goals
 
07:04:46.868 --> 07:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we have put the cart
 
07:04:48.548 --> 07:04:48.558 align:start position:0%
before the horse
 
07:04:50.708 --> 07:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
and that this program went into effect
 
07:04:52.788 --> 07:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
before we had the opportunity to work
 
07:04:55.030 --> 07:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
out all the kinks
 
07:04:57.350 --> 07:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's now going to take all of us to move
 
07:04:59.110 --> 07:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
that horse
 
07:05:01.030 --> 07:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
please vote no on the majority
 
07:05:03.750 --> 07:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation of itl so that another
 
07:05:05.270 --> 07:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
motion may be made
 
07:05:08.150 --> 07:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:05:09.990 --> 07:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
we're on the final speaker
 
07:05:11.670 --> 07:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative mullen has requested a
 
07:05:16.150 --> 07:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:18.230 --> 07:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
it is officially seconded
 
07:05:19.910 --> 07:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
members will take their seats we're on
 
07:05:21.830 --> 07:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
the final call we're on the final
 
07:05:21.840 --> 07:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
the final call we're on the final

07:05:26.548 --> 07:05:26.558 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative cordelli
 
07:05:29.030 --> 07:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:05:31.510 --> 07:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
this bill wasn't was written in relation
 
07:05:33.510 --> 07:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
to a voucher program
 
07:05:36.390 --> 07:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
but we all know that there are no
 
07:05:38.468 --> 07:05:38.478 align:start position:0%
vouchers in new hampshire
 
07:05:40.150 --> 07:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
we have an education freedom account
 
07:05:43.110 --> 07:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
program that provides provides a variety
 
07:05:46.468 --> 07:05:46.478 align:start position:0%
of education options for parents not
 
07:05:49.030 --> 07:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
just going to a different school
 
07:05:52.868 --> 07:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
the litany of states you just heard
 
07:05:54.310 --> 07:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
they were all
 
07:05:57.030 --> 07:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
in relation to voucher programs where a
 
07:05:59.430 --> 07:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
voucher is given to a student to go to a
 
07:06:02.390 --> 07:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
particular school
 
07:06:04.230 --> 07:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
hp 1120
 
07:06:05.670 --> 07:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
would require
 
07:06:07.350 --> 07:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts service
 
07:06:10.150 --> 07:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
providers to have a proven academic
 
07:06:12.948 --> 07:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
success success record and have
 
07:06:14.628 --> 07:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
07:06:17.510 --> 07:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
if an efa student is going to let's say
 
07:06:18.948 --> 07:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
a private school
 
07:06:20.868 --> 07:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
that would be the case
 
07:06:23.350 --> 07:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
there would be background checks
 
07:06:25.110 --> 07:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
and it all sounds good
 
07:06:28.070 --> 07:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
but with the education freedom accounts

07:15:30.548 --> 07:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:15:33.430 --> 07:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't wear them don't require the mass
 
07:15:36.788 --> 07:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
or or do require the mass they are taken
 
07:15:38.548 --> 07:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
before the code of conduct by the
 
07:15:40.390 --> 07:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
07:15:41.670 --> 07:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
and they lose their teacher
 
07:15:41.680 --> 07:15:43.830 align:start position:0%
and they lose their teacher
certification

07:15:43.830 --> 07:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
certification
 
07:15:45.670 --> 07:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
this is double jeopardy
 
07:15:47.670 --> 07:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
and that's why i would like this part of
 
07:15:47.680 --> 07:15:48.628 align:start position:0%
and that's why i would like this part of
the

07:15:48.628 --> 07:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:15:51.030 --> 07:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
bill removed through this amendment
 
07:15:52.788 --> 07:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
so that teachers would not be put in
 
07:15:55.190 --> 07:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
this situation where they're damned if
 
07:15:57.270 --> 07:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
they do and damned if they don't so
 
07:16:01.750 --> 07:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:03.750 --> 07:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
there is going to be a division vote on
 
07:16:05.830 --> 07:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment so members will be taking
 
07:16:08.230 --> 07:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
their seats we're at the last speaker
 
07:16:12.948 --> 07:16:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:16.628 --> 07:16:16.638 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh would as the previous
 
07:16:18.150 --> 07:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
speaker said
 
07:16:20.150 --> 07:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
remove the responsibility of the
 
07:16:23.430 --> 07:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
educator to follow the law
 
07:16:25.670 --> 07:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
so essentially a district would never
 
07:16:25.680 --> 07:16:26.868 align:start position:0%
so essentially a district would never
actually

07:16:26.868 --> 07:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
actually
 
07:16:30.150 --> 07:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
make a mask policy if this bill passes
 
07:16:30.160 --> 07:16:31.190 align:start position:0%
make a mask policy if this bill passes
because

07:16:31.190 --> 07:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:16:33.030 --> 07:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
that would be illegal
 
07:16:35.350 --> 07:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
so therefore if an educator like a
 
07:16:37.510 --> 07:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
principal or a teacher
 
07:16:40.708 --> 07:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
decides to violate this law
 
07:16:40.718 --> 07:16:41.670 align:start position:0%
decides to violate this law
and

07:16:41.670 --> 07:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:16:43.990 --> 07:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
implement a mask policy they should be
 
07:16:52.628 --> 07:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:54.788 --> 07:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative blasic requests the roll

07:16:59.110 --> 07:16:59.120 align:start position:0%

a roll call vote on the amendment
 
07:17:27.350 --> 07:17:27.360 align:start position:0%

07:23:18.070 --> 07:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
they may risk losing their teaching

credential their license
 
07:23:23.110 --> 07:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
their very livelihood by violating the

code of conduct
 
07:23:26.788 --> 07:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
this is making an employee choose
 
07:23:28.548 --> 07:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
between getting fired
 
07:23:30.628 --> 07:23:30.638 align:start position:0%

07:23:35.030 --> 07:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is the true definition of double

this is the true definition of double

07:23:36.548 --> 07:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
jeopardy
 
07:23:39.910 --> 07:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
that is the sledgehammer approach
 
07:23:41.990 --> 07:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is an extreme measure to block a
 
07:23:44.788 --> 07:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
common proven public health procedure to
 
07:23:46.468 --> 07:23:46.478 align:start position:0%

diseases
 
07:23:49.750 --> 07:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is an extreme measure that attacks
 
07:23:52.070 --> 07:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
schools and teachers
 
07:23:53.990 --> 07:23:54.000 align:start position:0%

unprecedented circumstances
 
07:23:59.110 --> 07:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
this is an extreme measure that puts
 
07:24:00.948 --> 07:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
schools in double jeopardy of meeting
 
07:24:03.510 --> 07:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
their responsibility of keeping students
 
07:24:05.910 --> 07:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
and staff as safe as they can
 
07:24:07.830 --> 07:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
under the guidance of the chief medical
 
07:24:10.070 --> 07:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
officer of our state and the governor's

i urge you to vote red
 
07:24:22.948 --> 07:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
so that an otp
 
07:24:26.230 --> 07:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
on on the otp for this so an itl can be

sufficiently seconded
 
07:24:39.190 --> 07:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this is
 
07:24:41.510 --> 07:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a roll call vote rem members

thank you mr speaker
 
07:24:51.990 --> 07:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
hb 1131 as amended is first and foremost
 
07:24:54.388 --> 07:24:54.398 align:start position:0%
a parental rights bill
 
07:24:56.948 --> 07:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
it allows parents in public schools to
 
07:24:58.788 --> 07:24:58.798 align:start position:0%
make the best choice for their child in
 
07:25:01.430 --> 07:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
regards to facial coverings

proponents of universal mass mandates in
 
07:25:03.920 --> 07:25:04.948 align:start position:0%
proponents of universal mass mandates in
schools

07:25:04.948 --> 07:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
schools
 
07:25:07.270 --> 07:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
have yet to conclusively prove that mass
 
07:25:09.990 --> 07:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
are helpful and that they do no harm
 
07:25:12.708 --> 07:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
to date there have been no randomized
 
07:25:15.590 --> 07:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
clinical control trials of masks in
 
07:25:17.350 --> 07:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
children in masks
 
07:25:19.190 --> 07:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
champions of mass mandates might cite
 
07:25:22.150 --> 07:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
the bangladesh study that not only used
 
07:25:24.628 --> 07:25:24.638 align:start position:0%
was riddled with severe design flaws but
 
07:25:26.708 --> 07:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
also found that cloth mass which are the
 
07:25:28.868 --> 07:25:28.878 align:start position:0%
mass used by the majority of students in
 
07:25:32.070 --> 07:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
schools had no effect and surgical mass
 
07:25:34.868 --> 07:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
had a statistically insignificant effect
 
07:25:37.190 --> 07:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
they might also cite the recent cdc
 
07:25:39.110 --> 07:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
promoted survey study of schools but
 
07:25:42.628 --> 07:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
again this study was severely flawed
 
07:25:44.150 --> 07:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
of thousands of people surveyed they
 
07:25:45.750 --> 07:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
only got four tenths of one percent
 
07:25:47.110 --> 07:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
response rate
 
07:25:49.190 --> 07:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
coveted uh cases were based on contact
 
07:25:51.590 --> 07:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
tracing but in many locations if the
 
07:25:53.750 --> 07:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
student was masked they were not traced
 
07:25:56.150 --> 07:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
and overall they found a significant
 
07:25:58.310 --> 07:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
rise in all infections in the
 
07:26:00.230 --> 07:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
mass-mandated schools
 
07:26:02.388 --> 07:26:02.398 align:start position:0%
the list of flawed studies goes on from
 
07:26:04.310 --> 07:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
there but suffice it to say that there
 
07:26:06.070 --> 07:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
is no conclusive evidence that we are
 
07:26:08.788 --> 07:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
helping the students the teachers or the
 
07:26:11.110 --> 07:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
community by forcing children to wear
 
07:26:11.120 --> 07:26:12.548 align:start position:0%
community by forcing children to wear
masks

07:26:12.548 --> 07:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
masks
 
07:26:14.788 --> 07:26:14.798 align:start position:0%
but over the last two years papers have
 
07:26:16.948 --> 07:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
started to emerge showing harms to
 
07:26:19.030 --> 07:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
children there are now studies showing
 
07:26:21.510 --> 07:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
the physical emotional psychological and
 
07:26:23.990 --> 07:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
educational detriments to children from
 
07:26:25.670 --> 07:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
mass mandates
 
07:26:27.350 --> 07:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
testimony in the hearing for this bill
 
07:26:29.350 --> 07:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
was heart-wrenching as parents shared
 
07:26:31.910 --> 07:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
their stories including a child who
 
07:26:33.670 --> 07:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
attempted suicide
 
07:26:35.030 --> 07:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
and extreme
 
07:26:36.388 --> 07:26:36.398 align:start position:0%
anxiety was a
 
07:26:38.948 --> 07:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
contributing factor to her depression
 
07:26:40.548 --> 07:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
numerous speech pathologists wrote
 
07:26:42.388 --> 07:26:42.398 align:start position:0%
testimony about the severe speech
 
07:26:44.150 --> 07:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
development harms they are seeing from
 
07:26:44.160 --> 07:26:45.910 align:start position:0%
development harms they are seeing from
masking

07:26:45.910 --> 07:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
masking
 
07:26:48.388 --> 07:26:48.398 align:start position:0%
this cannot be allowed to continue any
 
07:26:51.350 --> 07:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
longer we are not conferring any benefit
 
07:26:53.270 --> 07:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
to these students by forcing them to
 
07:26:55.350 --> 07:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
wear a mask and we are potentially
 
07:26:56.788 --> 07:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
harming them
 
07:26:58.868 --> 07:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
dhhs recently changed their indoor
 
07:27:00.788 --> 07:27:00.798 align:start position:0%
masking guidance and doe and the
 
07:27:02.230 --> 07:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
governor announced that the school
 
07:27:05.030 --> 07:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
systems had to drop their mass mandates
 
07:27:07.910 --> 07:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
but to date some districts still have
 
07:27:10.310 --> 07:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
mask requirements and refuse to drop
 
07:27:10.320 --> 07:27:11.190 align:start position:0%
mask requirements and refuse to drop
them

07:27:11.190 --> 07:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
07:27:13.190 --> 07:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
in addition several school systems have
 
07:27:15.270 --> 07:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
pledged to mask the children every
 
07:27:18.310 --> 07:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
winter for cold and flu season
 
07:27:20.388 --> 07:27:20.398 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote ought to pass on this
 
07:27:22.948 --> 07:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can finally end the
 
07:27:25.430 --> 07:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
unscientific and potentially harmful
 
07:27:27.990 --> 07:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
mandates and allow parents to make the
 
07:27:31.430 --> 07:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
best decisions for their children
 
07:27:33.990 --> 07:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
07:27:58.388 --> 07:27:58.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:04.868 --> 07:28:04.878 align:start position:0%

07:28:10.468 --> 07:28:10.478 align:start position:0%
mullen for a parliamentary inquiry
 
07:28:12.310 --> 07:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
07:28:15.750 --> 07:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that this bill as
 
07:28:15.760 --> 07:28:16.788 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that this bill as
written

07:28:16.788 --> 07:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
written
 
07:28:19.670 --> 07:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
eliminates the superintendent of schools
 
07:28:22.388 --> 07:28:22.398 align:start position:0%
from the public school chain of command
 
07:28:24.708 --> 07:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
of decision making
 
07:28:27.190 --> 07:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that it ignores the board of
 
07:28:31.270 --> 07:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
directors at the chartered public school
 
07:28:33.750 --> 07:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
and if i know that this bill opens up
 
07:28:36.388 --> 07:28:36.398 align:start position:0%
the possibility of civil litigation by
 
07:28:39.030 --> 07:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
any aggrieved party towards a school
 
07:28:41.670 --> 07:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
school district school board or other
 
07:28:45.350 --> 07:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
public education agency and weaponizes
 
07:28:48.388 --> 07:28:48.398 align:start position:0%
the teacher code of conduct
 
07:28:50.548 --> 07:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
and if i believe that the unintended
 
07:28:53.750 --> 07:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
consequences of encouraging litigation
 
07:28:55.750 --> 07:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
over collaboration
 
07:28:58.628 --> 07:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
will shortchange both our students and
 
07:29:01.430 --> 07:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
our constituents would i now push the
 
07:29:03.670 --> 07:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
red button to oppose the majority
 
07:29:08.070 --> 07:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation of otpa thank you

for parliamentary inquiry thank you mr
speaker

07:29:13.910 --> 07:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
07:29:15.910 --> 07:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
if i know that the state has said that
 
07:29:18.868 --> 07:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
masks should be an individual choice
 
07:29:20.788 --> 07:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
if i know that there was an error on the
 
07:29:23.030 --> 07:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
pink sheet on this bill
 
07:29:25.910 --> 07:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
if i know that for too long schools have
 
07:29:29.670 --> 07:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
ignored the education impact and harm to
 
07:29:32.788 --> 07:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
children of wearing masks all day
 
07:29:35.830 --> 07:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
and if i agree with the recent headline
 
07:29:38.310 --> 07:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
the educational cost of face mask
 
07:29:41.750 --> 07:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
coverings is far better established than
 
07:29:44.150 --> 07:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
the benefits of mandates
 
07:29:46.628 --> 07:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
what i now say enough is enough
 
07:29:51.110 --> 07:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:56.310 --> 07:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:58.468 --> 07:29:58.478 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority

thank you mr speaker

hb 1132
 
07:32:56.230 --> 07:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is not focused on improving
 
07:32:59.670 --> 07:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
public education not one iota
 
07:33:01.830 --> 07:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
which is surprising to me as it came
 
07:33:03.190 --> 07:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
from the chair
 
07:33:05.270 --> 07:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the education committee the havel

of the education committee the havel
representative

07:33:06.948 --> 07:33:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:33:08.468 --> 07:33:08.478 align:start position:0%
you think
 
07:33:10.388 --> 07:33:10.398 align:start position:0%
that education improvement and
 
07:33:12.708 --> 07:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
accountability would be the primary
 
07:33:12.718 --> 07:33:14.230 align:start position:0%
accountability would be the primary
focus

07:33:14.230 --> 07:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
focus
 
07:33:14.240 --> 07:33:15.270 align:start position:0%
focus
nope

07:33:15.270 --> 07:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
nope
 
07:33:16.788 --> 07:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
not in this bill
 
07:33:18.628 --> 07:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact
 
07:33:21.190 --> 07:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't help families on vouchers on
 
07:33:23.510 --> 07:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
education saving accounts or even home
 
07:33:23.520 --> 07:33:24.788 align:start position:0%
education saving accounts or even home
schoolers

07:33:24.788 --> 07:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
schoolers
 
07:33:26.468 --> 07:33:26.478 align:start position:0%
none of those groups
 
07:33:28.388 --> 07:33:28.398 align:start position:0%
have taken a priority which have taken a
 
07:33:31.830 --> 07:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:35.030 --> 07:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
and concerns in this session
 
07:33:37.510 --> 07:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
seem to be accounted so what does a
 
07:33:39.750 --> 07:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
charter school conversion
 
07:33:41.830 --> 07:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
bill really mean and do
 
07:33:41.840 --> 07:33:42.868 align:start position:0%
bill really mean and do
first

07:33:42.868 --> 07:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
first
 
07:33:46.150 --> 07:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
it means that a few people can show up
 
07:33:48.548 --> 07:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
or even pack a regular annual meeting of
 
07:33:49.910 --> 07:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
the school board
 
07:33:51.670 --> 07:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
we know how many sometimes come to those
 
07:33:51.680 --> 07:33:52.468 align:start position:0%
we know how many sometimes come to those
meetings

07:33:52.468 --> 07:33:52.478 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
07:33:53.830 --> 07:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
not many
 
07:33:56.548 --> 07:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
and then vote to convert
 
07:33:59.990 --> 07:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
a school one school not all the schools
 
07:34:02.230 --> 07:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
not every school in the district just
 
07:34:03.910 --> 07:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
one school
 
07:34:07.510 --> 07:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
so let's use town x elementary school
 
07:34:09.510 --> 07:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
so this small group of citizens of the
 
07:34:09.520 --> 07:34:10.548 align:start position:0%
so this small group of citizens of the
town

07:34:10.548 --> 07:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
town
 
07:34:13.430 --> 07:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
vote to convert town x elementary school
 
07:34:15.190 --> 07:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
to a charter
 
07:34:16.788 --> 07:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
in the current law
 
07:34:19.430 --> 07:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
as it stands now this can happen
 
07:34:22.230 --> 07:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
but the teachers must want in
 
07:34:24.948 --> 07:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
the school principal must contour
 
07:34:27.110 --> 07:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
the superintendent gets a voice and of
 
07:34:29.990 --> 07:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
course the locally elected school board
 
07:34:32.468 --> 07:34:32.478 align:start position:0%
the people's representative
 
07:34:34.468 --> 07:34:34.478 align:start position:0%
why would you want all those people to
 
07:34:36.708 --> 07:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
buy into a plan and agree to make it
 
07:34:36.718 --> 07:34:38.310 align:start position:0%
buy into a plan and agree to make it
work

07:34:38.310 --> 07:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
work
 
07:34:39.350 --> 07:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that are
 
07:34:40.948 --> 07:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
responsible for the hard work and the
 
07:34:42.868 --> 07:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
effort that will be needed to make this
 
07:34:42.878 --> 07:34:44.388 align:start position:0%
effort that will be needed to make this
work

07:34:44.388 --> 07:34:44.398 align:start position:0%
work
 
07:34:46.230 --> 07:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
in the days that charter schools were
 
07:34:49.430 --> 07:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
first created it was by the teachers who
 
07:34:51.910 --> 07:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to create a school maybe one with
 
07:34:54.388 --> 07:34:54.398 align:start position:0%
a thematic mission or math and science
 
07:34:57.430 --> 07:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
stem or focus on arts and other areas it
 
07:34:59.750 --> 07:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
was the teachers that created the school
 
07:34:59.760 --> 07:35:01.190 align:start position:0%
was the teachers that created the school
but

07:35:01.190 --> 07:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:35:02.868 --> 07:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
07:35:04.548 --> 07:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
those educators that want to work
 
07:35:06.948 --> 07:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
creatively outside the boundaries of the
 
07:35:09.510 --> 07:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
traditional school structure
 
07:35:11.990 --> 07:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
those who want to build a better school
 
07:35:13.750 --> 07:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
are not even in the loop
 
07:35:16.708 --> 07:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
the administrators not even considered
 
07:35:19.270 --> 07:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
and yep no superintendent oversight or
 
07:35:21.270 --> 07:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
support required
 
07:35:24.788 --> 07:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
when asked in testimony of the sponsor
 
07:35:27.750 --> 07:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
why we want this bill what would it do
 
07:35:31.910 --> 07:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
well the answer was it would save money
 
07:35:33.750 --> 07:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
no need for library staff we can use the
 
07:35:35.990 --> 07:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
town library phys that instruction will
 
07:35:38.628 --> 07:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
be at local couples clubs and teams
 
07:35:40.868 --> 07:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like a sound educational
 
07:35:43.110 --> 07:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
reason to me
 
07:35:46.548 --> 07:35:46.558 align:start position:0%
so the teachers in this school x
 
07:35:48.948 --> 07:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
they can come but be transferred but
 
07:35:51.590 --> 07:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
they can't stay in their current union
 
07:35:52.788 --> 07:35:52.798 align:start position:0%
they can't stay in their current
 
07:35:52.798 --> 07:35:54.468 align:start position:0%
they can't stay in their current
association

07:35:54.468 --> 07:35:54.478 align:start position:0%
association
 
07:35:56.868 --> 07:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact it's a charter
 
07:35:56.878 --> 07:35:57.750 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact it's a charter
school

07:35:57.750 --> 07:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:36:00.150 --> 07:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
only 50 percent of the teachers i even
 
07:36:02.150 --> 07:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
need to be certified
 
07:36:04.230 --> 07:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
custodians administrative assistants
 
07:36:07.270 --> 07:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
school nurse yep they can come but they
 
07:36:09.270 --> 07:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
can't stay in their association or union
 
07:36:09.280 --> 07:36:10.468 align:start position:0%
can't stay in their association or union
either

07:36:10.468 --> 07:36:10.478 align:start position:0%
either
 
07:36:12.788 --> 07:36:12.798 align:start position:0%
so let's see
 
07:36:15.190 --> 07:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
the new trustees not the elected school
 
07:36:17.590 --> 07:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
board members will negotiate a new pay
 
07:36:20.548 --> 07:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
wage benefits conditions and the staff
 
07:36:23.190 --> 07:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
will take it or leave it
 
07:36:24.868 --> 07:36:24.878 align:start position:0%
so to summarize
 
07:36:27.030 --> 07:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
take all educators and professionals out
 
07:36:28.548 --> 07:36:28.558 align:start position:0%
of the decision
 
07:36:30.310 --> 07:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
bust all the unions
 
07:36:32.070 --> 07:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
hire only half the number of certified
 
07:36:34.230 --> 07:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
teachers outsource the use of town
 
07:36:36.388 --> 07:36:36.398 align:start position:0%
facilities and the support staff be
 
07:36:36.398 --> 07:36:39.110 align:start position:0%
facilities and the support staff be
necessary

07:36:39.110 --> 07:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:40.948 --> 07:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but that sure
 
07:36:42.788 --> 07:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like a sound educational
 
07:36:45.510 --> 07:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
model for teachers staff parents and the
 
07:36:45.520 --> 07:36:46.948 align:start position:0%
model for teachers staff parents and the
students

07:36:46.948 --> 07:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
students
 
07:36:49.030 --> 07:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
is that a school that you want your
 
07:36:51.990 --> 07:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
child or grandchild to attend
 
07:36:53.030 --> 07:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
07:37:01.830 --> 07:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:04.310 --> 07:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're down to our last speaker
 
07:37:07.510 --> 07:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
and this is going to be a division vote
 
07:37:09.990 --> 07:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
so the sooner members take their seats
 
07:37:12.708 --> 07:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
the sooner we can continue moving on
 
07:37:14.548 --> 07:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
members take your seats this is going to

07:37:28.788 --> 07:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
yeah rather than the teachers
 
07:37:30.310 --> 07:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
07:37:32.388 --> 07:37:32.398 align:start position:0%
the people who live in the town the
 
07:37:32.398 --> 07:37:33.830 align:start position:0%
the people who live in the town the
taxpayers

07:37:33.830 --> 07:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
07:37:36.708 --> 07:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
the parents the parents of the students
 
07:37:39.030 --> 07:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
they'd be the ones making the decisions
 
07:37:41.190 --> 07:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
and any of the teachers superintendent
 
07:37:43.190 --> 07:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
principal who lived in the town they'd
 
07:37:45.190 --> 07:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
be making the decisions too
 
07:37:47.750 --> 07:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
because this would put it to a vote of
 
07:37:51.110 --> 07:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
the people in the town and a two-thirds
 
07:37:56.868 --> 07:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:59.190 --> 07:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
the member has a right to be heard
 
07:38:01.190 --> 07:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
i understand everybody's coming into the
 
07:38:03.670 --> 07:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
chamber do it quietly
 
07:38:05.830 --> 07:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
member may continue
 
07:38:08.150 --> 07:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
we put it to a two-thirds vote of the
 
07:38:10.708 --> 07:38:10.718 align:start position:0%
residents of the town
 
07:38:13.270 --> 07:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
and it is the resident's school
 
07:38:15.110 --> 07:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
the student school
 
07:38:16.628 --> 07:38:16.638 align:start position:0%
and those are the ones who should be
 
07:38:19.270 --> 07:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
making the decision but the other part
 
07:38:21.830 --> 07:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
of that is the charter schools if you
 
07:38:23.830 --> 07:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
want a charter school
 
07:38:25.750 --> 07:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
it does have different rules they're
 
07:38:28.788 --> 07:38:28.798 align:start position:0%
much looser and if the school's not
 
07:38:31.590 --> 07:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
working i think the taxpayers and the
 
07:38:33.830 --> 07:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
parents should be able to choose
 
07:38:35.830 --> 07:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
something that they believe will work a
 
07:38:36.948 --> 07:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
lot better
 
07:38:39.190 --> 07:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
07:38:42.468 --> 07:38:42.478 align:start position:0%
for the ch for the for the children as
 
07:38:45.430 --> 07:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to for the teachers unions this
 
07:38:47.990 --> 07:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
is for the children
 
07:38:51.750 --> 07:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:54.070 --> 07:38:54.080 align:start position:0%

charter school conversion process
 
07:40:27.910 --> 07:40:27.920 align:start position:0%

baseball fans i'm sure watch the world

chief nakahoma lived in a teepee outside
the

08:05:06.230 --> 08:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:05:08.150 --> 08:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
yellowfield fence and when a brave hit a
 
08:05:10.070 --> 08:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
home run chief nakahoma would come out
 
08:05:13.270 --> 08:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
of his teepee and he'd do a war dance
 
08:05:15.510 --> 08:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
and at the same time brave fans some of
 
08:05:18.310 --> 08:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
you seen this on television such as
 
08:05:20.868 --> 08:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
jimmy carter ted turner jane fonda would
 
08:05:23.990 --> 08:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
do a tomahawk chop tomahawk being like
 
08:05:25.750 --> 08:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
an indian hatchet
 
08:05:28.388 --> 08:05:28.398 align:start position:0%
now eventually indigenous native
 
08:05:30.388 --> 08:05:30.398 align:start position:0%
american indians were successful in
 
08:05:33.110 --> 08:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
raising awareness that this was cultural
 
08:05:34.948 --> 08:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
appropriation that this was offensive
 
08:05:36.388 --> 08:05:36.398 align:start position:0%
you'll notice
 
08:05:39.750 --> 08:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
that jane fonda ted turner jimmy carter
 
08:05:42.708 --> 08:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
no longer do the tomahawk chalk
 
08:05:45.190 --> 08:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
chief nakahoma has retired he's gone
 
08:05:47.750 --> 08:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
away and this happened without a law
 
08:05:49.670 --> 08:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
this happened because people talked to
 
08:05:51.910 --> 08:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
each other people raised awareness that
 
08:05:54.388 --> 08:05:54.398 align:start position:0%
this was offensive
 
08:05:56.868 --> 08:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
stepping away from disrespectful
 
08:05:58.708 --> 08:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
cultural appropriation
 
08:06:00.548 --> 08:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
is fine and good
 
08:06:01.910 --> 08:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
and again
 
08:06:05.190 --> 08:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to require a law
 
08:06:09.270 --> 08:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
laws such as proposed in hb 1261 which
 
08:06:11.590 --> 08:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
claims that uses of indigenous native
 
08:06:14.310 --> 08:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
american symbology creates
 
08:06:15.590 --> 08:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
in quote
 
08:06:18.628 --> 08:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
an unsafe learning environment
 
08:06:21.030 --> 08:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
an unsafe learning environment
 
08:06:21.040 --> 08:06:22.548 align:start position:0%
an unsafe learning environment
really

08:06:22.548 --> 08:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
really
 
08:06:23.910 --> 08:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
there were mascots and there were
 
08:06:25.590 --> 08:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
nicknames and there were symbols they're
 
08:06:28.070 --> 08:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
not all the same chief nakahoma was a
 
08:06:30.388 --> 08:06:30.398 align:start position:0%
mascot he has gone away i'm glad he's
 
08:06:32.548 --> 08:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
gone away
 
08:06:34.628 --> 08:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
most of us are okay with his retirement
 
08:06:37.910 --> 08:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
but most folks are also okay
 
08:06:39.990 --> 08:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
with other symbols and nicknames
 
08:06:41.990 --> 08:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
including most indigenous native
 
08:06:44.628 --> 08:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
american indians who appreciate
 
08:06:47.510 --> 08:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
who appreciate the associations and are
 
08:06:50.708 --> 08:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
honored by these associations a sports
 
08:06:53.750 --> 08:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
illustrated survey
 
08:06:56.708 --> 08:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
a few years ago found that 80 percent 80

08:07:01.510 --> 08:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
favored
 
08:07:03.430 --> 08:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
and appreciated
 
08:07:05.910 --> 08:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
being honored with the associations that
 
08:07:08.388 --> 08:07:08.398 align:start position:0%
they had with sports teams
 
08:07:09.910 --> 08:07:09.920 align:start position:0%

08:07:20.868 --> 08:07:20.878 align:start position:0%
disappointed and saddened that the

cleveland indians
 
08:07:26.388 --> 08:07:26.398 align:start position:0%
and other cleveland guardians
 
08:07:28.868 --> 08:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
it's it's troubling to many that that
 
08:07:31.430 --> 08:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
activists seem uninterested in in in
 
08:07:33.750 --> 08:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
communicating and compromise you know it
 
08:07:35.270 --> 08:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be all or nothing we
 
08:07:37.990 --> 08:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't need to issue and get rid of all
 
08:07:43.030 --> 08:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:45.990 --> 08:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
his favorite colleges dean wermer once
 
08:07:49.910 --> 08:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
famously said no more fun for anyone
 
08:07:51.510 --> 08:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
this measure
 
08:07:52.708 --> 08:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
is also
 
08:07:55.750 --> 08:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
a clear violation of our first amendment
 
08:07:57.590 --> 08:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee of freedom of expression i'll
 
08:07:59.830 --> 08:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
say that again because it's important
 
08:08:01.110 --> 08:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
08:08:04.468 --> 08:08:04.478 align:start position:0%
to many of us is a clear violation of
 
08:08:06.628 --> 08:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
our first american
 
08:08:08.628 --> 08:08:08.638 align:start position:0%
our first amendment's guarantee of
 
08:08:10.788 --> 08:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
freedom of expression
 
08:08:12.310 --> 08:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
and further
 
08:08:14.868 --> 08:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
this was and should remain a local
 
08:08:16.230 --> 08:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
control issue
 
08:08:18.468 --> 08:08:18.478 align:start position:0%
teams from my merrimack valley school
 
08:08:21.350 --> 08:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
district used to be known as the indians
 
08:08:24.788 --> 08:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
now they're the the blue prime
 
08:08:26.868 --> 08:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
this came about

the state
 
08:08:39.590 --> 08:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
via this proposed statute would quash
 
08:08:41.830 --> 08:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
such local discussions with all its
 
08:08:44.868 --> 08:08:44.878 align:start position:0%

that local dialogue occur
 
08:09:09.430 --> 08:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
the good folks at

longer wanted to be marauders
 
08:09:15.510 --> 08:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
marauders aren't even indians but
 
08:09:17.590 --> 08:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's i'm not from hanover
 
08:09:19.750 --> 08:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
they chose to be bears
 
08:09:24.948 --> 08:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:09:27.190 --> 08:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
speaking of hanover
 
08:09:28.708 --> 08:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
it's the home as most of you know of
 
08:09:30.628 --> 08:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
dartmouth it used to be the dartmouth
 
08:09:32.070 --> 08:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
indians why were they the dartmouth
 
08:09:34.070 --> 08:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
indians because dartmouth was founded in
 
08:09:35.388 --> 08:09:35.398 align:start position:0%
hanover in
 
08:09:35.398 --> 08:09:37.110 align:start position:0%
hanover in
1769

08:09:37.110 --> 08:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
1769
 
08:09:39.590 --> 08:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
as a school to educate indigenous native
 
08:09:41.350 --> 08:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
american indians there's a historical
 
08:09:43.510 --> 08:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
tie there a proud historical tie and
 
08:09:45.990 --> 08:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
when dartmouth issued
 
08:09:48.230 --> 08:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
the indian as their symbol from all over
 
08:09:49.430 --> 08:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
the country
 
08:09:51.750 --> 08:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
native american chiefs expressed their
 
08:09:53.270 --> 08:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
dismay and their disappointment that
 
08:09:55.110 --> 08:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
this historical connection to dartmouth
 
08:09:55.120 --> 08:09:56.388 align:start position:0%
this historical connection to dartmouth
was

08:09:56.388 --> 08:09:56.398 align:start position:0%
was
 
08:09:56.398 --> 08:09:57.350 align:start position:0%
was
was

08:09:57.350 --> 08:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
08:10:00.388 --> 08:10:00.398 align:start position:0%
assumed as i put it
 
08:10:00.398 --> 08:10:01.350 align:start position:0%
assumed as i put it
so

08:10:01.350 --> 08:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:10:03.110 --> 08:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
activists are even going after nicknames
 
08:10:05.430 --> 08:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
like the warriors now warriors
 
08:10:08.388 --> 08:10:08.398 align:start position:0%
is fairly generic um
 
08:10:10.110 --> 08:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
our good friend from londonderry and
 
08:10:12.468 --> 08:10:12.478 align:start position:0%
c333 is a warrior and he's an
 
08:10:14.070 --> 08:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
italian-american not even a native
 
08:10:17.430 --> 08:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
american warriors is not necessarily
 
08:10:19.110 --> 08:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
indigenous and yet
 
08:10:21.030 --> 08:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
people winter kind of wars or whatever
 
08:10:21.040 --> 08:10:22.070 align:start position:0%
people winter kind of wars or whatever
that

08:10:22.070 --> 08:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:10:24.388 --> 08:10:24.398 align:start position:0%
warriors could be greek whatever
 
08:10:26.948 --> 08:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
so this is going far beyond
 
08:10:29.110 --> 08:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
native american symbology
 
08:10:31.830 --> 08:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
so we already have too many laws i say
 
08:10:33.830 --> 08:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
many of us say let's not add another one
 
08:10:35.510 --> 08:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
that would be an unconstitutional
 
08:10:36.948 --> 08:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
infringement of first amendment
 
08:10:39.190 --> 08:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
protections of freedom of speech freedom
 
08:10:41.430 --> 08:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
of expression while also taking away
 
08:10:43.590 --> 08:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
local control
 
08:10:45.270 --> 08:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
and those teaching
 
08:10:45.280 --> 08:10:46.388 align:start position:0%
and those teaching
moments

08:10:46.388 --> 08:10:46.398 align:start position:0%
moments
 
08:10:47.990 --> 08:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
that we could use again chief and
 
08:10:50.070 --> 08:10:50.080 align:start position:0%

08:18:08.868 --> 08:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
heck i even rode across the united
 
08:18:10.948 --> 08:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
states on a motorcycle raising money for
 
08:18:12.548 --> 08:18:12.558 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans
 
08:18:14.548 --> 08:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
but in each case
 
08:18:16.468 --> 08:18:16.478 align:start position:0%
each case from the outset the mission of
 
08:18:18.948 --> 08:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
the organization and the requirements
 
08:18:21.510 --> 08:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't change halfway through
 
08:18:23.190 --> 08:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
needy families
 
08:18:25.030 --> 08:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
are needy families
 
08:18:27.990 --> 08:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
food is secure students are hungry
 
08:18:29.190 --> 08:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
and they don't know where the next meal
 
08:18:32.150 --> 08:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
is coming from and their food is secure
 
08:18:35.030 --> 08:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
low income is low income and a disabled
 
08:18:37.670 --> 08:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
vet is a disabled vet
 
08:18:39.430 --> 08:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
but this bill plays games with that
 
08:18:42.070 --> 08:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
concept of transparency
 
08:18:45.270 --> 08:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
the sponsor the sponsor said and i quote
 
08:18:48.388 --> 08:18:48.398 align:start position:0%
this legislation makes one simple change
 
08:18:49.750 --> 08:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
in a program
 
08:18:52.468 --> 08:18:52.478 align:start position:0%
it changes the income income eligibility
 
08:18:55.030 --> 08:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
gap from three hundred percent to five
 
08:18:57.270 --> 08:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of the federal poverty
 
08:18:57.280 --> 08:18:58.230 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of the federal poverty
level

08:18:58.230 --> 08:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
level
 
08:19:00.230 --> 08:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
one simple change
 
08:19:02.548 --> 08:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
that means in simple language
 
08:19:04.948 --> 08:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
a family of four in new hampshire with
 
08:19:06.868 --> 08:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
an income of about seventy nine thousand
 
08:19:10.070 --> 08:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
dollars would qualify for a tax credit
 
08:19:12.308 --> 08:19:12.318 align:start position:0%
scholarship sounds reasonable
 
08:19:13.830 --> 08:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
especially considering the current
 
08:19:16.388 --> 08:19:16.398 align:start position:0%
minimum wage the cost of housing food
 
08:19:16.398 --> 08:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
minimum wage the cost of housing food
insurance

08:19:17.510 --> 08:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
08:19:19.110 --> 08:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
but when the number jumps to five
 
08:19:20.468 --> 08:19:20.478 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
08:19:22.388 --> 08:19:22.398 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about a family of four
 
08:19:22.398 --> 08:19:23.230 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about a family of four
with

08:19:23.230 --> 08:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
08:19:26.308 --> 08:19:26.318 align:start position:0%
132 thousand dollars income
 
08:19:28.388 --> 08:19:28.398 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound like a low income to
 
08:19:28.398 --> 08:19:29.350 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound like a low income to
me

08:19:29.350 --> 08:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
me
 
08:19:30.868 --> 08:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
that's way above the median new
 
08:19:33.670 --> 08:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire income of around 79 000 for a
 
08:19:34.830 --> 08:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
family of
 
08:19:37.270 --> 08:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
four last year
 
08:19:39.510 --> 08:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization
 
08:19:42.708 --> 08:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
had a waiting list at 300 percent they
 
08:19:44.230 --> 08:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
had a waiting list
 
08:19:46.628 --> 08:19:46.638 align:start position:0%
more students waiting than the number of
 
08:19:48.548 --> 08:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
students that they were able to provide
 
08:19:50.868 --> 08:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
scholarships for
 
08:19:50.878 --> 08:19:51.750 align:start position:0%
scholarships for
so

08:19:51.750 --> 08:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
08:19:53.830 --> 08:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
why if an organization
 
08:19:56.708 --> 08:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
can't fund the number of low-income
 
08:19:59.110 --> 08:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
eligible applications now
 
08:20:01.110 --> 08:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
why would we want to enlarge the pool of
 
08:20:01.120 --> 08:20:02.308 align:start position:0%
why would we want to enlarge the pool of
applicants

08:20:02.308 --> 08:20:02.318 align:start position:0%
applicants
 
08:20:04.708 --> 08:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
and further why would we want to expand
 
08:20:07.430 --> 08:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
it to families that are making almost 50
 
08:20:10.230 --> 08:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
000 more a year than those at 300
 
08:20:12.388 --> 08:20:12.398 align:start position:0%
percent level
 
08:20:14.230 --> 08:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
this organization was established to
 
08:20:17.190 --> 08:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
provide scholarships to low income
 
08:20:19.430 --> 08:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
families period
 
08:20:22.070 --> 08:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
by the way during the testimony there
 
08:20:23.590 --> 08:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
were not any statements from the
 
08:20:25.510 --> 08:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
organization or cell phone
 
08:20:28.388 --> 08:20:28.398 align:start position:0%
representative indicating that all
 
08:20:30.708 --> 08:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
or most or half
 
08:20:32.708 --> 08:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
the low income families would be
 
08:20:35.030 --> 08:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
serviced first before the high rank of
 
08:20:35.040 --> 08:20:36.788 align:start position:0%
serviced first before the high rank of
families

08:20:36.788 --> 08:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
families
 
08:20:39.350 --> 08:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
this shouldn't be a bait and switch and
 
08:20:41.750 --> 08:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
once again the poorest families of our
 
08:20:44.548 --> 08:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
state are cast aside to make room for
 
08:20:46.548 --> 08:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
those less needy
 
08:20:48.788 --> 08:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
this program was set up to serve the
 
08:20:50.868 --> 08:20:50.878 align:start position:0%
needy the low income
 
08:20:52.948 --> 08:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
once that mission is filled and there
 
08:20:55.670 --> 08:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
are no more waiting lists maybe maybe
 
08:20:57.830 --> 08:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's the time to change or perhaps
 
08:21:01.350 --> 08:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
even a larger scholarships but not now
 
08:21:03.190 --> 08:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
when the organization the education
 
08:21:04.948 --> 08:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
08:21:08.070 --> 08:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
can't even fund the number of
 
08:21:10.388 --> 08:21:10.398 align:start position:0%
youngsters that are eligible why would
 
08:21:12.388 --> 08:21:12.398 align:start position:0%
we change
 
08:21:14.788 --> 08:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
we can't fund those folks so please
 
08:21:17.750 --> 08:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
folks vote no now is not the time to
 
08:21:20.388 --> 08:21:20.398 align:start position:0%
reduce aid to those that need us the
 
08:21:27.430 --> 08:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:21:29.990 --> 08:21:30.000 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
08:21:49.430 --> 08:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
the education tax credit program relies
 
08:21:51.750 --> 08:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
on donations from businesses and
 
08:21:54.708 --> 08:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
individuals in exchange for tax credit
 
08:21:58.708 --> 08:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
there is no public money involved
 
08:22:00.948 --> 08:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
and what is the program benefit
 
08:22:03.270 --> 08:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
scholarships are awarded to students to

hampshire qualify for that
 
08:23:03.670 --> 08:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
but too often
 
08:23:05.990 --> 08:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
government programs provide for

and i want to be clear about the effect
 
08:23:19.830 --> 08:23:19.840 align:start position:0%

number and amount of donations
 
08:23:26.948 --> 08:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
there will have to be a significant
 
08:23:29.190 --> 08:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
increase in donations for any child to
 
08:23:31.270 --> 08:23:31.280 align:start position:0%

poverty or less
 
08:23:46.628 --> 08:23:46.638 align:start position:0%
last year that percentage was 68 percent
 
08:23:48.788 --> 08:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
if the increase will not help anyone
 
08:23:50.230 --> 08:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
right away
 
08:23:52.308 --> 08:23:52.318 align:start position:0%
