00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
well good morning mr chair members of
 
00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh for the record steve smith director
 
00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
of artists for the lba
 
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
on the first the first one board of
 
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
dental examiners
 
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
i think realistically
 
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
where we're at in the process with not
 
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
only the board but the oplc
 
00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
we're looking at probably not a fiscal
 
00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 align:start position:0%
presentation until september
 
00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's been quite a ordeal and lengthy
 
00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
process to get through this with them
 
00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.189 align:start position:0%
process to get through this with them
um

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
if i can expand on that if the committee
 
00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
would like but that's sort of where
 
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
we're targeting right now our goal is to
 
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh a draft that's been
 
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
vetted by us
 
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.950 align:start position:0%
vetted by us
internally

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
internally
 
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
to the board and oplc by the end of this
 
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.990 align:start position:0%
to the board and oplc by the end of this
month

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
and it's going to take at least a couple
 
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
of months for them to to get through it
 
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
we just received the very last initial
 
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.990 align:start position:0%
we just received the very last initial
response

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
on an observation from the board that
 
00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
was outstanding since i believe august
 
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
we just got it so
 
00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 align:start position:0%
working as you as you're familiar with
 
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
working with boards they're volunteers
 
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
they only meet once a month
 
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
it appears they they're only dealing
 
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
with the audit at these meetings along
 
00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
with the rest of their business
 
00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
and and the responses that we're getting
 
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
um are not in the
 
00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
condition that we would like to see in
 
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 align:start position:0%
terms of a degree of concurrence
 
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
coherency completeness
 
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
what they intend to do immediately
 
00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
actually so we're trying to work with
 
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
them to to get a better
 
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh a better product but um
 
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
so that's that's kind of where we're at
 
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
so any questions on that or
 
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
so any questions on that or
okay

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
the next three uh bullets there mental
 
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
health department of energy and and
 
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 align:start position:0%
special education um we're gonna be
 
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
if you if you would like we'll present
 
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
the scope statements that we have um
 
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.350 align:start position:0%
the scope statements that we have um
prepared

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.470 align:start position:0%
prepared
um

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
and we can certainly do that but we're
 
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
continuing with our our planning
 
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.509 align:start position:0%
and uh
and

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
with approval of the sculpt stakes we'll
 
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
soon be into field work on those
 
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
the last bullet there the medical
 
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
subsidy we we we had completed our work
 
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
and we drafted a letter as what we're
 
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
calling it not a report
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
and we vetted that through department
 
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
administrative services and the new
 
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire retirement system
 
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
we just
 
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
got uh confirmation from them that
 
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're fine with what we had produced
 
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
so now we'll be uh giving that to mike
 
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
kane for his uh distribution to
 
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
legislative leadership so that's where
 
00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
we stand with that one
 
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.190 align:start position:0%
we stand with that one
so

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
so unless there's any questions on on
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
any of those i'll
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
i would like to see
 
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things i would like to see on
 
00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.030 align:start position:0%
one of the things i would like to see on
both

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
mental health and special ed
 
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.390 align:start position:0%
mental health and special ed
is

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
the reason i guess these topics came up
 
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
we see continuing increases in these
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
areas so if we saw like a 10-year
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
number of patients and dollars spent
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh on both of those especially
 
00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
special ed and and we see that a decline
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
in overall students but seems like an
 
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
increase in special ed during a 10-year
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
period and and the money of course it
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
just keeps going up and up so
 
00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
i think that would be an interesting
 
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
piece of those two audits that we could
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
see what's happening in the progress and
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
then the question comes why
 
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that's something that your
 
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
auditors will be able to find
 
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.830 align:start position:0%
auditors will be able to find
sure

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
i think the um
 
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
whatever they're calling it um
 
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.909 align:start position:0%
whatever they're calling it um
advocate

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:38.870 align:start position:0%
advocate
uh

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.749 align:start position:0%
uh
may

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.830 align:start position:0%
may
be

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
appointed prior to you finishing your
 
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.110 align:start position:0%
appointed prior to you finishing your
audit

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
audit
 
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.030 align:start position:0%
audit
and

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
i think that
it's

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
important when we look at dispute
 
00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.790 align:start position:0%
important when we look at dispute
resolution

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
as well as costs that if you have an
 
00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
touch base with that new office
 
00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
to see what their
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts are
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
on where
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
these things should go i appreciate it
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
steve

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
steve
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that i have is is in
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
the mental health workforce
 
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.350 align:start position:0%
the mental health workforce
is

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
what has been referred to me and i can't
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
verify this as a seemingly very high
 
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
number of clinical hours required before
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
certification is achievable
 
00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
compared to other states and that other
 
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
states have
 
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
if you will stair steps up to full
 
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
certification so that a person that has
 
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
reached a certain level of hours under
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
supervision can do certain things
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'd certainly like to see something
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
addressing that that's factual if so
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
steve the um there are two agencies ncsl
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
and csg that that are working on
 
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.590 align:start position:0%
and csg that that are working on
reciprocity

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
for these certifications
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
any any
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
chance to to let us know what's going on
 
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.070 align:start position:0%
chance to to let us know what's going on
there

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of the licensing of the states
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
the reciprocity here
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
how about how we um
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
take each one of these scope statements
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
individually and then we can
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
handle them and maybe maybe some of the
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
background work maybe i can someone can
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
better than i can answer your question
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you okay thank you
 
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is villa skids i'll
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
be the auditor in charge of this uh the
 
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
mental health audit
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
um so to answer your question um
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
reciprocity is an area that we are
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
looking at um you know it's been kind of
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
brought to our attention that mobility
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
of licensure is probably the biggest
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
kind of movement within the entire
 
00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:21.759 align:start position:0%
nation right now so we are looking at
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
certain reciprocity agreements we're
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.070 align:start position:0%
looking at
um

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
what are they called the the compacts so
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
there's a psychology compact now and
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
there are other compacts that are being
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
developed as well so
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
for one question mr chairman um a
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
council of state governments i know they
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
had a national task force working on
 
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
had a national task force working on
reciprocity

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.189 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
and

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
what just wondered how far
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
how far that's going because that would
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
take care of a lot of difficulties that
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
we see if
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
if people could uh transfer the license
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
right now we've been looking at what uh
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
work has been done through the ncsl
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
right now but uh we can certainly add uh
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
other areas that are looking at
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and mobility of licensure
 
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
for sure i think ncsl and csg have some
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
cooperation in this in this area
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
sure uh senator guida if you look in our
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
scope statement there are a couple of
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
tables in the back i believe they are
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
pages four and five
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh we have started looking at some of
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
those hours
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
and we've
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
looked at the new england state so far
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
we will be looking at other pockets
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
within the country as well
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
we kind of envisioned doing a sample of
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
certain states in the northwest in the
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
south and that type of stuff to look at
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
the number of hours
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
new england right now
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
i have those numbers for practical hours
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
and also to address a comment that you
 
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
had also made senator gaida about
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
certain steps within the professions
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
where you can have certain number of
 
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.829 align:start position:0%
where you can have certain number of
hours

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
social work has established those steps
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
it was put into law in october 2021
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
where there are a couple of lower steps
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
where you can kind of start at
 
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.829 align:start position:0%
where you can kind of start at
get

00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
a get licensed at that level and then as
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
you build up your
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
hours of supervision and your hours
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
practical hours you can in education as
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
well then you can move up to the next
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
many of the problems
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
with licensing
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
that we have excessive requirements
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
which acts as protection for the people
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
who are employed in those areas now
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
and it calls for legislation
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
to change it
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that's my
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
16-year observation on e-dna
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
to what's happening
 
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
to what's happening
so

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
do you want a motion to accept the
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
statement do we need to do that at this
 
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.470 align:start position:0%
statement do we need to do that at this
point

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
weatherization

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
is somebody to present something on
 
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:51.110 align:start position:0%
is somebody to present something on
weatherization

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is john clinch
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
i'm a senior audit manager with the
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
office of legislative budget assistant
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
i believe in your packet you've got a
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
i can go through it if you want just
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
briefly the weatherization program is
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
run by the department of energy formerly
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
the office of strategic initiatives in
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's office
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
and it serves low-income individuals who
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
also qualify fuel for a fuel assistance
 
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.430 align:start position:0%
also qualify fuel for a fuel assistance
program

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
and other programs within
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
services that are performed by the
 
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh we're proposing uh doing it out at
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
scope of did the
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
weatherization assistance program
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively
 
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
monitors the provision of the
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
weatherization services by the community
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
action agencies during state fiscal
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
years 2019 through 2022.
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh with that i am open to any questions
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
some of these recent federal programs
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
have they added a lot of money to the
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
this particular program
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh the one that i'm aware of uh was a
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
weatherization um they're looking at
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
moving 18 million dollars through the
 
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.230 align:start position:0%
moving 18 million dollars through the
program

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh the normal the pro program is
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
normally 1.6 million or so
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a significant uh
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
increase uh that uh they're seeing this
 
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.509 align:start position:0%
increase uh that uh they're seeing this
year

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if they've got plans in
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
place for um delivering services for
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
that 18 million yet or not
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
but i know that's in the works it'll be
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
interesting if you find that much need
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
because you know all of a sudden
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
somebody's doing the job down the street
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
oh what about me right
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
so thank you i'm glad you're taking this
 
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.389 align:start position:0%
so thank you i'm glad you're taking this
on

00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
morning good to see everybody paige
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
lorenz audit manager and auditor in
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
charge for the dispute resolution audit
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
uh currently we do not have an audit
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
manager assigned to the special
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
education audit overall as it notes due
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
to staffing we have to wait until one of
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
these other audits concludes
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
so our hope is to do the six
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
processes noted under the dispute
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
resolutions first it's much shorter and
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
we can do it with the current staffing
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
if there are any specific questions
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
about those processes or dispute
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
resolution in particular i can answer
 
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.670 align:start position:0%
resolution in particular i can answer
those

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
are you meeting resistance from any
 
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.189 align:start position:0%
are you meeting resistance from any
agencies

00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
about things with special education well
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
since neither audit topic has been
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
approved for special education we've
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
been relying on any public information
 
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
we only had a preliminary meeting with
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
so we haven't gotten into
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
the planning stages formally with the
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
background information you have in front
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
of you
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
what we plan on doing is uh using the
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholder surveys that have already
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
been sent out if we have to do a survey
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
ourselves we will do that
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
there's also the advocacy centers that
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
we'll work with and
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders that are identified
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
by the department i know that you
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
provided us a binder with all the
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
testimonies so we were able to review
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
that as well as our preliminary
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
background work do you understand all
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
the people you're contacting or what the
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
problem has been with special education
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
basically you're going you're going
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
you're headed in the wrong direction
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
looking for what the problem is
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
so the stakeholders we're looking at
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
because of the surveys that are sent out
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
are the people that have used the
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at the people who
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
have been involved
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
the parents themselves okay as part of
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
it it won't be limited to
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
the employees or the contracted
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
employees or the advocacy groups
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
have you found any happy people
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
there was a few happy testimonies that
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
we got from you
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate the binder back
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
yes we're confirming that everything's
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
been scanned actually today at the
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
office so we can give that back to you
 
00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
as soon as we've confirmed we have
 
00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:25.350 align:start position:0%
as soon as we've confirmed we have
everything

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with dispute
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
resolution is at the local level
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
and i know that you probably can't
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
go down to the local level to see what
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.189 align:start position:0%
the problem is
but

00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
once it reaches the state level
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
there have been a lot of ugly things
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
that have happened
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
at the local level
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
and so i don't know how
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
how we get to
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.069 align:start position:0%
trying to
see

00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
what kinds of problems
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
are existing
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
before it gets to the dispute resolution
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
sure so part of it will be the controls
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
that the state has over those processes
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat at the local level because of
 
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.389 align:start position:0%
somewhat at the local level because of
the

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
facilitated iep meetings are not
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
completely state controlled but they do
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
provide the facilitator and there are
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
requirements um there's also
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for reporting on
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
alternative dispute resolution processes
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
so we'll look at how the department
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
determines effectiveness in those areas
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
with our surveys and potentially
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
interviews reach out to those people at
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
the local level get a sample of those
 
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.590 align:start position:0%
the local level get a sample of those
people

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
they're never obligated to talk to us
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
however so
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
we can we can try and get that
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
and did you have anything else to add
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
i don't uh as i said with the larger
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
scoped audit it was our understanding it
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
was just a
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
broader issue and a lot of things that
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
the committee wanted to see so
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
i don't have any specific information on
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
that just what's here but
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions the department is
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
here if you wanted to ask about the
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
bigger audit or any particulars
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
so we have three
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
scopes that we have three scopes
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
topic

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.029 align:start position:0%
topic
weatherization

00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
weatherization
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
those are scope statements they've
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
already gone to fiscal this was approved
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
so now you're just proving the the scope
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
of the audit
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
the the special ed is different in that
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone to pistol yet um
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
though it you know it looks a lot like a
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
typical scope statement so
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
you could approve the special ed audit
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
we'll send it to fiscal this month
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
and if you're fine with what's already
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
written we could use that as the scope
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
statement and we don't have to come back
 
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.950 align:start position:0%
statement and we don't have to come back
here

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
unless you want us to come back and we
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
do the bigger on it
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
for the scope statement so that that's a
 
00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.909 align:start position:0%
for the scope statement so that that's a
possibility

00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
let's have a motion on the first two
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.630 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.430 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
and what do we want to say about the
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
i have a suggestion that we sort of
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
bifurcate the thing because it sounds
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
like we've got one piece that's ready to
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
go and ought to go because we know that
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
there are problems there
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion would be to
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay well i'm just going to suggest it
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
first before i make a motion so that if
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
heads start going this way we'll i'll
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
work on it and if heads go this way
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about it more
 
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.390 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about it more
um

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
i i guess i i would move that we approve
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
just the
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution process
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
and wait for more information on the
 
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.549 align:start position:0%
and wait for more information on the
other

00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:27.909 align:start position:0%
other
pieces

00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
because that way we've got something
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
very specific that can get going and
 
00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:32.390 align:start position:0%
very specific that can get going and
then

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
the other pieces can come along behind
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
and what are we talking about for the
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
hello my name is jay henry i'm the
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
performance audit supervisor with the
 
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.750 align:start position:0%
performance audit supervisor with the
lba

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
lba
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
we envisioned the second audit to be
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
more of your typical broad audit that's
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole bureau and a lot of
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
the functions that they do
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
um but that's going to take more staff
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
and time
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
um so in what we're
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
if you see the uh the scope statement
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
broad topics that we're going to look at
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
especially all the things that you've
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
told us over the last few meetings that
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
costs of the program and oversight of by
 
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.909 align:start position:0%
costs of the program and oversight of by
the

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
by the bureau of the local level
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
so i mean i think what you could do is
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
approve this
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
this pre-scope statement
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
we get we get the whole thing to fiscal
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
and in this scope statement we talk
 
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
and in this scope statement we talk
about

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
more than one audit
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
we envision more than one audit so you
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
sort of built that into the system
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
already so it's already sort of doing
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
what you're suggesting okay it's just
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
we'll do the first audit
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
the uh dispute resolution
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
we're ready to go with that
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
and when we get staff freed up
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be all set to start the
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
second one
 
00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.750 align:start position:0%
second one
so

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
could i amend my motion to say that i
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
move that we
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
proceed with the dispute resolution
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
portion immediately and with the other
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
portions with all deliberate speed when
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh personnel are available do we have a
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
second second i'm getting second any
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
discussion bob thank you mr chairman
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to somehow try to make sure
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
that the dispute resolution
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
audit gets down to the local level i
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
don't know how understandably they're
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
not required necessarily to answer
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
but we're wasting our time for not
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
getting to really the where the problem
 
00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.350 align:start position:0%
getting to really the where the problem
begins

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
begins
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
and so i don't know how we would do that
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
but i'd certainly be like like to see
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's why we have performance auditors
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
so they know how to do that
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think knowing what you'd like
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
us to do we will
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know in our methodology we'll have
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
to write an audit plan and part of that
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
will be how do we get at the the local
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
level and whether it's you know visiting
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
schools seeing if we can
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
we can probably talk to the
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
disability rights center which has some
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
as a stakeholder they may have an inroad
 
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.270 align:start position:0%
as a stakeholder they may have an inroad
to

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
the families
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
that are interested just like
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
the people who came to talk to the
 
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.310 align:start position:0%
the people who came to talk to the
committee

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
they might have the fewest complaints
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll also have the record but
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll have information from
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
the department of who has used all these
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
levels of um the resolution dispute
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
resolution so
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll be able to contact the
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
families through there
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
we just have to be careful with you know
 
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.710 align:start position:0%
we just have to be careful with you know
the

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's special ed information and
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
confidentiality but luckily our work
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
papers are
 
00:22:48.149 --> 00:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
confidential and just our statutes
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
require that we have to
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
be as careful as the department with all
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
that information
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
a question while you're pursuing this
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
audit i look down here at table one
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
specific learning disabilities is a 32
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
of the total
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
and how lengthy would that list be
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
um some of the things i've i've heard at
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
some of the schools are kind of
 
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.789 align:start position:0%
some of the schools are kind of
surprising

00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
surprising
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
when they talk about some of this
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
specific learning disabilities and
 
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
is this a growing list are they making
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
up new things every year and that's the
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
sort of thing i'm interested in it
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
and then you know obviously 32 it's it's
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
fairly lengthy list that if there is a
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
complete list i might like to see that
 
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.390 align:start position:0%
complete list i might like to see that
sometime

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's right and well
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
part of the art part of the bigger audit
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
is really looking at the data and that's
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
what you're really saying is how do they
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
capture this and
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
how much more detail is there behind it
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
on the uh special ed would it be
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
possible to list out
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
specific learning disabilities in other
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
words give us a comprehensive list of
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
everything along the lines with uh
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative wyler's concern
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
so we can see
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe a comparative list done from a
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
number of years back and one that's
 
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.070 align:start position:0%
number of years back and one that's
current

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
just to see what's growing and and how
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
and why
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
i think we could someone from the
 
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.070 align:start position:0%
i think we could someone from the
department

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.559 --> 00:24:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh but they're looking for a breakdown
 
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
if there's a checklist perhaps we could
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
just have a copy of the checklist and
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
that would give because i think what the
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee's looking for
 
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.190 align:start position:0%
committee's looking for
is

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
is a list of what kinds of specific
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities we're talking
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
about what what those diagnoses or
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
designations would be
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
so i do have samples we do not require
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
the districts to do a specific form but
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
we do review their forms so we do have
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
samples of every district's form for
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
determining a specific learning
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
disability i can share that with the
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
audit office or i can share it directly
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
with you if you would like
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
it has specific requirements that each
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
team needs to consider as they determine
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
a specific learning disability but a
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability is is um
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
it can be in any of the processes for
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
reading writing math and we wouldn't
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
know specifically what that is because
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
it's determined by an individual iep
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
team meeting we could go through and
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
read every iep we have access to those
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
but we wouldn't know um it's not a
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
determination that they they mark off on
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
the box when they when they determine
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry rebecca burdette i'm the
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
special ed director for the state
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you rebecca
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
one of the things i recall is i visited
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
a charter school and they pointed out a
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
couple of students that had ieps for
 
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.269 align:start position:0%
couple of students that had ieps for
anxiety

00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
anxiety
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
which had gone away once they come to
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
the charter school and i'm wondering
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
what sort of treatment you would get for
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
anxiety so an anxiety would fall under
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
another health impairment
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that it depends on the student
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
what's causing their anxiety or what's
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
recommended by the counselor or the
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
physician that has um diagnosed them
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
with anxiety and they might put in
 
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
accommodations or modifications to
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
provide supports for that student who
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
may have anxiety it has to be impacting
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
them educationally in order for them to
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
so

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
if i understood correctly what you said
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's no state overarching guidelines
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
for special ed it's kind of like
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
whatever district or a
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
teacher decides
 
00:27:43.919 --> 00:27:45.029 align:start position:0%
teacher decides
nope

00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
nope
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
we just we don't require a specific form
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
we do have very specific guidelines
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
about how you identify students what you
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
need for our students
 
00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:55.039 align:start position:0%
for example for a specific learning
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
disability we require that they have an
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
academic evaluation
 
00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.669 align:start position:0%
academic evaluation
an

00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
iq assessment is done an observation is
 
00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:04.559 align:start position:0%
done and
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
their hearing and vision is is screened
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
to rule it out as an issue that may be
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
impeding their learning so for each of
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
these disabilities that's listed here
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
there are specific evaluations that the
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
district needs to do to determine if
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
they're eligible and then the criteria
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
is is put forth to them but we don't
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
say your form should look like this or
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
we check to ensure that it has the
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
content that it needs um and ensure that
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a limiting practice so when
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
you're identifying somebody you're not
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
saying if they don't have this they
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't qualify that you're looking at all
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
the factors and so we check their forms
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they're not limiting and
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
that they do in fact meet the
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for that disability follow
 
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.029 align:start position:0%
requirements for that disability follow
up

00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr so would there be any
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
benefit to a standardized state form for
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
the purposes of data
 
00:28:50.799 --> 00:28:51.669 align:start position:0%
the purposes of data
uh

00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
collection and analysis
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
we could do a standardized form if that
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
i mean it wouldn't be i mean it would be
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
something we could add to our
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
information system if that's something
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
that we find that is needed um
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
i mean these are the these are all the
 
00:29:06.149 --> 00:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities it's just that that's the
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability has nuances
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
and that's not just in new hampshire it
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
just has the nuances of you have a
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
disability and how you learn and it
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
impacts different things so you have a
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
difficulty in learning math or you have
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
a difficulty in learning reading but
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's the same type of disability and
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's why it falls under that category
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
the last two years have been very
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
difficult for students
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
yes so so we got a situation where we
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
have two years of data that that are
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
going to be much different than anything
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
that that came before
 
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.430 align:start position:0%
that that came before
and

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
what i mean
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
could we evaluate the effect on kids
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
going forward and with
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
i it just it just seems to me
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
remote learning
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
highly problematic particularly
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
amongst a group of kids not attending
 
00:29:59.039 --> 00:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
amongst a group of kids not attending
school

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
and the absentee rate extremely high
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
so all of these
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
things i think have to be considered as
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
in that in that period of time yes they
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
and they do we do look at that in our
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
data and we're starting to analyze that
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
data we report a lot of what you're
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
asking for to the federal government um
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
and but we haven't really analyzed it
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
before so we have started to look at
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
those pieces and look at how that impact
 
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.070 align:start position:0%
those pieces and look at how that impact
is

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
we reach out to districts on a regular
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
basis to see what some of those things
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
is absenteeism um i will say that during
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
kovid the federal government did not
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
allow any allowances in in ida they had
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
to meet all the same tenants and all the
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
same requirements so there was no no way
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
you could say no we're not going to
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
provide this they had to provide all the
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
same things that they were providing
 
00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:44.789 align:start position:0%
same things that they were providing
before

00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
but they had to chase kids yes
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes since i i don't know how successful
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
they were in finding out where these
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
kids were what was happening and so
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
forth that that
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
dramatic problem i know we have the
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
largest school district in the state in
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
manchester i know the absentee rate was
 
00:31:05.909 --> 00:31:05.919 align:start position:0%
very high
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
particularly in certain in certain areas
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
i think that's a
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's created a very special problem
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
and of course some of what
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
senator's talking about
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
stems not from any disability on the
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
part of a student but
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
those of us from the rural areas had
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
kids who just could not under any
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
circumstances figure out any way to get
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
connected to anything
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
despite a fair amount of effort
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
is a whole nother factor that i'm not
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
sure we can quant i mean it's it's
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of this but i think
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
it's i think it's important to find and
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
i will just note one small thing is that
 
00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.029 align:start position:0%
i will just note one small thing is that
i

00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
do know of a couple of kids with anxiety
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
who actually prospered under the remote
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
learning because the social
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
anxiety that they felt in a classroom
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
was removed but they were also the kids
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
who were attending regularly doing the
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
work taking advantage of what was being
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
offered to them so it's it's a whole new
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
ball of wax
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think if i made i think that the
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
repercussions of that will go on for
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
several years because we really won't
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
see the impact in special education
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
for a few years down the road as
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
students start to get back into that and
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
so i think over the next few years we
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
so we have a request for a
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
performance audit of the education
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.389 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
i was just going to say i have i have a
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
list because i put out requests but that
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
one came back again from several people
 
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
asking if we could
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh figure out about that i mean for one
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
thing you know there was the initial
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
assumption of how many people would take
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of it and
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
the numbers turned out to be very
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
different and it would be a good thing
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
i also had a request about the um
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anybody
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
if you got any information on that
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
i agree i think that should be looked at
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
because i think that we weren't getting
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
all the information
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
could could you be a little more i know
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the immunization
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
program being on health and human
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
services but i'm
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the state
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
administered program which is now
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
gone by the wayside or i mean it would
 
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:00.870 align:start position:0%
gone by the wayside or i mean it would
be

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
we'd need to know what aspects we were
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
looking at would be my point
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
there was some thought that we weren't
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
seeing all the adverse effects and that
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
there was some pressure not to report
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
them and that sort of thing that um
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know it was interesting how much
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
was reported in this
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
country versus what was reported in
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
other countries such as other countries
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
are saying
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
more people died from the shot than from
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
the disease and yet in this country they
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
were saying no everybody that comes the
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
emergency room hasn't had this shot
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
which was adverse to what was hearing in
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
other countries so
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's odd that
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
that those things should differ so much
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question for the lba
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
so in senate education we amended the
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
effective date to push it out further i
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
don't remember the exact date off the
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
top of my head but can you tell me
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
does that amended future date work
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
better for audit purposes or would we
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
certainly i think it's october i'm not
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
mistaken i think um was it edna senate
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
edna just uh approved it
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
last week
 
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.670 align:start position:0%
last week
yes

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so the date the date now is october
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
1st 2023 when it becomes effective so we
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
would begin the audit at some point
 
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.990 align:start position:0%
would begin the audit at some point
either

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
around that time or after
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
so certainly the uh
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
the the longer into the future the more
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
information the more data the more
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
everything we have to evaluate
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
certainly an october date is better than
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
the original one which i think was july
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
um and just i'm sorry just make you
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
aware that this uh it this isn't
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
legislative so it's a house bill so
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
normally topics come to us through this
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee but in this particular case
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
this will be a topic that we will be
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
charged with statutorily if if if and
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
when it's approved so we're just making
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.470 align:start position:0%
um
i'm

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
not as familiar as 11 of 11 35 as i
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
but what are they asking
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
lba to audit
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
has something
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
is there something wrong with the
 
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.630 align:start position:0%
is there something wrong with the
program

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh i mean i realized that more people
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
applied than we
 
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.630 align:start position:0%
applied than we
anticipated

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.430 align:start position:0%
anticipated
but

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't know what
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
legislation said you should audit
 
00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.470 align:start position:0%
legislation said you should audit
um

00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's it performance out of the education
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
freedom account program
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
this should be included not limited to
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
initial and continued eligibility
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
controls for determining qualifying
 
00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:04.710 align:start position:0%
controls for determining qualifying
expenditures

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
identification and recovery of
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
ineligible disbursements
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
procedures and controls for transferring
 
00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.109 align:start position:0%
procedures and controls for transferring
funds

00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the scholarship organization
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
procedures and controls for phase out of
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
the grants
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
public reporting
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
participation student outcomes and
 
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.349 align:start position:0%
participation student outcomes and
expenditures

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
demographic information
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
about all that
 
00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.390 align:start position:0%
about all that
so

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
that does not sound to me like the
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
education freedom accounts it sounds to
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
me like the scholarship
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
account which is totally different
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
than efas
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
anyhow it
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's a uh because efa
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
the only
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know the child goes or gets accepted
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
and if uh
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
if it goes to a regular school they pay
 
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
if he homeschools yes or she
 
00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.190 align:start position:0%
if he homeschools yes or she
then

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
you know the money is given out
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
but on the scholarship
 
00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.910 align:start position:0%
but on the scholarship
side

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
there's a totally different process so i
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know where
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know where
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
this thought process came from but from
 
00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:26.710 align:start position:0%
this thought process came from but from
what

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
what was suggested there it doesn't
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
sound to me like it's efas but rather
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
whatever they call the scholarship csf
 
00:38:35.839 --> 00:38:36.790 align:start position:0%
whatever they call the scholarship csf
yeah

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
the scholarship program so i
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know i mean i'm just
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
maybe we can
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
figure that out
 
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.310 align:start position:0%
figure that out
um

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.349 align:start position:0%
um
because

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
we don't want you going down this rabbit
 
00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:52.390 align:start position:0%
we don't want you going down this rabbit
hole

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
hole
 
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
when you should go down
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
this other one so
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
i don't i just don't know
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
i just bring that up as a uh
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i have the same concern as uh
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
i've sat on ways and means for six years
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
and without exception every every two
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
years there's another attack
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
literally against
 
00:39:21.839 --> 00:39:22.950 align:start position:0%
literally against
these

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh csfs i think you call them
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
the data they have data every which way
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it requires a performance
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
audit but they have every kind of data
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
on demographics on amounts on who gets
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
income levels and all of that
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
ethnicities already available
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't know that it requires
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
performance audit and i would actually
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
be opposed to that because again i've
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
watched the attacks year after year on a
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
very successful program that helps a
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
great number of our
 
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.230 align:start position:0%
great number of our
less

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
financially fortunate to families and
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
children okay without encouraging debate
 
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:02.550 align:start position:0%
children okay without encouraging debate
yes

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just reading down a list here so
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
the debate has
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
come from other places that one sounds
 
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.710 align:start position:0%
come from other places that one sounds
like

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's not going very far so
 
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh the next one actually is is kind of
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
interesting given what you said about
 
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.630 align:start position:0%
interesting given what you said about
the

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
audit of the board of dental examiners
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
one of the suggestions that i had and
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is something that i hear from
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
people fairly regularly
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
is that they suggested an audit and we i
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
know we've done any number of the boards
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
but an audit of the office of
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
professional licensure itself
 
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.430 align:start position:0%
professional licensure itself
and

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.309 align:start position:0%
and
this

00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
is partially because
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's a freestanding entity with no
 
00:40:47.599 --> 00:40:49.430 align:start position:0%
it's it's a freestanding entity with no
actual

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
oversight over the oversight
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
we have complaints from various boards
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
who feel that
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure the
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
umbrella organization impinges on some
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the things which
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
the boards feel is their purview
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the feedback that i'm getting
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
and i know that this topic came up at
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
one point
 
00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:16.950 align:start position:0%
one point
when

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
the office was being completely
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
reorganized and we decided at that time
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
that we didn't want to do an audit
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
because they were being completely
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
reorganized it would be
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
counterproductive but i wonder if this
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
is the right time to bring that issue
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i uh
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
not for the sake of being obstinate but
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
oplc is still in a state of significant
 
00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:46.710 align:start position:0%
oplc is still in a state of significant
transition

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
and there's been a lot of this
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh very clearly the legislation that
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
i've been working on for six years now
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
with oplc continues to happen we have
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
several bills too this year that are
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
still reshaping oplc and its obligations
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities i think an audit at
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
this point would be premature it's been
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
that the oplc's uh
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
purview is the administrative oversight
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
of of of the actual application process
 
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
that they have no site no say in the
 
00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
that they have no site no say in the
actual

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
board certification requirements and
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
things like that but that's still being
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
worked out in legislation i think it
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
would be premature at this point
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
if i may
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
i i wonder if a performance audit might
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
help in the working out process just
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
how people are relating to each other
 
00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.470 align:start position:0%
how people are relating to each other
and

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
whether the direction that
 
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
i think most of us share
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
that concept of one's administrative and
 
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
one substantive
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
but as we all know those those two
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
things blend into each other a lot and i
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
wonder if it wouldn't be helpful
 
00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:58.390 align:start position:0%
wonder if it wouldn't be helpful
to

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
have professional auditors take a look
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
at that to find out
 
00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
particularly across a spectrum of boards
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
how that's how that's being implemented
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
and it might help the process going
 
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.870 align:start position:0%
and it might help the process going
forward

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
but if it's obviously if it's the will
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee to wait it's the will
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee to wait
 
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that's on the next
 
00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:23.589 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that's on the next
agenda

00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah if i may the um with the the um
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
pending border dental
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
um obviously
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
a big piece of that that we've looked at
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
is oplc operations and how
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
it interacts with the board the
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
understanding each each party has of the
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of each other
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
as well as just the the overall control
 
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.630 align:start position:0%
as well as just the the overall control
structure

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
which whether
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's gonna it's gonna be you'll be able
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
to get a sense as to how it interacts
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
with several of the boards
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
but specifically
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
the work is is with the board of dental
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
so one of the reasons that this report
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
is going to be very large and voluminous
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
oplc does play a big part of it and
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
there will be a lot of there's many
 
00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:12.630 align:start position:0%
there will be a lot of there's many
recommendations

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
observations specific the oplc in in
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
this and and so i think that you you
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
will get a sense
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
from our perspective of the oplc with
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
this report
 
00:44:23.119 --> 00:44:23.990 align:start position:0%
this report
so

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman could i suggest that we
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
just keep this on the list as as
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
something that shows up in our list of
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
things to to think about and wait until
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
that audit has come out and then
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
revisited at that time
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
i said we'll just put it on the agenda
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
i think two more um
 
00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:50.510 align:start position:0%
one is a suggestion
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:51.829 align:start position:0%
one is a suggestion
[Music]

00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
about the secretary of state's division
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
of archives and record management and my
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
individual who has been the acting
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
director of that for about 12 years
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
without having ever been the director
 
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.870 align:start position:0%
without having ever been the director
director

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
um and and about whom the person who
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
asked me about this spoke very highly
 
00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.430 align:start position:0%
asked me about this spoke very highly
but

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.550 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
he thought that it might be a good time
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
to look at that just in terms of
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures going forward
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
and taking a look at where we are now
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
and where
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
it might be helpful in in where we go in
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
the future so that's one i'd love to
 
00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.790 align:start position:0%
the future so that's one i'd love to
have

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
added to the list if there's any other
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
interest in it
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then my final one is and i'm not
 
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.670 align:start position:0%
and then my final one is and i'm not
sure

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
even how you do this but the topic was
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
presented to me
 
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.630 align:start position:0%
presented to me
as

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
public lake at lake access for the
 
00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:51.030 align:start position:0%
public lake at lake access for the
public

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
how does the public access
 
00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.470 align:start position:0%
how does the public access
our

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
area and i i have
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
no it
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't have anything except the
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
connecticut river in my district and and
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue i've thought about a
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
whole bunch so i i don't know even who
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
the people are who who
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
deal with that sort of thing but i
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring that up as an issue
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
because i certainly know that i sit in
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
the house and listen to people when
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
there are issues of lake access
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
they're always
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
really interesting topics so i wonder
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
what we're supposed to be doing about
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
getting the public to
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
public bodies of water and how we're
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
yeah there's actually i sit on a board
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
called the public water access advisory
 
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.190 align:start position:0%
called the public water access advisory
commission

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.230 align:start position:0%
commission
and

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
this is what we deal with um
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
so it might be appropriate to reach out
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner or the head i should
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
say the chair of that commission
 
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.309 align:start position:0%
say the chair of that commission
and

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that that would be a valuable
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
information source his name escapes me
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
at present it doesn't meet all that
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
often but
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
that would be a good resource
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:28.069 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:28.079 --> 00:47:30.470 align:start position:0%
that
ken

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
