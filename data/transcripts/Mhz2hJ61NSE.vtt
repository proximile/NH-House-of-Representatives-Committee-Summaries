presentation but it's really uh a list
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
of answers to the questions that that
 
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
you folks had um at the at the last uh
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
work session um last week and also a
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
list of uh project amendments which is a
 
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 align:start position:0%
blue sheet double-sided single sheet um
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about those in a few
 
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
minutes so
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
um do this the same way uh we did last
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
time so on slide one these were the the
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
discussion items uh that we heard from
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
from the last work session
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
um as and as part of the uh the the the
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
public hearing that we had uh questions
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
that came out so um on page two and
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
three was a list of
 
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
acronyms um so we it's the magic decoder
 
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
ring of what all these terms mean uh
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
that we just spew out uh un realizing
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
that most people don't know what they
 
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
mean so this is a a list of uh the
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
different uh acronyms that we use uh in
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
the the last presentation uh and in this
 
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
one as well split it out between uh
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
different entities different groups uh
 
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
some miscellaneous and then on sheet
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
three is sort of what all the funding
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
sources mean and the abbreviations
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
associated with the funding
 
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
associated with the funding
sources

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
sources
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
um and I would I would if you have any
 
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
questions along the way there's usually
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
just like one or two slides per topic so
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
moment okay please continue gentlemen
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
all right um discretionary grants we had
 
00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
some questions about what discretionary
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
grants uh are available um who's
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
received the grants uh either
 
00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
communities or the state and what we've
 
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
applied for um so on page four we have a
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
list of of some of these grants that um
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
are new to the
 
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
iig and um or renewed um maybe rebranded
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
uh from previous versions um these These
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
are broken out and you'll see that
 
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.790 align:start position:0%
are broken out and you'll see that
different

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
communities either either communities or
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
mpos or the state can apply for these
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
but not every single one so you take the
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
second one down safe routes and roads
 
00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:34.519 align:start position:0%
for all or I'm sorry the third one down
 
00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:37.479 align:start position:0%
um only a community or an Mo can apply a
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
state can't apply for those grants so
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
there's different flavors of grants for
 
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
different things and also there's
 
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
different restrictions on who can apply
 
00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:48.519 align:start position:0%
for these grants and we excuse me Mr
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
okay a question on safe Street say
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County is it can you give me an
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
idea what for what streets is that the
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
they for in solivan county in case I'm
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I I don't know we
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
can get you we can get you that
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
information so the way these grants
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
typically work um so we do not budget
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
for these in the 10year plan so unless
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
we receive a grant then we'll put it in
 
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
the 10year plan so we do not budget for
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
receiving grants until we actually get
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
them okay U because we have no idea um
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
how successful will'll be so okay um and
 
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
I just put we put a note in there that
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
um 30 36% of the iig funding or $900
 
00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:40.519 align:start position:0%
billion um is a is under discretionary
 
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
grants um and that's just the Federal
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
Highway portion there's a small portion
 
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
of grants that are available through FDA
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
FAA F Etc so that's just the Federal
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
Highway portion on on page five is
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
a uh yes go ahead please representive
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
alone thank you Mr chairman um so on all
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
the discretionary
 
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
grants this is just a listing of what's
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
available correct correct follow up okay
 
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
please continue
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
so do you track how many of these grants
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
have been applied for by communities in
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
the states I mean are you keeping a list
 
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:19.240 align:start position:0%
of what's I mean how do we how do we
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
know how much money of this of from all
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
these programs is coming into New
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I guess basically that's much
 
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
so we'll go to the next next page so um
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
one thing I would say is this is not a
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
complete list list this is just a list
 
00:10:34.269 --> 00:10:34.279 align:start position:0%
of the grants that are available to New
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire typically there are other
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
grants that are available for like
 
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:43.839 align:start position:0%
tunnels um fairies um uh Native American
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
populations so there's also very
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
specified grants that that New Hampshire
 
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:52.519 align:start position:0%
either doesn't qualify for or or
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a purpose to apply for so
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
we just listed the ones there are much
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
more um so on page five is is the L
 
00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
listing of discretionary grants that we
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
know um we've we've we've received as a
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
state so when you see like the very
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
first one Safe Streets for all um as I
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
said those are either Community or
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
Mo um Municipal planning organizations
 
00:11:17.959 --> 00:11:18.670 align:start position:0%
Mo um Municipal planning organizations
the

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
RPC those the only folks that can apply
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
the state can't so all of these were
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
applied for by a
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
community um and were received you'll
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
notice the words at the top that a
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
direct recipient right next to Safe
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
roots to school that means that those
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
communities or that that applicant
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
receives the money directly from Federal
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
Highway we are not involved so why I
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
don't know what roads in Sullivan County
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have anything to do
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
with the application we we haven't been
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
involved we can get that information
 
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
okay um but when you see direct
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
recipient that means the money goes
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
directly to the communities from Federal
 
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
Highway and the do isn't involved in
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
tracking those all right great thank you
 
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
for that clarification ification yes
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
represent Mills please so in this in
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
this instance when the when we've got
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
the direct recipients and they get this
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
money for this project city of Keane
 
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
$350,000 that goes direct to them will
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
that project ever show up in the 10-year
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
plan or is it up to them to build it or
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
is it up to them to contact you to say
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
we need this done we've got the money
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay for it how does that
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
work no the the town is the town would
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
either hire hire someone to design the
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
um and and put it out to bid and have it
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
built we wouldn't we wouldn't typically
 
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
be involved and they would they wouldn't
 
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
ask for our assistance okay that that's
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
just for the direct recipient cor I
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
suppose the other ones are going to be
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions no doubt correct so you'll
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
see in the middle of the page the
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
general Sullivan Bridge okay we received
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
a a $20 million raise Grant um so that
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
is our project that money came to us and
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
that would show in the 10-year plan is
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
under the funding's $20 million of of
 
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.949 align:start position:0%
under the funding's $20 million of of
raise

00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
raise
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
Grant and that's the same for Hinsdale
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
Brattleboro and the leban and Harford
 
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
project so the last three on the page
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
are our state DOT projects where we
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
received the funds we applied we
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
received the funds and we would without
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
showing the 10-year
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
plan on page six um there's another uh a
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
do project which is aquatic organism
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
passage uh another grant that the city
 
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
of do applied for and received direct
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
recipient all the rest are congressional
 
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
directed spending funds
 
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
so these are uh Congressional um
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
delegation applied for put in for these
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
communities and these were received
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
these are LPA projects so we will manage
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
these to some degree we'll we'll we will
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
pass through the funding either the
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
community will manage it or we
 
00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
will um so you'll see the a total Grant
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
Awards currently 980 million or sorry
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's one too many zeros in there n98
 
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.160 align:start position:0%
million um has been awarded uh
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
currently on page seven
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing list that we keep of
 
00:14:36.189 --> 00:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
grants that the dot has applied for um
 
00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:39.079 align:start position:0%
these are iiga
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
grants um they're they're split out into
 
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:44.680 align:start position:0%
the the first two are grants that were
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
awarded so we applied for these grants
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
we received
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
um uh funds for those grants and so you
 
00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:55.399 align:start position:0%
see what the project cost is what the
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
grant amount requested was the date we
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
received uh
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
a positive uh Award of the Grant and
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
then how much we received the middle are
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
grants that we've applied
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
for um that are pending outcome so we
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
don't know whether we've received the
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
grants or not and then at the bottom the
 
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
last three were grants that we applied
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
for that we were unsuccessful and did
 
00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:20.269 align:start position:0%
for that we were unsuccessful and did
not

00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
receive so this is an ongoing list
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
changes it sort of gives you a flavor of
 
00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
the different Grant types that uh We've
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
applied for
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh for different project types as well
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
so we actively look uh for grants that
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
are available projects that we could
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
apply for that that meet the criteria
 
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
and are actively um looking to apply for
 
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.670 align:start position:0%
and are actively um looking to apply for
these

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
grants right thank you please continue
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
see any questions
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
questions so the the next question on
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
page eight um dealt with historic p
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
so this was a a request of how many
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
miles have we historically paved
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
um and this is a a chart that goes back
 
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.590 align:start position:0%
um and this is a a chart that goes back
to

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
1992 so you'll see that in the 2000s uh
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
the paving um went down
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
considerably in
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
200 10ish you'll see we paved 700 miles
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
that was an ARA Spike American Recovery
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll forget the other our act so
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
federal government gave us lots of money
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
we used it to pave the roads and bring
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
the conditions
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
up that's why there was that spike it
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
was really a one onetime
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
um uh effort um and
 
00:16:50.189 --> 00:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
funding then you'll see um the
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
next in the next couple years it goes
 
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
back to you know the prear era of of
 
00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
about 300 miles a year and then there's
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
a spike again in
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
2014 and that is directly related to S
 
00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:05.829 align:start position:0%
2014 and that is directly related to S
SP

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
SP
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
367 um and that influx of funds uh to be
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
able to pave roads so that roughly say
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
$20 million um that was directly related
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
to our ability to pave more than 500
 
00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:23.079 align:start position:0%
Miles um there's a a little dip in
 
00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.590 align:start position:0%
Miles um there's a a little dip in
20120

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
20120
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
21 um directly related to
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
covid and and um I contractors not not
 
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.510 align:start position:0%
covid and and um I contractors not not
pay

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
Mees um and then you'll see where we are
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
currently so that you know from
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
2014 uh to date um the being able to pay
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
over 400 miles a year directly related
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
to the S SP 367
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
funds uh uh yes uh okay yes we have a
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
question ref on Boger
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
please um based on your chart here in 20
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
22 where you had a dip um of that and if
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
we had the same amount of money coming
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
from that uh other bill that SB Bill uh
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
did we save that money to move it
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
forward or what did we do with that
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
money yeah I I think what you see is the
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
the the 300
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
and 37 it's tough getting old 33 337 I
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
should have put these on earlier hey
 
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.510 align:start position:0%
should have put these on earlier hey
it's

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
um what you see is the there's probably
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
100 miles in there we didn't pave we
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
paved it the next year that's why 515 is
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
a little higher than the rest so um the
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
reality is is that the paving we didn't
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
do in 21 we we did in
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
22 oh yes fall please continue rest the
 
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
money that was not
 
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
spent because you said usually there's
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
enough money from that bill to pay 500
 
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
and if we're Paving 300 add a couple
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars a mile does that yeah so
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
so we we
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
didn't we used the money we just used it
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
the next year so the difference the the
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
337 we we probably we didn't pave um
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
mainly either the construction Crews
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
weren't working because of covid or
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't work because of covid so that
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't PVE the full call it you know
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
450 miles we pave 337 so the the the
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
projects that we didn't pave in
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
22 or in 21 we paved in 23 so that's why
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
we have 500 miles in 20 uh
 
00:19:47.149 --> 00:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
2022 we didn't lose money we didn't save
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
money we just use the money the next
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
year all
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
right if I may just to add a little bit
 
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
of color to that we do bring the money
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
forward but what we are seeing as prices
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
increase we are Paving fewer and fewer
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
miles so there's two dynamics that that
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
are impacting us one we saved the money
 
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.870 align:start position:0%
are impacting us one we saved the money
from

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
2021 because of covid and then as we put
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
that money back to work we're not
 
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
getting quite as many miles out of it
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
because the costs are are going up as
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that that makes a lot
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
more sense thank you thank you and
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
that's why you see the decrease from 500
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
miles down to where we are currently at
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
450 or so okay thank you representative
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
Boyd please thank you Mr chairman I know
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
you probably have said this my mind is
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
failing me right now how many how many
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
linear miles of Road are on by the
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
state we
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
have 40 4600 miles of state
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
roads follow Mr chair uh yes please
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
continue thank
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
you in looking at the historic Paving
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
over the last 32 years just appears to
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
me to be very
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
chaotic and having come from a municipal
 
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.789 align:start position:0%
chaotic and having come from a municipal
background

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
where we've planned and graded our roads
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
so that we're able to analyze and figure
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
out what road gets paved next does the
 
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
dot employ a planning methodology that
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
gives the 4600 miles of Roads specific
 
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
grades and therefore prepares its roads
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
for when it needs to be repaved based on
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
the grade just curious curious to know
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
what you meod on absolutely we have a in
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
our materials and research section we
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
have a pavement management section it's
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
made up of a group of people this is all
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
they do every day so they review every
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
section of State Road they they we have
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
uh data machines that go out and measure
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
the runting and the roughness and um and
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
and develop a an index a rating index of
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
the condition of the road and we
 
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:03.799 align:start position:0%
prioritize those that are in foreign in
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
poor shape um develop a a plan for the
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
best um most cost efficient way of uh
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
bringing that road back into shape um
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
and this this group is uh exemplary in
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
in what they do um using the few dollars
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
that they have to bring the roads up and
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
I think the next slide you'll really see
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
the work that they've done over the last
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
top

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay there's another question okay yeah
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes please Contin sorry about
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
it I I saw this I I cheated I I I jumped
 
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:50.919 align:start position:0%
ahead um currently right now going into
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
2024 and I'm not sure what your grading
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
system is but what how many linear miles
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
of Road are graded let's just say C
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
minus are below and what's the cost
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
going to be to bring them back up to a b
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
or a
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
c is it on your slides because I haven't
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
so so on slide nine we basically use a
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
system of good Fair poor and very poor
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay then let me let me retract and
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
rephrase out of the 4600 linear miles
 
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
how many roads how many linear miles of
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
roads are currently classified as either
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
poor or very poor in the
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
state linear miles we're going to do
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to do math do math so so as
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
as he does the math let let me explain
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
what the two charts show on on in
 
00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
2014 uh we basically had
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
33% or a third of those roads were in
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
poor very poor shape now through the
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
efforts of of our pavement management
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
section and you know the funding
 
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
received through
 
00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
s367 um we're down to 14%
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh poor very poor and actually the very
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
poor roads have gone from 7 to 1%
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
so if if I may there that leaves about
 
00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
644 miles but if if I could I would like
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
to take your point in totality
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd you you made the
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
observation that the mileage we pave is
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat chaotic so the mileage we pave
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
is a direct function of the funding that
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
we have and I understand that understand
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
that if if I can as funding increased in
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
2014 we've been able to to be somewhat
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
um consistent we are seeing that mileage
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
tailing off now and that mileage is TA
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
tailing off because the funding has
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
remained somewhat consistent but the
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
price has gone up I want to explain this
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
thoroughly because the bottom line when
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
it comes to funding we are facing as B
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
367 going away as we've explained so
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
we're out we're about to face one of
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
those those more chaotic um lines in
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
this graph where in 26 we won't be
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
Paving as many miles um because of that
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
loss of SB
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
367 what the Department's committed to
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
is to try to flex our our federal funds
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we can to keep our
 
00:25:27.909 --> 00:25:27.919 align:start position:0%
payment and in good conditions but those
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
Federal funds are also committed to the
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
projects in the in the 10-year plan so
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
um we are again facing in the near
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
future loss of funding that will impact
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
our asset condition and our payment
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
condition so if if I if I
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
may one of the other things is the the
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
graphs the charts on the wall so the the
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
the chart on your left is the pavement
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
condition uh in tiers one and two and
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
then the the middle chart the the one on
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
the right there is pavement conditions
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
on tier three and four and you'll see
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
the color coding is the same so a little
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
bit deeper dive into the roads that we
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
see that are are say in very poor shape
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
the the green the all green gra uh bar
 
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
graph on the far left are the tier one
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
rows the interstates those are all in in
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
good or Fair shape there are no very
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
poor poor roads on the interstate system
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
and we dedicate funds to keep it that
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
way so the second graph of the tier 2
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
roads those are the route 16s the route
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
9s those major uh Statewide corridors um
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
that are high volume roads that we need
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
to keep in uh in good shape and you'll
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
see that very little of those are in in
 
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
poor shape um then when you get over
 
00:26:54.909 --> 00:26:54.919 align:start position:0%
into the tier three and four roads
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the the poor and the
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
very poor increase and it's the tier
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
four roads the the bar graph on the
 
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
far right that have the the highest
 
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
those are those those unnumbered State
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
routes that a lot of people would say is
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
this really a state route those are the
 
00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
ones that don't have a high traffic
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
volume that tend to be more
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
community-based roads that we don't we
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of resources for and
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
most of those
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
roads I I will say are not federally
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
eligible and we talked about that last
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
time that 11 100 miles of the 4600
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
aren't federally eligible so the only
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
funds we you can use are State funds so
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
that's SP 367 and that that used to be a
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
huge number of poor and very poor roads
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
because we had no funds to really pave
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
those roads in
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
2014 so now we've been able to invest
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
that s SP 367 funds in those roads that
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
aren't F federally eligible so you you
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
see that those tier three and four roads
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
those Community Based roads are the ones
 
00:28:03.509 --> 00:28:03.519 align:start position:0%
that were affected the most uh by that
 
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
that funding so
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully thank you Mr chairman
 
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.870 align:start position:0%
hopefully thank you Mr chairman
represent

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
sorry would you say that the uh 14% of
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
the roads that are poor and very poor
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
will consume a larger portion of that
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
that budgeted money because they're in
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
worse shape than if you were repairing
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
like the
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
31% uh which is in the fair condition
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that not typically I mean
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
we review each Road for for what pavment
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
treatment it is on a tier three or four
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
Road the typical treatment is either an
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
overlay um we may Mill out some of the
 
00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:54.440 align:start position:0%
the the ruts or we may um may fill in
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
and and do what we call a drag shim we
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
would we would fill in with pavement
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
those ruts to smooth the road out and
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
then overlay it we have lowcost ways to
 
00:29:05.149 --> 00:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
improve the roads and bring them out of
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
the very poor condition they are what
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
you tend to see is the more costly
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
improvements are those that are done on
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
the interstate or on those tier 2 roads
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
where we actually have to Mill out the
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
road because the the mill out the top
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
courses of Road Road bed because they're
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're failing um runting
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
Beyond savings so an overlay isn't going
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
to fix it and it's basically deals with
 
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
the high volume of traffic the high
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
heavy truck loads that we see on them
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know continually uh degrades the
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
pavement so you see those a lot more uh
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
more costly improvements on those bigger
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
roads but there's less miles of those
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
done each year so back representative
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
voy thank you Mr chairman duve tailing
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
off of Representative bogur because he
 
00:29:57.789 --> 00:29:57.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking your question I
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
appre appreciate that you you talk about
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
how some of these are community
 
00:30:04.389 --> 00:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
community based roads and the folks that
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
live in these communities have have a
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
right to drive a road without losing a
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
filling so and I don't mean to sound
 
00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
crass I mean it's one thing to put patch
 
00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:14.519 align:start position:0%
into the road it's another thing that
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
actually if we own if if the state owns
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
the road then that there should be a
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
specific level of care that's given to
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
that particular road so that people can
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
can use it to be able to get from point
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
point A to point B I mean I get the
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
funding piece because I wanted to rip up
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
my driveway in 2019 and it was going to
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
be 18 I went to look at it last year and
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
it is now 30 just to rip up my my
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
quarter mile driveway where I live in
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
Marram 18 to 30 within the span of a
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
couple of years so yes prices are going
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
up so the question I would ask is that
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
if prices are going up how how come a
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
request for an additional influx of
 
00:30:58.269 --> 00:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
capital to to to rebuild these roads is
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
isn't being requested I think it's I
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
mean I sat on the Town Council for 10
 
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
years and I had DPW tell me it's going
 
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:07.480 align:start position:0%
to cost me this to do the roads we gave
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
it to them not not that I'm Cavalier
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
with the taxpayer at Dollar I'm just
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
saying that there's there's a there's
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
there's a price to to maintain these
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
roads so I'm just curious to know if
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's a plan to be asking for more
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
funding in the near future to to tackle
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
these these 1100 miles that aren't
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
eligible for f Federal funding
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that that question
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what we are are doing
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
here having this this discussion so the
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
department does not necessarily take the
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
position of coming to house Public Works
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
and telling you we need more money and
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
we need you to provide us money what we
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
are here telling you is what we can do
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
with the funds that that we have and we
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
we trust you to recognize if if you
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
think we we need more funds and to work
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
with us through discussions to to help
 
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
to to get that um so I appreciate the
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
the question and the discussion and if
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
house Public Works wants to have a
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
bigger discussion about Revenue I think
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
the the department could is is in a
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
position to to have that discussion I
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
would like to make one more distinction
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
about the paving if if that's okay um
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to these tier
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
four roads which are our low volume
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
volume roads the condition of those
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
roads is very very important to us and
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
our current pavement strategy has us
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
providing what we call a maintenance
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
pave so to your question of is it more
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
expensive to rehabilitate those those
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
tier four roads if we were to
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
reconstruct those roads to the level
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
they need to be because many of them
 
00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
have not been formally constructed we
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
would be talking about cost of a million
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
a half to maybe $2 million a mile for
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
some of those roads with our strategy of
 
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
Maintenance Paving we can treat those
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
roads on a regular cycle for 50 to
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
75,000 per per mile with with the
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
resources that we have and being good
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
stewards of the the taxpayer resources
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
as much as we the department would like
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
to reconstruct that that 800 plus miles
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
of of road we think right now and we
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
think our data proves it the best way to
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
keep those roads in good condition is to
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
continue to do this maintenance Paving
 
00:33:48.629 --> 00:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
we continue to identify through our
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
districts the very worst of those roads
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
in do some more more deeper
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
reconstruction that we'd like to that
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to do and as necessary
 
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
but we do think we have a good balance
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
of the maintenance Paving versus the the
 
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.110 align:start position:0%
of the maintenance Paving versus the the
deeper

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
deeper
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
reconstruction thank you uh represent
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
Pon peon
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
bone Bon I'm sorry I have two spots on
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
these desks that I constantly pulled the
 
00:34:20.589 --> 00:34:20.599 align:start position:0%
wrong way I apologize no problem
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
represent alone thank you Mr
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
chairman okay so I'm trying to figure
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
this out so what you're saying is you we
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
have a maintenance
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
plan to take care of these roads $50,000
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
dollars a
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
mile but there's still in very poor
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
condition what would it take to get that
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
number from 1% down to
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
zero that's one question the second
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
question is what would it take to
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
roads I I can I can tell you if we're
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
talking about reconstructing 500 miles
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
of of very poor roads exceed from a
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
million to a million and a half per mile
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost 500 million to 550
 
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.910 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost 500 million to 550
Plus

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
million so I
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
I I think what you what you're seeing is
 
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
with these very poor roads is the the
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and preservation
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
treatment that we do is we we overlay it
 
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
right so typically we we'll put an an
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
inch of pavement on top and it keeps it
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
together we have a pavement cycle of
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
maybe eight eight or 10 years where we
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
come back the problem is those roads
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
hold together for
 
00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.750 align:start position:0%
hold together for
six

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
so they they fall into the very poor
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
shape and then a year or so later we
 
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
shape and then a year or so later we
pave

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
pave
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
them we really can't can't we don't have
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
the funds the ability the contractors to
 
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
pave these roads on a a a better cycle
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
than that I mean the reality is how do
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
we reduce this to zero um that's a
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's a tough one because I think we're
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
always going to have roads that are in
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
poor shape just mainly because we we
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
can't spend enough money pave enough
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
Lanes uh to take them out so this is not
 
00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
the same road every year this is just
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
they move around and as the road
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
degrades and gets towards its cycle
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
it'll fall into the very poor shape it's
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like the roof on your house
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know it's supposed to last 30 years
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
well the last five years of it it's in
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
pretty sh tough shape and you question
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not you should replace it
 
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
well that's that's where we are with
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
some of these roads is you you look at
 
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
them and say and it's it's in tough
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
shape it needs to needs to be fixed um
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
and and then we usually get to it so
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
I I will
 
00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
and so a story back in 2012
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
2014 we were up in the North Country I
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
think in the town of
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
Tamworth up with our district engineer
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
received tons of complaints about a road
 
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
the speed limit was meaningless because
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
you couldn't go more than 10 miles an
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
hour it was it was you know it was free
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
thaw spring mud season and the road was
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
terrible we would get calls all the time
 
00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
about the conditions of the roads we do
 
00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
not get calls about the conditions of
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
the roads anymore people understand that
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to get to them and and the
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
the condition I mean we've gone from a
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
third of our roads in poor shape to to
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
16% 86% of our roads are in good and
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
fair shape to me that's that's a that's
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
a tremendous achievement in in in my my
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
view and you know with the continued
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
funding and with our asset management
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
with our with our crew that goes out and
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
figures out the way to prioritize these
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
roads um we can we can do better um and
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
we can get that number down we think but
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
to get it to zero I'm not
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
sure I'm not sure we could really do
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if it would be
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
economical to be able to do that too
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um so a sidebar to your
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
sidebar where phones aren't ringing that
 
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
much anymore uh my phone rings I was in
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro last night with the selectman
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
and a large group of uh people from town
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
asking me all the same questions these
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
representatives are and I was extremely
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
pleased that the department was able to
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
put me in contact with what our
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
reconstruction and our Paving schedule
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
was going forward for that town
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
extremely appreciate that or I would
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
have been tired and feathered leaving
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
that room what surprised the heck out of
 
00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
me was when they saw that they're on um
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
that some of their roads they have they
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
have three of those and I can't tell you
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
which are tier three and tier four uh
 
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
171 109 and 109a they're horrible
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
anytime a year I drive over them the um
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
but when they saw that uh District 3 had
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
some resurfacing of 171 going out to bid
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
in 24 and they saw that it was at least
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
going to be considered and like the idea
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
of the department starting in sandwich
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
and running all the way to
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
Wakefield and that that in 25 and 26
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
might become a reality they said thank
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
you and and um so they they want to know
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
that they're on a schedule the the
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
biggest problem here is and I've had
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
phone calls from some of my uh favorite
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the Senate is what to
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
do um I believe Senate Bill 367 was was
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
the instrument that uh was tied to the
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
increase in the uh road toll and then uh
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
very creatively people other than us in
 
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
this this room had come up with that
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
schedule of um paying interest versus
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
principal and we ended up with this
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing that everyone started to
 
00:40:31.069 --> 00:40:31.079 align:start position:0%
enjoy at 500 miles and then I was taken
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
back to here that I that we're back to
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
250 when I sat here when that first
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
passed I said you know we have years of
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
funding here and I can't imagine sitting
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
here when that runs out and I'm sitting
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
here when that's running out so I um we
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
were for the members that weren't here
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
when when this committee came out and
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
endorsed that road toll increase at Four
 
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.790 align:start position:0%
endorsed that road toll increase at Four
Cents

00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
Cents
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh there were there were actual wanted
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
posters made and distributed online uh
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
for everyone that that was for that and
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
I think they put a King hat on everyone
 
00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.470 align:start position:0%
I think they put a King hat on everyone
that

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't uh we are we are at a point that
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
we need to be brave once again and I
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's if it's that's the
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle but I was just speaking to uh
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
represent Mills earlier that we do have
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
a commission uh to study uh alternative
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
road toll
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
fees and I I think we need to invite the
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
department I think that's probably the
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
right vehicle to get that conversation
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
going with was with valone's question
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative valone's question on how
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
much money is it really um it it seems
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
like the federal government we keep
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
hearing it's coming it's coming it's
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
coming it's not coming uh we're in
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
election cycle and so forth and next
 
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
year's Finance so it would be the the
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
best time to be doing this but I I would
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
like to invite you know um Department of
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
Transportation into a stronger
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
conversation on what's needed for for
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
Paving and bridges and so forth because
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
we need to be brave about it we need to
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
take it uh repres boy talks about you
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
know in the larger cities well we need
 
00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:22.839 align:start position:0%
this much money we've got to do it you
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
take care of it uh it's something we we
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
can't kick it down the road Road
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
anymore um would you would you believe
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
any of that and would you think I I just
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
lost the commissioner but do you think
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
that we can we can get that going and
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
then work with work with our Senators
 
00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
that are on that same committee is that
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
is that what we need to
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
do we think that that is what we need to
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
do we we think the number is about the
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
20 million do per per year the the
 
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:57.559 align:start position:0%
position the department takes is where
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
those funds come from we we leave to all
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
of you and Mr chairman you your success
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
story from supporting s SP 367 is on
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
page nine of this presentation and we
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
can give you more if if you need that
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
this this really shows the
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
accomplishment of the the sustained
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
investment so um as as a Department of
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
Transportation person
 
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the the the right way
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
to to fund transportation is through the
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
highway fund and and through the the
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
road toll and and I encourage your
 
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
discussions that's that's me what the
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
position we like to to take here with
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
the the the legislature is it's really
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
your decision you you may say well
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
really the general funds has funds right
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
now this is the place to do this so you
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
may be aware of a of another funding
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
source that's where I think we want to
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
be cautious and um work with you to to
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
accept your your ideas um I I do want to
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
say we have just a little bit of of time
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
on this s SP 367 is is going away um
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
this won't change in the in the snap of
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
a finger but it will begin to to change
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
quickly as we PVE less than that um 500
 
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
miles per
 
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
year thank you um further questions
 
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:36.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
my question um when you speak about the
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
higher costs in the last few years for
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
Paving would the cost of asphalt be one
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
of the higher ones yes the the cost of
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
asphalt is definitely a driver the cost
 
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
of Labor is a driver the cost of
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
equipment is a driver when we hear here
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
from from the the contractors they they
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
are very clear that they suffer all the
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
same supply chain issues every other
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
business does all the increased cost for
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
equipment but asphalt is definitely
 
00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
among those and we have a chart in
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
another presentation that's geared
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
towards Paving that shows that increase
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
in and asphalt cement costs and of
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
course as that increases we pay fewer
 
00:45:30.349 --> 00:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
miles follow up yes repres please being
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
that that being the case would you agree
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
that if the United States was increased
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
oil production as we can here and in the
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
free market that would lower the price
 
00:45:44.319 --> 00:45:45.309 align:start position:0%
free market that would lower the price
of

00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:49.069 --> 00:45:49.079 align:start position:0%
oil um would you say that would be a
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
benefit to the paving end of this thing
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
I would say I have an opinion but that's
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
beyond my expertise
 
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner for Department of
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you thank you for
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
the question represent uh representative
 
00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
Jack then I'll come back to board uh
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um there's a huge amount of
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
federal funds in the Ia and a couple of
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
other Federal programs that have made a
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
huge difference in the Red lless Bridge
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
situation also over the last few years
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
and we uh that's it's totally due to
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
that funding source that we've been able
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
I would agree I would agree with with
 
00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
that and that we we we I would also
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
agree that we have more Federal money
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
coming into Transportation now than we
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
we ever have but we also have a 10-year
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
plan with a lot of capital projects and
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
reconstruction projects that are
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
absorbing those those federal funds um
 
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
and this so we still wind up with they
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
loss as we lose sp3 67 there are also
 
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
limitations on those federal funds and
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
what roads they can be spent on and our
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
tier four roads is very limited um if
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
any federal funds that can be applied to
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
those roads so a modest State investment
 
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
is what helps us to take care of those
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
00:47:22.349 --> 00:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
again for taking my
 
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:28.240 align:start position:0%
question if there are
 
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate Mr oldenberg comments
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
regarding zero
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
being unrealistic because I would say
 
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's a circle it's like a circle it
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
keeps going it's never you're never
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
going to hit zero and I and I understand
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that but with with that
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
being said the thing that has struck me
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
is your statement that you don't take a
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
position to ask for more for more money
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
but yet both of you have engineering
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
degrees that put you in an imminent
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
position of being qualified to talk
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
about whether a road is in good shape or
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
in crummy shape so with that being said
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
why has there historically been a
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
reticence by the dot to communicate the
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
road stink and that we need x amount of
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
dollars to get them up to
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
fair if I if I could let me just step in
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
for just a moment and if my questions if
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'm being held in contempt I apologize
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
Mr no no know I uh and I'm trying to
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
decide whether to put you on shoulders
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
and run you around the room they um I
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
weigh 185 they um I I think the
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
department I think you're going to hear
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
the same is we're the policy we're the
 
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
people that should and I I think there's
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
a concern of certain Personnel stepping
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
over their bounds on what they should do
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
with that said please yes and and what I
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
can what I can say is this committee
 
00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
in the legislature solved that problem
 
00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
largely for us in in 2014 with s SP
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
367 so again page nine of this
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
presentation from our perspective is a
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
success story we argue a lot internally
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
about whether we should rebuild every
 
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
one of these poor roads from the bottom
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
up spending a million to a million and a
 
00:49:29.309 --> 00:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
half per mile or spend the 50 to 75,000
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
per mile to put a to put a thin lift of
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
of payment on them that's going to get
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
us seven or eight years what prior to
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
2014 our strategy really had been to try
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
to rebuild from the bottom up a lot of
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
our poor roads to get us out of the the
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
very poor condition what what I've
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
learned as as an engineer through
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
experience over over these past years is
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
that thin lift of pavement every 8 to 10
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
years on these very poor roads really is
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
the lowest life cycle cost to maintain
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
these roads and uh not perfect but I
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
think acceptable acceptable conditions I
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
think if we try to maintain all of our
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
Assets in good condition all the time
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
there's not enough money in the world
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
world just like um Bill had stated
 
00:50:32.789 --> 00:50:32.799 align:start position:0%
earlier when when you think of the the
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
roof on your house right when's the most
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
economical time to change that roof the
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
day before it starts leaking and cost
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
you more if you change it two years
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
earlier five years earlier you've you've
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
taken the economics of that roof and
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
draw draw pushed up the annual cost of
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
it so well and perfect and while we
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
still have some poor and very poor roads
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
um I do think we're getting to a very
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
good cycle the other thing we're doing
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
internally as we pave these roads with
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
our forces we're going out and changing
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
pipes ahead of time we're doing ditching
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh ahead of time trying to get rid of
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
that water that is really the the
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
culprit of all the damage in a most cost
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh effective way so I do think we're
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
making progress and I do think if we
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
keep with this um strategy we are going
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
to drive the the best life cycle of the
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
roads I also think as these tier four
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
roads get a few more of those thinner
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
coats an inch or or a little bit less
 
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to to um perform a little
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
bit better in the long run as well not
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
perfectly but a little bit better rent
 
00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.589 align:start position:0%
perfectly but a little bit better rent
fauler

00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
fauler
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
please so I think I remember when I was
 
00:51:57.789 --> 00:51:57.799 align:start position:0%
a kid
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
we would drive along we would close our
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
eyes when we were approaching the state
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
line with Massachusetts and we'd try to
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
take guesses as to when we cross the
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
state line and you could hear it in the
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
tires because the roads in Massachusetts
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
were so much poorer than were're in New
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think it was a matter of
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
Pride that we had good
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
roads and um and I think people still
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it but the the whole
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%
issue of people's willingness to pay
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
seems to have
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh shifted
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
and you know it's a balance I understand
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
it's a balance and you mentioned $20
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
million as a figure was that just for
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
repaving is you bring it up yes because
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
I sort of doing my own calculations I
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
mean that's the only one place where
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
we're have shortcomings like the fact
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
that we're getting Federal money and not
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
putting up our own dollars to be able to
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
do more with the federal
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
dollars every other program assistance
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
to towns really hasn't gone up either
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
when they their costs are going up um is
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
there a number which would kind of get
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
us back
 
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
to a balance where
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
people would have the
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
same maybe I'm putting on the spot the
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
thing you didn't want to ask for but you
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
know I was estimating the shortfall of
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
being more like $60 million a year and
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you tried to come up
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
with a number that's like
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah to answer that question that
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
the $20 million is just to replace the
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
sp sp
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
367 and continue with our Paving
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
strategy it doesn't include any of the
 
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
other wants that that that people may
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
have or if we were to put together and
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
an overall strategy to improve condition
 
00:53:50.109 --> 00:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
um what that dollar value would be would
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
be to continue the the maintenance
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
Paving that and the preservation Paving
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing at the rates that
 
00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.670 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing at the rates that
we

00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
have thank you please represent thank
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman U when you you mentioned
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
a couple of times rebuilding sections or
 
00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
or possibly rebuilding some tier four
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
maybe tier three roads does that include
 
00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
digging down into the
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
substrate and um going from the you know
 
00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
the very the gravel the the uh Crush Etc
 
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
and then all the way up to what
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
2 in or 4 Ines of pavement and how does
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
that compare to maybe if you know how
 
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
they do it in say in Europe say in
 
00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
Germany do they go down deeper when they
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
are there different um depths to the
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
substrate when you're talking about
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
preparing a road bed that would be more
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
advantageous to us to uh get more
 
00:54:48.990 --> 00:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
longevity out of that particular
 
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
road yeah so we we do have a we do have
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
different crosssections we call them
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
cross sections layers of of sand gravel
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
Crush gravel pavement base and and then
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
pavement that that we try to uh achieve
 
00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
when we're talking you know a million to
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
a million and a half per mile on these
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
tier four roads that's a combination of
 
00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:19.799 align:start position:0%
strategies and that's not building a a
 
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
Cadillac road going down five or six
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
feet that's going down 3 feet and
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
improving the the drainage and and so
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
forth so there are a number of designs
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
there's also some lower cost strategies
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
that we try to use instead of going down
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
deeper we try to use some of our
 
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
recycled materials either by um either
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
by reclaiming the pavement mixing the
 
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
existing pavement with the top select
 
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
materials or adding some Stone in and
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
reclaiming the the pavement or putting
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
some what we call cold plane millings uh
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
you see on the interstates when we grind
 
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
the pavement and haul that material away
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
that material sometimes goes into the
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
new asphalt we also Salvage a portion of
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
that to the dot and we'll put that down
 
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
on a poor Road at a lower cost per mile
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
to help improve it before we overlay it
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
with another pavement so there's a
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
number number of different strategies we
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
use at different costs to make
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
improvements if I could so
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're you hit on totally rebuilding the
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
road taking it down to to subbase just a
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
a sort
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
of history of roads in New Hampshire
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
most of the roads we're talking about
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
are unbuilt roads um we a lot of our
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
roads that still exist today um Route 28
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
through Alton was uh
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
was built in the 20s and the 30s it was
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
part of the was it the New Deal
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
depression yeah it was The Depression
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
get to work and and and spend money to
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
to bring the economy back that was six
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
inches of gravel and they they paved two
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
inches right it was it was to get the
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
Model T on a road there's no drainage
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
there was no nothing that road still
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
exists today so the problem is all we've
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
been able to do is pay
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
over you know LOM we that's because
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
that's what's under the road to to be
 
00:57:35.789 --> 00:57:35.799 align:start position:0%
able to reconstruct those those roads
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the tier three and four
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
roads are like that they're the they're
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
the the the carriage paths you know that
 
00:57:44.190 --> 00:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
people used to run their cattle down to
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
get them to you know to the center of
 
00:57:49.029 --> 00:57:49.039 align:start position:0%
town you know they've over time paved
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
those there's there's no substructure
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
there's no drainage and that that's our
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
problem to be able to build rebuild
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
build these things is is $2 million a
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
mile and um so that I I understand where
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
you're going the cost of rebuilding a
 
00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:09.039 align:start position:0%
road is is huge um and there's just too
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
many miles to be able to do that so um
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
that that's where we get into this is
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
the best most coste effective way of
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
keeping those roads in good
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
shape further questions at this
 
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
point do you want to continue on
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
and um looks like we'll probably we'll
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
probably go to lunch with this okay um
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
and after lunch if we still have
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
continued questions we can certainly
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
handle that in committee otherwise we'll
 
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
start moving into uh some of their recom
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations for amendments and so
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
forth so so I I think we were on page 10
 
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
to sort of go with represent Jack I
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if he was pushing us along or
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
not but red listed Bridges um so I'm the
 
00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
question came up about the Le red listed
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
bridge status either both the state and
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh the top uh graph and
 
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
and narrative go with the state red
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
listed Bridges So currently we have
 
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
about uh 200 or I'm sorry 119 red listed
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
Bridges um we we are putting an
 
00:59:25.109 --> 00:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
additional $156 million over the 10
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
years so about 16 million more um
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
towards red listed
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
Bridges um what we're seeing in so we
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
run prediction models of what and this
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
is this is where it gets a little tough
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
is you never know when a bridge is going
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
to Ender the red list but we we try to
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
put predictions to it um and determine
 
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
when we think it's going to degrade
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
enough certain components enough to get
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
on the red list so we we Rite the deck
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
the substructure which is the steel that
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
holds it up and then the sub the the the
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
sub I'm sorry the deck the super
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
structure which is the steel that holds
 
01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
it up and then the substructure with the
 
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
foundation when those get to a certain
 
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
point really bad it's a 0 to 10 rating
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
four or less puts it on the red list for
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
any of those three um what we are
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
looking at is we we determine how long a
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
bridge stays above the red list and over
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
time it degrades and when it gets on the
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
red list so
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
what we predict is that over the 10-year
 
01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
plan as a bridge comes on we'll we will
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
be able to take a bridge
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
off um so that's why you see a sort of a
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
straight line in reality it's going to
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
go a little you know look like an EKG a
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
little bit but the the idea is over the
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
10-year plan um the the number should
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
stay steady as a bridge goes off the
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
10-year plan another one will be added
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
um so we we're predicting about 118 at
 
01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
the the end of the 10-year plan so about
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
the same number as we have today so we
 
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
have enough funding you know to keep our
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
heads above water um we actually have
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
more funding to be able to do Bridges uh
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
than we do roads um so that it's a good
 
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
thing so we we we can keep the the state
 
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh Bridges um maintained and and in good
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
shape um from a municipal red list so we
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
there were 214 bridges on the municipal
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
Red List uh 43 of those were in a DOT
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
funded um program to to be either
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
repaired or
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
replaced um and at the last presentation
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
we talked about the additional Federal
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
money um that could be used on Municipal
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
owned Bridges this is sort of a first of
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
its kind be able to use federal money on
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
a community-owned
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
bridge so we were able to fund 56 more
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
Bridges Community you know Municipal
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
Bridges um you know using Federal money
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
um through the program so we we have
 
01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
almost a hundred uh Bridges Municipal
 
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
bridges that will be either re rehabed
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
or replaced in the program so we predict
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
that um that number will go down on the
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
municipal side the problem is we don't
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
have the same prediction models with the
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
municipal Bridges uh while we do inspect
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
the municipal Bridges a a lot of
 
01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
communities don't have a budget to
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
repair um maintain preserve Bridges it's
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
we wait until it gets on the red list
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
and we do something about it so it's
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's a hard judge of um you know
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
how you know how long a bridge uh will
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
on a municipal side will last before it
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
becomes red listed so um right now we
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
think the municipal side is is in better
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
shape um I will say on the state side
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
not only do we have federal funds to uh
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
to get Bridges off the red list our
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
Bridge maintainers um
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
which use use State money uh go out and
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
remove bridges you know a dozen or so
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
Bridges from the Red List each year
 
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
through maintenance activities um that
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
they have the capability of we have the
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
capability of doing
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
ourselves um
 
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
so any questions on red list if
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe uh maybe you've already
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
provided could you provide the committee
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh with a list of those bridges that are
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
on that list you don't have to you know
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's broken up by town but could you
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
just send us that
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
list we we have that list I thought we
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
may have supplied it the last meeting
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
but I I'm I'm not sure we will a PDF
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
would be fine if you could send it I've
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
been in and out of here so I apologize
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
go ahead um so on page 11 we talk the
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
question came out about public
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
involvement how we involve um uh the
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
public in our decision making and and
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
and Alternatives uh especially with our
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
roadway projects so on page 11 we we
 
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
this is sort of the the steps involved
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
in a highway project we go from data
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
collection through alternative analysis
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
um you know pref you know selecting that
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
preferred alternative uh if we need
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
formal public hearing we we do that
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
um finalizing the environmental
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
documents associated with that uh
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
preferred alternative so we can get
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
permitting uh developing the
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
construction plans once we have that
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
alternative we can go into final design
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
and and develop those plans and then
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
that then finally constructing um the
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
the project so those are the steps in
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
the project on page 12 we sort of
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
outline uh how we we we involve the
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
public in this decision
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
making um I I will say as a as an
 
01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
overall view on a standard project The
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
public's involved the whole way through
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
uh but public involvement is project uh
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
dependent uh a Paving project we talk
 
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
about Paving a lot we don't have a lot
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
of public involvement in Paving right
 
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of impact um we let
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
the communities know that we're going to
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
pave their road we don't have public
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
meetings typically we put out a public
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
notice um there's not a lot of public
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
involvement that goes into a project
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
like that on a typical project though we
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
do um have public involvement you could
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
picture this is a a a bridge uh you know
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
Bridge Project where we're going to
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
either rehab or replace a bridge or a
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
roadway project you know typically on a
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
a project like that uh the the public
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
involvement is tailored uh to the
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
project a lot of times after we collect
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
the data after we go out and do survey
 
01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
data collection you know count cars uh
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know deir some of the base
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
environmental information we have what
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
we call a blank sheet meeting we'll go
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
out to the public officials and say we
 
01:06:08.349 --> 01:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
have this project we're going to replace
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
this bridge or fix this road what can
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
you tell us that is important to you
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
what do you think um uh you know the
 
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
community is looking for uh for an
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
answer or solution what do you deem as
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
important to this you know make this
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
project successful it's our way of you
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
know one is portraying that there's a
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
project coming we want their input we we
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
take their input so that we're not just
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
starting you know gung-ho without any
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
information we want the community's
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
input in in what the project should
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
entail we see that a lot with roads we
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
talk about sidewalks and shoulders you
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
know turning Lanes uh you know things
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
like that for a bridge it might be you
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
know if it's a historic Bridge you know
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
is the look need to stay the same or can
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
we close the bridge is there a thought
 
01:07:02.269 --> 01:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
about closing the bridge so we can do
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
this faster um are there D2 routs you
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
know emergency access things like that
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
those are the things we want to know
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
upfront before we start going in the
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
wrong direction a lot of
 
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
projects that
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
are you know immensely important to the
 
01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
community we have stakeholder groups or
 
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
public advisory committees so these p s
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
or state holder groups these are groups
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
of you know 15 20 Community folks that
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
lead the discussion uh in the direction
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
that we take so they offer immense input
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
these are you know select board members
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
you know City counselors uh you know all
 
01:07:45.549 --> 01:07:45.559 align:start position:0%
the way down to you know citizens at
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
large that are involved um in in what
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
the the scope of this project would look
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
like when we do the alternative studies
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
on a project we will have a public
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
officials meeting this is these are the
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that we've you know we've
 
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
developed um you know your thoughts as
 
01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
the you know the governing body of the
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
Town um we also would then follow up
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
with a public informational meeting
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
where we invite the public and the
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
abutters to a a meeting to talk about
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
and get their input on on what
 
01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
alternatives they like or want to see
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
you know the pluses and minuses
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes depending on the size of the
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
project we combine those meetings into
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
one ultimately we use that input um in
 
01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
developing a preferred alternative once
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
we we have that preferred alternative we
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
then would typically go back have
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
another public informational meeting
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
saying this is the project now this is
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
what it's going to look like these are
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
the details and uh gather input again uh
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
if needed that we had to acquire
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
property we would have a formal public
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
hearing for us that's uh you know public
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
hearing is is gives us the right of
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
domain you know we don't like using
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
eminent domain we do on occasion have to
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh but the public hearing gives us that
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
right and that lays out in great detail
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
the property the details of the or the
 
01:09:10.110 --> 01:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
project the the details of the project
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
and that input um what what I will say
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
is and I I know where this this this
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
came from this these questions is we try
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
to involve the public
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
um in depth throughout the process
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes it doesn't work sometimes we
 
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
can't reach consensus on the on the
 
01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.470 align:start position:0%
can't reach consensus on the on the
preferred

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
preferred
 
01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
alternative um so we see two things is
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know two issues that we have time
 
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
and not being able to reach
 
01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
consensus the time issue is public
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
officials and public opinion changes we
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
start a project One Way public officials
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
change say I don't like that we seene
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
where people run for office in their
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
town to oppose one of our projects
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's not uncommon so um you know and
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
that so that time tends to be a killer
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
when when we see that and the other is
 
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
um where we can't reach
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
consensus on a on a on a project um we
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
we can't make everybody happy and the
 
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
sort of a fact of life um but it's it's
 
01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:24.110 align:start position:0%
sort of a fact of life um but it's it's
where

01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
we where where where folks can't say
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that I recognize this is the best
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
solution I don't really like it but I
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
accept it and um you know we've seen a
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
couple of those um you know last year
 
01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
the Conway project Do's proposal Town
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
supported it majority of the public
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
supported it but there were property
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
owners that didn't support it so they
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
tried to change the solution through
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
legislation and and we know the outcome
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
and just a few weeks ago here was was
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
the town of Salem was here trying to
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
change um actually a design of of their
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
own project um and trying to legislate
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
change that way so um I know the example
 
01:11:15.790 --> 01:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
that came up was wolfboro project um
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
that project has a 20year history with
 
01:11:22.590 --> 01:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
us 20 years ago we were out and they
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
didn't like the solution so we went home
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
they've brought this project to us
 
01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
through the 10-year plan um they had an
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
idea of the solution they had a plan a
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
master plan we've tried to incorporate
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
those components we have a majority of
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
of of acceptance and consensus on what
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
the road is it's a couple of the
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
intersections um the idea was thrown out
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
a roundabout versus different things um
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
the in the long run the roundabout one
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
that wasn't by consensus that was sort
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
of a majority rule type of type of
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
approach and you know I think now we
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
seen the the folks that don't like the
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
roundabouts are are are coming out and I
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
think that's some of the the feedback
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
that we got so we try our hiest artist
 
01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
to involve the public um so we don't end
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
up in this situation but that's that the
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
reality is is we can't make everybody
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
happy um even though we try so that's I
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
just I just want to say that group pboro
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
again rang my bell so there there
 
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
apparently is a different phone number
 
01:12:33.629 --> 01:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
that's being called now but I I I I had
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
missed I had missed the conversation
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
other day and just that synopsis of what
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
you just said was extremely helpful to
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
me thank you I'm not to belabor the
 
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
wolfboro issue but we had a public
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
involvement plan that involved a a pack
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
20 people from the community were
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
involved in the decision making that
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
that group met
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
over five times over the last three
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
years to make decisions on what the
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
project is we had two public
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
informational meetings we've had surveys
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh multimedia surveys where people could
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
offer their
 
01:13:07.629 --> 01:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
input I don't know I don't know how much
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
more we involve the public in some of
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
this decision making especially in
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
Project like that so
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
um on page 13 and 14 question came up
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
about uh Boston Express the ridership um
 
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
and and the subsidy involved in in the
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
Boston Express so um on page 13 is a
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
slide of um the ridership from
 
01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:36.679 align:start position:0%
2017 uh to
 
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
2023 you'll see the the ridership uh
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
before covid uh was fairly high it's
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
dropped off over Co and slowly picking
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
up but we see that it is picking up um
 
01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
in in ridership and the subsequent slide
 
01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:52.990 align:start position:0%
in in ridership and the subsequent slide
on

01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
14 and it it sort of goes hand hand in
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
hand um the less ridership the more of
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
the subsidy that you see um so you see
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
that subsidy had gone up as ridership
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
went down uh during the covid years but
 
01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's slowly the subsidy is going down as
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
ridership picks up we envision that the
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
ridership will continue uh to to pick up
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully getting back to prepandemic
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
levels uh sooner than
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
later I don't know if there's any more
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
questions about the Boston Express
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
all right um the next was the questions
 
01:14:31.629 --> 01:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
about the capital Corridor project uh
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
question was really how much money did
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
we spent how much is left and and what
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
would it take to to continue that
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
project to completion getting the new
 
01:14:43.229 --> 01:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
starts Grant application in uh so on the
 
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
on the project itself it was uh $5.4
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
million of FTA funds um to uh do the the
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
do that project um the core components
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
were were completed but it didn't
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
totally complete that project before it
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
was halted uh we spent $4.6 million on
 
01:15:10.910 --> 01:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
that project the remaining so the uh
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
question was how much money is remaining
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
it was about 861 million or I'm sorry
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
$861,000 of grant funding left um that
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
money was
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
distributed uh to NASA city of NASA for
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
their transit system and Manchester
 
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
Transit Authority for FDA eligible
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
activity so that
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
$861,000 was distributed uh through
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
other FDA means so there is no money
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
remaining in that Grant um the
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
additional work to take that project to
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
completion and get a new start Grant
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
application would be approximately that
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
$861,000 that was the goal of that
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
project uh
 
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
originally I would say with inflation
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
you're probably talking more in the
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
million dollar range and and that uh to
 
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
pick that up and finish it so that was
 
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
um hopefully answers the capital
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
Corridor questions thank you um on page
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
16 we received some questions about the
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
the the the gas tax the road chol uh and
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
where it went so we wanted to provide
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
this information gives you an idea of um
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
the the 22.2 Cent gas tax where where
 
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
that funding is distributed um as I
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
think the commissioner uh testified last
 
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
time about 60% comes to the dot 40% goes
 
01:16:39.149 --> 01:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
to others like the department of safety
 
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
that's listed here
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
um the it so the the cents
 
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
are we have exact to the tenth of a
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
scent where this money goes and that's
 
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
not really the case this is sort of a
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
snapshot some of those f I'll use block
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
Grand Aid is distributed by percentage
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
of Revenue um
 
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
so s SP
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
367 uh is a component of this so Number
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
Four The Debt Service and State Bridge
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
Aid 3.7 cents that is directly
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
s367 but 12% of s SP 367 also goes to
 
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
block Grand Aid which is number two so
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
whereas I'd love to say 0.5 cents goes
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
to Black Grand Aid that necess
 
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily isn't the case each year
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
it's it could fluctuate because it's a
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
percentage but this sort of gives you a
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the road toll where where
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
it goes um because I think the confusing
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
part was in our Slide the 10-year plan
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
three cents is betterment and 4.2 cents
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
is sp 367 and that's the state funds
 
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
that come out of there that's directly
 
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
goes into the 10-year
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
plan questions yes represent boy I know
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
I'm in my second term but this is kind
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
of a newbie question I apologize what
 
01:18:01.229 --> 01:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
percentage of the operating cost to the
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
fund I don't know the operating cost for
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety correct and how
 
01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
that breaks down the
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.149 --> 01:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
40% that didn't full question oh the
 
01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
percent of the operating cost that goes
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Safety so the 12.9
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
cents and what and what is it used
 
01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
for what is it used for Department of
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
Safety uh generally uh uh Troopers okay
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
Y and I think uh it's uh the cost of
 
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
collections th throws it in there but uh
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm working off memory we do have a
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
detailed chart that that that breaks it
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
down and and pass for years but um
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
um roughly it's 60% that of of that 12.9
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
of the unrestricted Revenue goes to
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
Department transportation operating cost
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
um it's a little more than 30% I think
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
that goes to Department of Safety and
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
then other agencies um divy up the rest
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
some some go to the courts some go to uh
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
some other agencies that have roadway
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions if if if I could
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
take you commissioner back to your lowly
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
days of being a bridge engineer I
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
believe when you started in here um
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
there was there was a strong debate on
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
how much money the department of safety
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
many years ago was was taking from the
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
highway fund u u paying for fleets of uh
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
new cars and everything else and um do
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
was Lo was not getting enough revenue or
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
we felt as a policy that they weren't
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so we passed legislation that
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
limited that am I is that am I on the
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
right track there commissioner yes yeah
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
there was the there was some um there
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
there was some restrictions I think the
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
Restriction was roughly around um
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
roughly around 30% was was where it was
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
maxed for Department of Safety but um I
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
I I I know in the past the the
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
legislature has also waved their own
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
rules to make um budgets um balance
 
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you further questions yes
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
please repres simp thank you Mr chairman
 
01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
i' like to can we just briefly go back
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
to slide uh 15 just real quick uh the
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
remaining funds $861,000 for the um
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
Capital CA
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
project I thought we already moved
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
beyond that one just real quick thank
 
01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
study um I I can speak to that um I I I
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
know what what didn't get done in the
 
01:20:55.149 --> 01:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
study was um and and I think I had
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
answered this at the at the at the
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
public hearing the last work session um
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
we completed the financial document we
 
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
completed the draft environmental impact
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
statement um there was um continued
 
01:21:11.790 --> 01:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
coordination with MBTA development of um
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
inter inter agency operating agreements
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
as well as uh completion of a final
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
environmental impact statement and uh
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
development of a um FTA new starts uh
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
Grant application so those were some of
 
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
the major elements that um um that were
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
originally scoped out but um didn't
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't uh follow through to
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
completion thank you you're welcome
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
thank you represent bone you had
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:47.719 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so on the i93
 
01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
debt service at State Bridge a it's 3.7
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
cents of that three .7 cents how much is
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh devoted to The Debt Service and also
 
01:22:03.310 --> 01:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
when does that debt service
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
end there is a chart from the previous
 
01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:12.750 align:start position:0%
end there is a chart from the previous
one

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
um essential essentially all of that
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
goes to The i93 Debt Service
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah the other the other parts in the
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
waterfall um uh that that goes to um uh
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
block grant Aid or state aid Bridge are
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
already um are already taken out so that
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
3.7 cents would go to The i93 Debt
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
Service the full Debt Service kicks in
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
2025 and uh it it's projected to extend
 
01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.350 align:start position:0%
2025 and uh it it's projected to extend
to

01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
2034 rep Jack yeah if you look at page
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
21 of the handout from last time right
 
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh that's where it is The
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
oh yeah and then the what's spent on the
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh Road improvements is in the second to
 
01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:06.830 align:start position:0%
uh Road improvements is in the second to
last

01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
department and um if I could open up um
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
a new discussion May and I apologize I
 
01:23:24.669 --> 01:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
haven't had the time I wished I could
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
have in committee this year
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
turnpikes the um some of the discussion
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
if I remember
 
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
right um there's always been a
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
discussion of how we can or an inability
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
to expand a
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
Turnpike and that we weren't allowed by
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
typically to um if we were to expand at
 
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
Turnpike then to be able to toll that
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
new section of
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
Turnpike my understanding from some of
 
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
the meetings I've been attending over
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
the over the year that there are there
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
are states that are actually being
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
permitted to expand their term
 
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
bikes and they are also then able to
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
toll those new sections of
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
Road um it is has the department heard
 
01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
any to that I um is my question and I'd
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
be happy to provide that information or
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
would it would it possibly be of benefit
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
that I think off off off the off off the
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
cuff Mr chairman uh I I I think it's a
 
01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:47.719 align:start position:0%
choice or or or or a balance
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
um uh I I know in in the in the past we
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
have expanded the turnpike system uh it
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
it came with a cost um I think it was
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
around 10 years or so ago where where
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
the highway fund or where the turnpike
 
01:25:07.229 --> 01:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
actually bought a section of of the
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
turnpike uh let me let me get this
 
01:25:11.790 --> 01:25:11.800 align:start position:0%
straight the turnpike bought a section
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
of I95 from from the highway fund the
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
section that went from the um uh ports
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
MC traffic circle up to the uh piscatqua
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
River Bridge uh that had been a a
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
highway funded piece of of
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
I95 um it was somewhere in excess of
 
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
$130 million that the turnpike system
 
01:25:37.870 --> 01:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
had had had had bought that from the
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
highway fund and that is now a Turnpike
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
asset we had looked at other proposals
 
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
in the past as part of the bo conquered
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
um uh project to look at extending the
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
turnpike system right now the turnpike
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
ends at Exit 14
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
right right here down here at the bottom
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the hill in conquered we had looked
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
at considering expanding the turnpike
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
system up to uh the maram river so that
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
393 and that full length of Bo conquered
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
could be um Incorporated within within
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
the turnpike and with that proposal
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
would have come a uh you know a
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
systemwide toll increase to to fund that
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh acquisition uh so
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I think some of those tweaks and
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
stuff to to to answer the first party
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
question those things can be considered
 
01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
and and looked at we have had some
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
experience with expanding the turnpike
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
system but it does come at a cost and a
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
willingness to uh you know consider
 
01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
increasing um uh toll rates to support
 
01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.189 align:start position:0%
increasing um uh toll rates to support
it

01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:44.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
the I believe when we passed our last
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
10year budget or our 10-year plan
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
um the Continental Boulevard it was a
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation of this of the 10year
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
plan to remove that and I believe it it
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
it then
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
later um was pulled from our
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation do do you have any
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
updates uh that you could share on on
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
what that is costing your department to
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
continue the maintenance of that I don't
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
need them now but um in the next day or
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
so I would appreciate that yep I can't
 
01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
remember off the top of my head but you
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
you were right that was a that was a
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation I think in the Senate
 
01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
phase of the 10year plan that that um
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
that change had had come out um and we
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
are continuing to maintain Continental
 
01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
Boulevard um and I don't know if it'll
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
come to house public works but there is
 
01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
there is there are some bills relative
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
to um um uh salt use and and winter
 
01:27:49.149 --> 01:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
maintenance along uh some of that
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
section that that house Public Works may
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
be seeing coming over from the Senate so
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
I'd assume it's not costing us any less
 
01:27:59.629 --> 01:27:59.639 align:start position:0%
to continue to maintain that section of
 
01:28:01.709 --> 01:28:01.719 align:start position:0%
Road that's correct and that would
 
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
that's Revenue that you don't have to
 
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
keep your Turnpike system as as viable
 
01:28:11.229 --> 01:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you the um questions
 
01:28:15.790 --> 01:28:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
on yes please thank you Mr chairman just
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
for clarity so you talk about the
 
01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
turnpike system coming up to Exit 14 is
 
01:28:27.109 --> 01:28:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the Fe Turnpike yes is it this the
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
signage on the um at least as you go
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
north doesn't quite depict that I think
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
293 just circum Manchester so it so it
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
goes all the way up to here up to up to
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
Exit 14 yes yeah it's probably kind of a
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
Nuance most people driving it driving
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
through the tolls through through hooks
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
it you're on i93 but um everything thing
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
from Exit 14 um South um through the
 
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
hooks of tolls that's one of the reasons
 
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.320 align:start position:0%
we can we can toll I 93 there is because
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
it is part of the turnpike system so
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the fever Turnpike actually
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
predates the interstate system um it
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
originally ran from the mass line in in
 
01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:20.199 align:start position:0%
nashwa up to up to the um up to what was
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
a a traffic circle at the end of the F
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
fep Turn Pike here
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
conquered thank you you're
 
01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
welcome I I have another and this this
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
would be our time if there's extraneous
 
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh for the Department because
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to afternoon uh we're going
 
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
to start moving into amendments and so
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
forth um I I had the opportunity to
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
attend a u I think it was executive
 
01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
counselor's snowmobile ride a few days
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
ago and while I wasn't able to uh to
 
01:29:59.790 --> 01:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
ride U I had conversations with u the
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
different department Department of
 
01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
Safety and and rails and everyone else
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
was there and um we have a bill that we
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
passed through committee which was
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the Conway
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
Branch um which is Corridor 19 for the
 
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
rail system starting incenter oopy and
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
going into a multimodal trail as a
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh the
 
01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
rails and and I heard something that was
 
01:30:32.350 --> 01:30:32.360 align:start position:0%
stressful to me from uh from that
 
01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
conversation and I followed up with uh
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Stewart and i' I'd like to
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear the commissioner's
 
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
point of you because the the rail
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
division is under your
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
department Trails division which is
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and and other items are
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
under um under
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
um commissioner Stewart's
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
department and we were talking about um
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're sitting there and they were not
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
able to take the ride where they wanted
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
to because the to to ride would have
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
sent them across a section of rail in uh
 
01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:18.280 align:start position:0%
Tamworth and oy that has a lot of
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
switches and other rails and with the
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
lack of snow and melting it becomes
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
unsafe to pass through
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
that and whether and I don't know who
 
01:31:33.310 --> 01:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
owns Which but
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
the in spots like that the rail Divi the
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
trail Division I apologize I'll throw
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
those wrong the trails division
 
01:31:44.669 --> 01:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes has a RightWay which will get
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
them off of the track so they can make
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
connections when we were hearing
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
testimony in here uh um on possibly um
 
01:31:57.199 --> 01:31:58.590 align:start position:0%
testimony in here uh um on possibly um
removing

01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
removing
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
rails and uh loose ties up above and
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
creating a flat surface in that section
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
10 Mile section from OS to Silver Lake
 
01:32:11.790 --> 01:32:11.800 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
um the uh the provider uh North Coast
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
rail North Coast railroad had mentioned
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh they have um they're in the process
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
of pulling rails and ties for their
 
01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
section and they were sharing some
 
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
numbers of what that cost would be to
 
01:32:31.470 --> 01:32:31.480 align:start position:0%
bring the rails that are un that are not
 
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
functional now to an operational level
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
and it's it's worse than our number that
 
01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a million dollars a
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
mile U to re to recreate
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah they but what what I heard was
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
that in some sections up north where the
 
01:32:56.109 --> 01:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
where the um trail trail would normally
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
pull those rails and then would have the
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
ability to share in the revenue of the
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
scrapping of that
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
material because their department is
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
stressed every bit as much as your
 
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
department is I understand there's a new
 
01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.109 align:start position:0%
department is I understand there's a new
policy

01:33:13.109 --> 01:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
now uh from from the Department of
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation that they no longer um do
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit no longer allows us to
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
salvage the steel when pulling rails as
 
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
they like to keep them inhouse for
 
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:32.550 align:start position:0%
they like to keep them inhouse for
future

01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
use old rails old rails that from my
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
understanding in your Department's much
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
more in tune to if we're digging a
 
01:33:44.109 --> 01:33:44.119 align:start position:0%
septic I can tell you what I think you
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
know you know better than me on Rails
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
but we've been told that that 70b rail
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
is or whatever it might be is way
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
insufficient for any new use coming
 
01:33:58.990 --> 01:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
forward so I would I would appreciate it
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
if if you could comment now or if you
 
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
could get back to me uh because if I
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
remember right the state of New
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whether it was your department
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
we we we paid a fee to to take that
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
Corridor in to preserve it and then in
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
the event that rail or Freight or
 
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
passenger was to come back we have to
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
turn turn that back over to whoever now
 
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
owns the
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
railroad so I guess my question is if we
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
have been salvaging some of that or
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we haven't been but it sounded
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
like the department had been salvaging
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
that has something
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
changed because it would it would by
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
eliminating by causing the department
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
Trails not to be able to remove some of
 
01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
that rail is a safety issue and up north
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
it maybe not so much here and
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
and speaker Chandler would chastise me
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
for saying up north because my area is
 
01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
not the North country that's uh but
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
between my area and the Lakes Region and
 
01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
the North
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
Country snowmobile is is a tremendous
 
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
revenue for us and I was excited to hear
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
that hoping at some point with that we
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
can be able to connect to fryberg and
 
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
then our connection just goes everywhere
 
01:35:33.070 --> 01:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering is that a policy by
 
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
your department
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
now um Shelly knows I'm going to call
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
her there sorry I did I did
 
01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
not um with this if you want to let her
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
sit down sorry um I'll put her on on the
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
spot a little bit but I I would say it's
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's a new policy I think
 
01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
we have always look to salvage the the
 
01:35:59.390 --> 01:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
rail that we can and um I think it's you
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
know we we and it's and it's salvaged
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
primarily for maintenance and use on on
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
the other active areas of of uh Trail
 
01:36:10.990 --> 01:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
usage of uh rail usage so um I I
 
01:36:12.189 --> 01:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying with North
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
Coast saying that uh you know they were
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
going to put any um any any um upgraded
 
01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
a new service or or or anything on that
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
that uh the cost to upgrade rail and
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
upgrade those lines is is is quite
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
expensive but um the salvage value that
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
that that we look for the for those
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
rails is to you know go back into the um
 
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
existing areas of active rail line um to
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
help def Fray those maintenance costs uh
 
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
primarily and I I think it's been a
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
common practice I don't think it's a new
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
policy but Shelley I'll let you explain
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
if I could go there I ju I just want to
 
01:36:55.629 --> 01:36:55.639 align:start position:0%
clear up it was this has this has
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the railroad on what
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
they're doing in in in you know they
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
they have a section of line that ends in
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
Osby that's that's that's theirs and
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing those repairs this this
 
01:37:08.830 --> 01:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
conversation has nothing to do with the
 
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
benefit of any rail company sure my
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
and is
 
01:37:19.229 --> 01:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
where we we have
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
um for what purpose is that rail going
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
to be repurposed and have and have we
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
allowed sections to be removed for the
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
the trail division because I would hope
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
they're good stewards with you
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah for the record my name is
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
Shelley Winters I'm the director of
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics Rail and Transit I apologize
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
if I mumble a little bit today um yeah
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
it's been a policy and a practice for
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
probably about 10 plus years that I was
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
in the bureau before I moved to the
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office that any uh
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
railroad lines that were being converted
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
for trails if the rail and the other
 
01:37:58.109 --> 01:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
track material the switches and the
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
plates being pulled out had any
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
salvageable reuse on the active lines we
 
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
require whether the dot manages the
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
project or dncr manages the project that
 
01:38:10.270 --> 01:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
they Salvage those materials and we
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
store them to use on an active line if
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
they're in poor shape if they're too
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
worn out or if it's a lower rail weight
 
01:38:22.109 --> 01:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
than we try to use then we allow dncr or
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
the town whoever that trail sponsor is
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
to salvage those materials and put it
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
towards the cost of their project so
 
01:38:30.109 --> 01:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
it's really specific project by project
 
01:38:31.790 --> 01:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
area by area that we make those
 
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
determinations on whether we Salvage to
 
01:38:37.310 --> 01:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
reuse to the state or whether we allow
 
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
the project sponsor to recoup that
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
salvage value we do not take the
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
components just to get salvage value if
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
it's salvage value selling it to a
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
scrapper dot will not be involved it's
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
only if it saves the state money so we
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
don't have to buy any other rail on an
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.430 --> 01:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
so so if I could do you have and I don't
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
expect you can tell me to the foot or
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
even to the mile of rail for the for the
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
rail that is of this Sub in this in this
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
Corridor that we're speaking about
 
01:39:15.629 --> 01:39:15.639 align:start position:0%
19 and and some of the others has has
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
any of that product been
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
reused for for projects within the same
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
Corridor when and when we say we're
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
storing I assuming we're not picking
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
that rail up and transporting it
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere else you are we are so if we do
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
Trail projects we'll try to bring if we
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
are going to salvage it for use on a
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
state owned line we try to bring it to
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
the closest Stockyard um or railroad
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
oper tenant that we have to put it for
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
future use this line that we're talking
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
about the the stone Conway branch is
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 21 miles long um with the
 
01:39:53.149 --> 01:39:53.159 align:start position:0%
exception of roadways where the rail has
 
01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
been taken out and the road has been
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
temporarily paved over we have not
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
removed any rail from those sections to
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
salvage anywhere else we'd have to go
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
and inspect and look at the weight of
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
the rail which may be lighter than we
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
use in a lot of places and the condition
 
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
of that rail to see whether or not it
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
has a reuse value to the state but we
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
have not completed that assessment at
 
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
this point would it would it be possible
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for your time I'm I'm
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
hoping there's a day you and I are going
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
to lunch and I'm not just asking you
 
01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:24.030 align:start position:0%
to lunch and I'm not just asking you
questions

01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:40:27.629 --> 01:40:27.639 align:start position:0%
that day is coming soon the
 
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
um Can is it possible to get an
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
inventory of of what that looks like
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
that that amount of rail that you have
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
stored historically is that is that
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
possible someone know what that
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
accounting is from that Corridor or
 
01:40:45.629 --> 01:40:45.639 align:start position:0%
Statewide oh we'll start with that
 
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
Corridor but Statewide would be nice to
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
know it it I don't need it for this week
 
01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
but if if I'd like I'd like to see what
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
that I would like to see what that is
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
there was another comment here by the um
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
by commissioner
 
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:03.709 align:start position:0%
by commissioner
Stewart

01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
Stewart
 
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
um Salvage steel now pass this along as
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
they keep in house for future use also
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
another new requirement is that we must
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
complete formal surveys of the Rails
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
prior to removal as they as they
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
consider the rails a survey Monument to
 
01:41:24.669 --> 01:41:24.679 align:start position:0%
determine the correct property
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
boundaries I'm I'm somewhat confused by
 
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
that statement because we have requested
 
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
in oy we have
 
01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.750 align:start position:0%
in oy we have
requested

01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
requested
 
01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
um layouts of of the uh of the rail road
 
01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
which showed where culverts were and
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
everything else and it it would appear
 
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
to me as a Layman who looks at plans
 
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
that line rail there there are defined
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
points monuments and so forth for and
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
that that I don't I don't know that that
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
statement's entirely I'd love to be
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
schooled on that am I
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
wrong I don't work for the Bureau of
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
RightWay but in talking with our
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
surveyors and appraisers the railroad
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
Val Maps some of which you may be
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
referring to um chair that show culverts
 
01:42:14.550 --> 01:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
those were developed in the 1800s
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
they're very Antiquated we don't have
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
newer layers uh in GIS at this point so
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
the monumentation is usually to know
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
what State owns is off the center line
 
01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
of the rail line so if you don't survey
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
and have those meets and Bounds of where
 
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
the current rail is before you pull it
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
out to become a trail it becomes an
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
issue when you work with the butters if
 
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
you say you own 30 or 45 feet off the
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
center line of track and the track is
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
not there and you have a trail that was
 
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
built and you don't have the confidence
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
that the trail was built directly on the
 
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
center line of track then you get into
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
an issue with every linear a butter
 
01:42:53.229 --> 01:42:53.239 align:start position:0%
along miles and miles so um it is
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
something that we did not require in the
 
01:42:58.109 --> 01:42:58.119 align:start position:0%
past that we have had problems dealing
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
with encroachers property U management
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
issues that uh Bureau of RightWay who
 
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
are experts in this field had said this
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
is really the only way to take all the
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
existing lines and use the existing Rail
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
lines and use that Center of rail to now
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
reestablish and be able to match up with
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
those uh original railroad valuation
 
01:43:20.669 --> 01:43:20.679 align:start position:0%
maps from the
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
1800s and I and I appreciate that that
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
conversation um but the if if it's a
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
center line and we have we have an
 
01:43:31.589 --> 01:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
existing rail that's running running
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
down running down making turns climbing
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
2% and so forth I would assume that the
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
only survey data that you were looking
 
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
for to be done to any standards is just
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
simply projecting what that Center Line
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
is down through there which which is a
 
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.390 align:start position:0%
is down through there which which is a
much

01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:43:53.709 --> 01:43:53.719 align:start position:0%
easier um
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
item to accomplish a um after the fact
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
and as built um is is that indeed all
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
that that all that the department is is
 
01:44:06.189 --> 01:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
asking for at this point in time are
 
01:44:09.149 --> 01:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
they looking to map not only the lines
 
01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
the center line The Edge and everything
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
else because that that's an expensive
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
process yeah I would have to double
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
check and we can follow back up I know
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
trying to establish just we the center
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
line and then everything else we can
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
measure off I believe but we'll formally
 
01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
follow up as with some of the other
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
information requested I I sincerely
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
time if uh if policy if the legislature
 
01:44:34.990 --> 01:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
was determined that a
 
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
policy change might be legislatively
 
01:44:41.229 --> 01:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
possible then that would be
 
01:44:44.189 --> 01:44:44.199 align:start position:0%
the the preview of the legislature I
 
01:44:44.199 --> 01:44:45.589 align:start position:0%
the the preview of the legislature I
would

01:44:45.589 --> 01:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
assume a policy a a policy if if a
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
policy change on on on the um on the um
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
on the use of the old
 
01:45:01.669 --> 01:45:01.679 align:start position:0%
rail sure yeah yeah it could be uh
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
legislated like I said our our our
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
practice has been you know primarily to
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
Def to defay or defer or yeah deey other
 
01:45:12.510 --> 01:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs on the on the active
 
01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
active Lines by um you know reusing what
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
is salvageable uh rail that's compatible
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
with the you know existing active lines
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you further questions for
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
the commissioner for the yes
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm a little
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
confused here because it seems like the
 
01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
system you said that you use you use the
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
existing rails to find the center but
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't GPS kind of done away with all
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
that or have you gone through and
 
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
changed everything over the GPS or do
 
01:45:47.589 --> 01:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
you still go out there and measure from
 
01:45:47.599 --> 01:45:49.030 align:start position:0%
you still go out there and measure from
the

01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
rails uh somebody would have to if we
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
have a piece of paper that that that
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
that shows the the valve plan that shows
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
the the the right of way um constraints
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
relative to the center line of of rail
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's whether it's fully surveyed
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
or GPS somebody would still have to go
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
out and physically do that and lay that
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
out from from the paper in in the field
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
so whether it's you know GPS or um or or
 
01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:17.870 align:start position:0%
so whether it's you know GPS or um or or
full

01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
survey there still an activity that has
 
01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.510 align:start position:0%
survey there still an activity that has
to

01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
happen is am I answering your question I
 
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
I it it to a degree but it seems like
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
we're doing keeping the rails for that
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
purpose once it's GPS it doesn't seem
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
like it needs to be done I know when you
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
do some roads like I live near 125 and
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
when that was done recently enough the
 
01:46:43.149 --> 01:46:43.159 align:start position:0%
measurements are so accurate that the
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
center of the road is actually the
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
center of the road so sometimes it would
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
seem like with the rails the center of
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
the rail may not be the center of the
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
rail unless it was done unless it was
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
updated so I guess my concern is that
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to keep those rails there
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
just so you know where the center is
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
when there's new ways to do it no I
 
01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
don't think we're saying keeping it
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
there for that I think the the the
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
answer to uh the Chairman's question was
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
when when there is a project to tear up
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
the existing rails and and remove them
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
before they are removed uh because of
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
past experiences and past problems we
 
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
are requiring a a survey of that Center
 
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
Line so it's a established before the
 
01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
before the rail line before the before
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
the rails and that monumentation of
 
01:47:31.990 --> 01:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
where the center line of the rail is is
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
lost as part of a trail project thank
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
you for the correction yeah represent
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
fauler I just trying to add that
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
essentially that process is taking the
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
rail which is the only Monument they
 
01:47:45.790 --> 01:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
have and replacing it with some other
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
Monument pins or or concrete bounds so
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
that they can measure property lines in
 
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
the future yes exactly it's once you've
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
established a new monument then you
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you but like like I think
 
01:48:03.629 --> 01:48:03.639 align:start position:0%
your your point representative is there
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
is there is a there is a there is a cost
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
to a uh somebody you know dncr or Trail
 
01:48:12.589 --> 01:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor developing that that project
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
there is an incremental cost to provide
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
that um um that monumentation that
 
01:48:21.790 --> 01:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
survey as part of their their project so
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
I I fully I fully understand that but
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
when we're we're dealing with a state
 
01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
when we're we're dealing with a state
agency

01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:31.229 align:start position:0%

01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
Trails
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
do um it would seem when when you have a
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
collaborative project there I I would I
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
know we're you're all operating as we
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
are in the public service with 25% less
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
than what we would like to have
 
01:48:50.350 --> 01:48:50.360 align:start position:0%
employees and and perhaps I'm completely
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
wrong because no one has told me this
 
01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
but it would seem to me the Department
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
of Transportation for a small section of
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
what I understand to be switching at
 
01:49:03.430 --> 01:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
intersections and things I I would hope
 
01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
that we could we could hope that
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
do Trail and rail possibly could share
 
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
some surveying and so forth um it would
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
just it would just seem to be the right
 
01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679 align:start position:0%
thing and I and I would hope that it's
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
already being done but if it's not I I
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
offer maybe a com ation perfect
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
good all right any anything else could
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
we end this on a happy note let's pull
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
up something here yes please represent
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh maybe it's not appropriate this at
 
01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
this time but are we going to be uh
 
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
maybe after lunch going through the
 
01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
project amendments we C we certainly are
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
that was that was my intent was to try
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
and get through most of this now and and
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
we'll go there thank you yep further
 
01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
questions why don't we uh why don't we
 
01:49:55.629 --> 01:49:55.639 align:start position:0%
stop at this point and we will come back
 
01:49:55.639 --> 01:49:56.510 align:start position:0%
stop at this point and we will come back
at

01:49:56.510 --> 01:49:56.520 align:start position:0%

03:08:08.830 --> 03:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to go ahead and open up our
 
03:08:12.429 --> 03:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon session here um before we
 
03:08:15.229 --> 03:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
start speaking of uh project
 
03:08:18.190 --> 03:08:18.200 align:start position:0%
amendments uh were there time you had
 
03:08:20.110 --> 03:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
for lunch were there any other questions
 
03:08:22.950 --> 03:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
that were generated from this morning's
 
03:08:26.030 --> 03:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh conversation which centered around uh
 
03:08:26.040 --> 03:08:28.229 align:start position:0%
uh conversation which centered around uh
this

03:08:28.229 --> 03:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:08:31.630 --> 03:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
handout seeing none oh I'm sorry please
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent below thank you I
 
03:08:38.309 --> 03:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:38.319 --> 03:08:40.670 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:08:40.670 --> 03:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:44.510 --> 03:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry if I missed this but so
 
03:08:47.389 --> 03:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
there's red list but what how do you dis
 
03:08:49.309 --> 03:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
distinguish between bridges that just
 
03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
get on the red list and those that are
 
03:08:52.830 --> 03:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
in real need Ian like what's the
 
03:08:54.389 --> 03:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
differentiation is there a score that
 
03:08:56.830 --> 03:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
goes with that yes so we do a bridge
 
03:08:59.630 --> 03:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
inspection every on a a regular bridge a
 
03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
non- red listed Bridge every two years
 
03:09:03.469 --> 03:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
on a red listed Bridge every year so
 
03:09:05.950 --> 03:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
what we do is we inspect three
 
03:09:08.269 --> 03:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
components the deck the super structure
 
03:09:09.910 --> 03:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
which is the steel that holds a deck up
 
03:09:11.389 --> 03:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
and then the substructure which is the
 
03:09:14.830 --> 03:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
foundations and the peers and uh they're
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
given a rating of 0 to 10 really 10
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
being a brand new bridge and zero being
 
03:09:24.110 --> 03:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
it's probably in the water um and
 
03:09:26.269 --> 03:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
anything under a any any component that
 
03:09:29.910 --> 03:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
rates a four or less is added to the
 
03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
lead red list that means it needs needs
 
03:09:37.790 --> 03:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
some work um to increase its capacity
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
increase its
 
03:09:43.750 --> 03:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
structural um uh structural Integrity uh
 
03:09:46.750 --> 03:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
to get it off the red list usually
 
03:09:48.750 --> 03:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see a down posting once it's on
 
03:09:51.630 --> 03:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
the Red List uh because it's uh either
 
03:09:53.710 --> 03:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
rusted or there's some loss of
 
03:09:56.349 --> 03:09:56.359 align:start position:0%
structural Integrity that that means it
 
03:09:59.309 --> 03:09:59.319 align:start position:0%
can't support you know full Highway
 
03:09:59.319 --> 03:10:01.550 align:start position:0%
can't support you know full Highway
loads

03:10:01.550 --> 03:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
loads
 
03:10:04.429 --> 03:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
um when we inspect them every year
 
03:10:06.830 --> 03:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's when we do that rating and it'll
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
will compare the rating or any change
 
03:10:11.429 --> 03:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
versus the last inspection and then that
 
03:10:14.990 --> 03:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
determinations made what that score is
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
um if it if it any component goes to
 
03:10:20.910 --> 03:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
below a four a four or less um it gets
 
03:10:24.670 --> 03:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
added to the Red List um if it's higher
 
03:10:29.309 --> 03:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
than that we we use that as an indicator
 
03:10:31.070 --> 03:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
um when a when a one of the components
 
03:10:34.309 --> 03:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
is a five it's really close to be a
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
problem um it could stay a five for five
 
03:10:40.750 --> 03:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
years 10 years 20 years we every bridge
 
03:10:43.389 --> 03:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
is a little different uh before it it
 
03:10:46.950 --> 03:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
makes the jump to a a red list so that
 
03:10:46.960 --> 03:10:48.349 align:start position:0%
makes the jump to a a red list so that
that

03:10:48.349 --> 03:10:48.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:10:50.990 --> 03:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
the red list is just sort of a litmus
 
03:10:53.670 --> 03:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
test that we need to really pay better
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
attention to that bridge just followup
 
03:10:59.469 --> 03:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
and the followup is just so your
 
03:11:01.950 --> 03:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
priority is set by the lowest Bridges
 
03:11:03.389 --> 03:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
with the lowest scores get the the
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
highest priority is that correct or is
 
03:11:07.590 --> 03:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
that is there no there's a we have a a
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
bridge committee that
 
03:11:12.349 --> 03:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
reviews um each Bridge
 
03:11:15.389 --> 03:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
individually um so an example is a an
 
03:11:17.950 --> 03:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
interstate Bridge has a higher priority
 
03:11:20.349 --> 03:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
so it may rank higher be higher on the
 
03:11:22.349 --> 03:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
replacement Bridge than a than a a
 
03:11:24.550 --> 03:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
secondary or or a tier three or four
 
03:11:26.750 --> 03:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
Bridge they may both be in the same
 
03:11:30.030 --> 03:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
condition but because of the volume um
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
and everything else that the that the
 
03:11:33.630 --> 03:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
bridge handles it might be higher on the
 
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
L last okay thank
 
03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
you representative Jack uh thank you
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
didn't we some years ago enact a
 
03:11:43.030 --> 03:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
definition of red list for this purpose
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
so that functionally obsolete was not
 
03:11:47.389 --> 03:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
considered but structurally deficient
 
03:11:50.590 --> 03:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
was so that we wouldn't get so that we
 
03:11:52.150 --> 03:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
get the the structually deficient
 
03:11:55.670 --> 03:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
bridges on the red L correct correct so
 
03:11:58.710 --> 03:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
a a covered bridge still a bridge it'll
 
03:12:00.269 --> 03:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
always be on the red list because it
 
03:12:02.590 --> 03:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
can't hold loads so you know it was that
 
03:12:04.389 --> 03:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
definition that allowed us to take some
 
03:12:06.790 --> 03:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
of these bridges that are always going
 
03:12:09.150 --> 03:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
to be red listed like that off of the
 
03:12:12.030 --> 03:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
red list so that we weren't focusing our
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
attention on those type of bridges yes
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:23.229 --> 03:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
okay we are going to uh move on to now
 
03:12:25.469 --> 03:12:25.479 align:start position:0%
start speaking of the
 
03:12:29.469 --> 03:12:29.479 align:start position:0%
draft uh amendments as necessary for the
 
03:12:32.150 --> 03:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
10-year Plan before we do that I'd like
 
03:12:35.070 --> 03:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
to represent I'd like to uh
 
03:12:37.309 --> 03:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative Jack yeah there's been
 
03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
some confusion about I mean House Bill
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
2024 says enact the book which is this
 
03:12:46.110 --> 03:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh so the question is uh we're we're
 
03:12:47.750 --> 03:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
some of us are confused about whether
 
03:12:50.229 --> 03:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
the projects on this page that you just
 
03:12:52.990 --> 03:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
handed out need to be amended into house
 
03:12:59.429 --> 03:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:03.070 --> 03:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
book so that's probably a Nuance that I
 
03:13:05.150 --> 03:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't prepared for but if all these
 
03:13:07.750 --> 03:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
projects are in the book some of them
 
03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
are changes to dollar amounts some of
 
03:13:12.830 --> 03:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
them are changes where we've removed a
 
03:13:17.469 --> 03:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
project so um the idea would be is that
 
03:13:19.750 --> 03:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
these are
 
03:13:22.830 --> 03:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
changes to projects that are either are
 
03:13:25.429 --> 03:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
are in the book well follow up then but
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
if you're changing the dollar amount
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
that changes what should be in the book
 
03:13:32.190 --> 03:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
amendment so I believe we update the
 
03:13:38.510 --> 03:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
book prior to it being signed so these
 
03:13:40.269 --> 03:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
are recommendations that we'd like to
 
03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
make to the book and with your okay or
 
03:13:47.309 --> 03:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
approval we will make these changes and
 
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
they will appear in the book that is
 
03:13:52.590 --> 03:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
signed in the
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
law okay so if if that's the case and
 
03:13:57.790 --> 03:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
sure I I I I believe in the past and I'm
 
03:14:05.550 --> 03:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
always open to be told I'm wrong is that
 
03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
house bill like in this year
 
03:14:11.550 --> 03:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
2024 would would show up as
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
amended with changes and you're you're
 
03:14:17.870 --> 03:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
the impression you can get back to it
 
03:14:19.910 --> 03:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
whether it comes through not as because
 
03:14:21.550 --> 03:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
I guess my question would be if this
 
03:14:23.870 --> 03:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
committee were to ask for an
 
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to be included in the 10-year
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
plan at what point does it become
 
03:14:33.389 --> 03:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
amended it would seem or is the
 
03:14:35.469 --> 03:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
Department's position that if we come up
 
03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
with a committee Amendment it goes into
 
03:14:41.070 --> 03:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
that book it's not amended so we and
 
03:14:42.030 --> 03:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
like the
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
past legislation that that is in the
 
03:14:47.630 --> 03:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
book okay would have the bill with the
 
03:14:50.469 --> 03:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
with these project amendments
 
03:14:55.349 --> 03:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
in in the wording of of House Bill 2024
 
03:14:57.030 --> 03:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
and that would be part of in the front
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the book
 
03:15:03.750 --> 03:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm not so yes I think the the
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
project amendments would appear
 
03:15:09.790 --> 03:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2024 as
 
03:15:12.309 --> 03:15:12.319 align:start position:0%
amendments repr I
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
believe right so my question is if
 
03:15:18.510 --> 03:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
somebody looks up House Bill 2024 as
 
03:15:20.830 --> 03:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
introduced do they get this
 
03:15:24.150 --> 03:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
book or is there some other language
 
03:15:25.229 --> 03:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
that's in the
 
03:15:29.110 --> 03:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced I I don't believe the
 
03:15:31.750 --> 03:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
book is the item that comes forward
 
03:15:35.070 --> 03:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
it's so somebody from the public can
 
03:15:37.469 --> 03:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
they can they find this online if they
 
03:15:41.590 --> 03:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
were looking for the Bill yes yes the
 
03:15:46.510 --> 03:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
the book is on on one yeah so then okay
 
03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps we could get we could get that
 
03:15:52.189 --> 03:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
answer just so we know the the intent is
 
03:15:55.590 --> 03:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
if if we can reach agreement that we get
 
03:15:59.030 --> 03:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
whatever change is done and if there is
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so that we can possibly vote
 
03:16:05.229 --> 03:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
for this as a committee this week on
 
03:16:07.150 --> 03:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
Friday when we're scheduled and if it
 
03:16:09.309 --> 03:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
can't happen this week then it'll be two
 
03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
weeks out because we'll be I don't
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
intend on bringing the committee in next
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
week when we're not in session okay
 
03:16:19.469 --> 03:16:19.479 align:start position:0%
we we will figure that out
 
03:16:23.150 --> 03:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
okay rep s melson thank you Mr chairman
 
03:16:27.269 --> 03:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh this is just going back last week and
 
03:16:28.710 --> 03:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
I asked this question I just want to
 
03:16:30.550 --> 03:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
make sure we're all on the same page
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
with this we got a little package with
 
03:16:35.469 --> 03:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
project amendments on it and things like
 
03:16:40.189 --> 03:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
that last week and as far as I can tell
 
03:16:43.030 --> 03:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
these last week's project amendments are
 
03:16:45.630 --> 03:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
already in this book
 
03:16:48.670 --> 03:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
03:16:51.030 --> 03:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking at at til well there's
 
03:16:53.189 --> 03:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
we have we have a differing opinion per
 
03:16:55.189 --> 03:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
I'm look at tilon
 
03:16:57.670 --> 03:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
42600 from the from right off the top
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
and it said remove roundabout from scope
 
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
and if I look at it the the roundabout
 
03:17:07.150 --> 03:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
is been removed so that was that was the
 
03:17:11.349 --> 03:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
list of gaset changes right and so the
 
03:17:14.630 --> 03:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
the the gas changes are in the book
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
because that book was printed for the
 
03:17:20.189 --> 03:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
governor then the governor's office
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
changes are in the
 
03:17:27.229 --> 03:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
book then the do administrative update
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:17:34.229 --> 03:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
44493 on on ADD project back to the book
 
03:17:36.389 --> 03:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
are not in the book that's not in the
 
03:17:40.110 --> 03:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
book The do administrative updates Okay
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
repr g then J
 
03:17:46.830 --> 03:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
Jack well uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:17:48.630 --> 03:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
and thanks for answering the question or
 
03:17:52.910 --> 03:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
my comment um basically you know there
 
03:17:54.429 --> 03:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
at least one exception to what's not in
 
03:17:55.870 --> 03:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
the book and that is the
 
03:17:58.429 --> 03:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
causeway the causeway is on this list
 
03:17:59.670 --> 03:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's not on the
 
03:18:02.670 --> 03:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
book um which is quite an item for
 
03:18:06.429 --> 03:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
people and then I'll we'll go over some
 
03:18:07.910 --> 03:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
others after that's just want to mention
 
03:18:09.030 --> 03:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
that right
 
03:18:13.150 --> 03:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
now so response for that so it
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
was It was supposed to be in the book it
 
03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
was all written up and ready to be in
 
03:18:21.189 --> 03:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
the book it's just a button wasn't
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
pushed so it didn't print in the book so
 
03:18:27.070 --> 03:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
it's it this this change will put it in
 
03:18:29.070 --> 03:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
the book
 
03:18:34.030 --> 03:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
um and it was as promised um you know
 
03:18:36.110 --> 03:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
Construction in I
 
03:18:40.990 --> 03:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
think 32 33 and um we Advanced the
 
03:18:45.750 --> 03:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
design uh to to start in 26 okay so we
 
03:18:48.110 --> 03:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
agreed to advance the design as part of
 
03:18:49.469 --> 03:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
the gaset
 
03:18:52.950 --> 03:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
process represent represent Jack well
 
03:18:55.349 --> 03:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still confused so now it sounds
 
03:18:58.870 --> 03:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
like the Adit the last section are
 
03:19:00.309 --> 03:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
things that are not in the book and
 
03:19:02.030 --> 03:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
would need to be added by an amendment
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment maybe does does Kathy M hamson
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
remember how this was done in the past
 
03:19:11.439 --> 03:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
remember how this was done in the past
Maybe

03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.429 --> 03:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.439 --> 03:19:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:19:49.510 --> 03:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:54.269 --> 03:19:54.279 align:start position:0%
if please if I may yes it's my
 
03:19:56.269 --> 03:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
understanding that this amendment we are
 
03:19:59.429 --> 03:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
asking you to pass is an administrative
 
03:20:02.269 --> 03:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment these are changes that we are
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
aware of that need to be made to the
 
03:20:09.750 --> 03:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
book since the the ex gasset had it and
 
03:20:12.510 --> 03:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
since the governor had it it is true
 
03:20:14.910 --> 03:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
that some of these projects on this list
 
03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
are already in the plan and these are
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
dollar value changes that exceed a
 
03:20:22.389 --> 03:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we're asking this
 
03:20:25.269 --> 03:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
committee to approve so we can update
 
03:20:28.269 --> 03:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
the book once again as it leaves house
 
03:20:31.630 --> 03:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
trans house Public Works and goes to
 
03:20:31.640 --> 03:20:33.469 align:start position:0%
trans house Public Works and goes to
Senate

03:20:33.469 --> 03:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation so with your approval of
 
03:20:39.150 --> 03:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment we will again update the
 
03:20:39.160 --> 03:20:40.030 align:start position:0%
this amendment we will again update the
the

03:20:40.030 --> 03:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:20:43.150 --> 03:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
book so my question I I understand that
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
part so if this committee were to have a
 
03:20:49.269 --> 03:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment or two amendments to be added
 
03:20:50.910 --> 03:20:50.920 align:start position:0%
that would have to be incorporated into
 
03:20:53.189 --> 03:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
the book when you're doing that so when
 
03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
it comes to the floor it's still going
 
03:20:57.229 --> 03:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
to be House Bill
 
03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:06.070 --> 03:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
amended because I I remember in the past
 
03:21:09.710 --> 03:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
I thought it had been rep
 
03:21:13.389 --> 03:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
boy has the legislative language to 2024
 
03:21:19.990 --> 03:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:32.590 align:start position:0%
 
it's

03:21:32.590 --> 03:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
draft okay follow up my my understanding
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
is that 2024 is a place saver until the
 
03:21:39.309 --> 03:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
legislative language is actually drawn
 
03:21:43.590 --> 03:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
sorry but it says draft on it m says
 
03:21:50.229 --> 03:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
draft okay I'm saying this because
 
03:21:52.830 --> 03:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
follow Mr chairman yes I'm saying this
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
because if the legislative language
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
hasn't been drafted yet then what's
 
03:21:58.510 --> 03:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
being proposed by do is Administrative
 
03:21:59.830 --> 03:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
it's an administrative Amendment to the
 
03:22:02.110 --> 03:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
book because once once we approve this
 
03:22:03.550 --> 03:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
the legislative language is going to be
 
03:22:05.630 --> 03:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
drafted and that'll be put that'll be
 
03:22:07.389 --> 03:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
Bill include the book well which will
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:31.389 --> 03:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
so what what it does say it said 10-year
 
03:22:33.550 --> 03:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
plan Improvement plan the legisl here
 
03:22:35.229 --> 03:22:35.239 align:start position:0%
adopts the plan known as state of New
 
03:22:38.269 --> 03:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 10year Improvement plan 2025
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
to 34 submitted by the governor to the
 
03:22:43.710 --> 03:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
legislature pursuant to the RSA and
 
03:22:46.030 --> 03:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
encourages expenditure implementation of
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
the project shown
 
03:22:51.670 --> 03:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
therein so if that's the case then the
 
03:22:55.150 --> 03:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
governor's plan does not the the book
 
03:22:57.790 --> 03:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
from the governors doesn't doesn't have
 
03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
these changes in it so I would assume
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
that all of these changes would have to
 
03:23:06.030 --> 03:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
be an amendment to the bill and I think
 
03:23:08.590 --> 03:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
in the previous copy we saw the verbiage
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
to the bill and then amendments and it
 
03:23:12.189 --> 03:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
would list a project and the change
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
after it and it would be a it was about
 
03:23:17.590 --> 03:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
a Page worth of just project names and
 
03:23:21.389 --> 03:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
and changes that were amended are we
 
03:23:23.670 --> 03:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you uh why don't we
 
03:23:30.670 --> 03:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
we'd had a discussion just previous you
 
03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak in groups on on these
 
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
projects or individually how would you
 
03:23:38.590 --> 03:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
like to handle that sir so I I'll talk
 
03:23:40.510 --> 03:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
in gener generalities if you have
 
03:23:42.309 --> 03:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
specific questions you want to talk
 
03:23:45.189 --> 03:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
about uh just let me know so in the
 
03:23:47.710 --> 03:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
slides I'm sorry represent I didn't see
 
03:23:49.150 --> 03:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
you had a
 
03:23:53.950 --> 03:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um as as
 
03:23:56.670 --> 03:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
far as this amendments concerned in
 
03:23:59.309 --> 03:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
generalities that have you you have
 
03:24:03.309 --> 03:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
recommended projects removals and then
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
updates because the dollars you have
 
03:24:11.110 --> 03:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
more accurate dollars to put into it um
 
03:24:14.670 --> 03:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
if my memory serves me
 
03:24:17.830 --> 03:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
correct this reflect
 
03:24:19.710 --> 03:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
projects that have not been applied for
 
03:24:21.349 --> 03:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:24:24.990 --> 03:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
grant so if you take one of these
 
03:24:27.870 --> 03:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
projects and apply for a grant for it
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
and get grant money does that mean you
 
03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
have to have another amendment to do
 
03:24:35.710 --> 03:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
something different because the money
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
has been
 
03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
allocated no I
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm confused because I would
 
03:24:46.670 --> 03:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
say no I I mean we would be usually when
 
03:24:48.910 --> 03:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
you get a grant you have a fully funded
 
03:24:50.389 --> 03:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
project and you're taking grant money
 
03:24:53.349 --> 03:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
and swapping out for f regular for
 
03:24:55.590 --> 03:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
different federal funds so there's isn't
 
03:24:58.590 --> 03:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
a change in in dollar value it's a
 
03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
change of funding source so I would say
 
03:25:04.349 --> 03:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
no but let me let me try to explain a
 
03:25:07.150 --> 03:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
little bit about what this is and and
 
03:25:09.309 --> 03:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
and where these come from so you
 
03:25:11.429 --> 03:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
remember we we sort of talked about it
 
03:25:13.870 --> 03:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
last week at the at at the public
 
03:25:18.910 --> 03:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
hearing was um we we we take a snapshot
 
03:25:21.229 --> 03:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year plan back in
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
June and we take that snapshot and we
 
03:25:29.590 --> 03:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
use that as as the book because we can't
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
track all the changes that happened in
 
03:25:34.469 --> 03:25:34.479 align:start position:0%
the last six months on projects we we
 
03:25:37.150 --> 03:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
actively working on them they you know
 
03:25:38.790 --> 03:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
projects are changing projects are
 
03:25:41.790 --> 03:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
advancing projects are being constructed
 
03:25:44.830 --> 03:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
and to keep track of them in this book
 
03:25:48.670 --> 03:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
would be very painful and very hard it
 
03:25:50.750 --> 03:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
would be you know five people doing this
 
03:25:53.469 --> 03:25:53.479 align:start position:0%
all day long so what we do is we take a
 
03:25:56.110 --> 03:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
snapshot of of the book and we bring
 
03:25:58.309 --> 03:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
that forward and we move it into gasset
 
03:26:02.309 --> 03:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
in Governor's phase we make some changes
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
gasset said make changes to
 
03:26:07.150 --> 03:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
this we make changes to the governor's
 
03:26:08.990 --> 03:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
face now the governor has proposed
 
03:26:11.590 --> 03:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
changes those are not reflected in the
 
03:26:14.070 --> 03:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
book but they were just a handful of
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
changes but in real life for the last
 
03:26:18.870 --> 03:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
six months we've been working on a lot
 
03:26:20.990 --> 03:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
of projects and advancing projects and
 
03:26:24.950 --> 03:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
moving projects this list is what's
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
happened to the 10-year plan in those
 
03:26:30.790 --> 03:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
last six or nine months since we took
 
03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
that snapshot so these are the changes
 
03:26:37.189 --> 03:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
that we recommend that to to basically
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
reflect real life of of what needs to be
 
03:26:42.229 --> 03:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
changed in the 10e plan to re reflect
 
03:26:45.990 --> 03:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
where these projects are now so the the
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
first first projects on the list now
 
03:26:52.870 --> 03:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
these should be the same if not very
 
03:26:55.670 --> 03:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
similar to the slides in the project so
 
03:26:58.349 --> 03:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just refer to the sheet so
 
03:27:00.030 --> 03:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
the very top of the sheet there's four
 
03:27:02.830 --> 03:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
projects Claremont London area and two
 
03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
Northampton those projects were not
 
03:27:08.910 --> 03:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
shown in the 10-year plan because they
 
03:27:10.510 --> 03:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
were going to be constructed in all
 
03:27:14.150 --> 03:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
2024 10e plan starts in 2025 so they
 
03:27:20.750 --> 03:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't appear these four projects due
 
03:27:23.469 --> 03:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
to delays um and and being able to
 
03:27:27.630 --> 03:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
advertise the project have moved from 24
 
03:27:27.640 --> 03:27:28.590 align:start position:0%
advertise the project have moved from 24
into

03:27:28.590 --> 03:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:27:32.309 --> 03:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
25 so some component either the entire
 
03:27:34.510 --> 03:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
project or or half of the project has
 
03:27:37.990 --> 03:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
moved into 2025 that means that project
 
03:27:40.150 --> 03:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be added into the 10-year plan
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
because it's shown in in in the first
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
year of the 10-year plan so these four
 
03:27:47.229 --> 03:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
projects are simply these projects moved
 
03:27:48.510 --> 03:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
they weren't shown in the 10-year plan
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
now they are in the 10year
 
03:27:55.870 --> 03:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
plan so the the next group of projects
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I I will say these are projects over
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
a million dollars this list would get
 
03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
quite long in this next section um or
 
03:28:05.070 --> 03:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry in in a future section uh if
 
03:28:06.510 --> 03:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
they're under a million dollars because
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
of Penny changes so I'll call them
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
Pocket Change changes these are major
 
03:28:16.189 --> 03:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
changes to this to the 10-year plan so
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
the next group of projects are
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
recommended projects to withdraw so from
 
03:28:23.469 --> 03:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
Gastown down to Waterville
 
03:28:25.670 --> 03:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
Valley most of these projects that
 
03:28:28.269 --> 03:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see are LPA
 
03:28:32.830 --> 03:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
projects um they were withdrawn by the
 
03:28:37.550 --> 03:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
community uh at at their request so in
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
in some components give you an example
 
03:28:44.349 --> 03:28:44.359 align:start position:0%
um project was removed because it
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
entered the entered as a
 
03:28:48.750 --> 03:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
a rehabilitation of the bridge at a
 
03:28:51.229 --> 03:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
certain dollar value and come to find
 
03:28:53.070 --> 03:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
out it needs to be replaced the
 
03:28:54.750 --> 03:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
community couldn't afford the larger
 
03:28:56.750 --> 03:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
dollar value to replace the bridge so
 
03:28:57.990 --> 03:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do the project
 
03:28:59.830 --> 03:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to withdraw the project
 
03:29:03.510 --> 03:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
and in some cases um
 
03:29:07.189 --> 03:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
like uh Manchester hooks it we advance
 
03:29:12.750 --> 03:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
the project um there's a project
 
03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
in I yeah could I bring your attention
 
03:29:19.229 --> 03:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
into that project 41580 in molteno I
 
03:29:21.790 --> 03:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
know there's several projects so just
 
03:29:24.510 --> 03:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
that part was taken out and and
 
03:29:26.590 --> 03:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
reallocated to a different different
 
03:29:28.590 --> 03:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
priority a different priority in
 
03:29:33.189 --> 03:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
molenberg yes okay thank you so th all
 
03:29:37.710 --> 03:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
those projects are shown as being
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawn um I will say that there are
 
03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
two that are showing Advanced so
 
03:29:45.750 --> 03:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester hooks it the second project
 
03:29:49.349 --> 03:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
and then the Salem project um both of
 
03:29:51.950 --> 03:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
those uh projects were advanced in the
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
10-year plan so not what WR so we we
 
03:29:57.189 --> 03:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
were able to do them faster so
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester hooks it is um five Bridges
 
03:30:04.710 --> 03:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation bridges on um
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
i93 um there's these are the Northbound
 
03:30:10.510 --> 03:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
Bridges if you travel that way for the
 
03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
last two years you've been in the Mayhem
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
of traffic control on the southbound
 
03:30:17.550 --> 03:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
Bridges um we're now doing those same
 
03:30:19.389 --> 03:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
five bridges on the on the Northbound
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
side we are able to advance those
 
03:30:24.150 --> 03:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
because the bridges on the southbound
 
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
side were completed earlier so we could
 
03:30:29.229 --> 03:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
Advance these and do these right away
 
03:30:32.229 --> 03:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:35.030 --> 03:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
expected so that's that grouping of
 
03:30:37.309 --> 03:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
projects now the next group that starts
 
03:30:40.150 --> 03:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page um well let me
 
03:30:44.750 --> 03:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:46.469 --> 03:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
List yes
 
03:30:49.550 --> 03:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you maybe just for my okay so in
 
03:30:52.469 --> 03:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
this second section if it's an advanced
 
03:30:55.870 --> 03:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
project which is the Manchester hookset
 
03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
and Salem correct they are in they're in
 
03:31:03.750 --> 03:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
a plan yes not
 
03:31:05.790 --> 03:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily they are in this one they
 
03:31:08.550 --> 03:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
should be in that plan okay and and all
 
03:31:11.429 --> 03:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
we did was we moved them up okay the
 
03:31:13.830 --> 03:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
others that Clearly say removed or have
 
03:31:16.469 --> 03:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
a withdrawn in them
 
03:31:18.670 --> 03:31:18.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry let me let me correct
 
03:31:23.710 --> 03:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
that so they were Advanced from 25 into
 
03:31:26.389 --> 03:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
24 which means they'll be REM they're
 
03:31:28.349 --> 03:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
they won't show up in the 10-year plan
 
03:31:28.359 --> 03:31:30.309 align:start position:0%
they won't show up in the 10-year plan
I'm

03:31:30.309 --> 03:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:31:33.269 --> 03:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
sorry okay follow not to confuse you
 
03:31:35.910 --> 03:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
totally but they were in the project by
 
03:31:39.550 --> 03:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
moving them back we moved them ahead
 
03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
forward so they would have been in the
 
03:31:44.950 --> 03:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
10year plan they show up in 2025 in the
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
first year of the 10e plan what we were
 
03:31:48.870 --> 03:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
able to do is actually construct them
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
sooner Advance them into
 
03:31:55.189 --> 03:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
2024 so they don't appear in the 10-year
 
03:31:58.870 --> 03:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
plan anymore they're done right they're
 
03:32:02.150 --> 03:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
done done they will be done okay yes all
 
03:32:04.670 --> 03:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
right thank you I was lost in jumbo
 
03:32:06.510 --> 03:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
03:32:08.830 --> 03:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
bone just so I get this straight so
 
03:32:12.030 --> 03:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
basically you've saved all this money
 
03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's why so from the 10 from the
 
03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
10year plan that you're proposing you
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
would have had to spend this money but
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
because you've already finished these
 
03:32:21.389 --> 03:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
projects that's a savings or we didn't
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
build or we or we removed them yes so
 
03:32:26.790 --> 03:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
you get $96 million on on
 
03:32:29.790 --> 03:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
bridges that are in this section right
 
03:32:32.510 --> 03:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
here so that's it's not like you're
 
03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
saying we're not going to do those you
 
03:32:35.670 --> 03:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
say you've already right you're working
 
03:32:38.229 --> 03:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
on those and they'll be done for 25
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
before 25 so let me so there is a a
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
correction so let me the the Statewide
 
03:32:46.590 --> 03:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
red listed Bridges $96 million
 
03:32:47.790 --> 03:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
that was a
 
03:32:51.469 --> 03:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
placeholder project in
 
03:32:55.710 --> 03:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
200 32 33 and 34 we knew we were going
 
03:32:57.870 --> 03:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
to spend money on red listed Bridges we
 
03:33:00.269 --> 03:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
didn't know which ones but we had set
 
03:33:03.070 --> 03:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
aside a placeholder project what you'll
 
03:33:04.990 --> 03:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
see is the very first project in the
 
03:33:07.150 --> 03:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
next section is Bo
 
03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
conquered which happens to be under
 
03:33:14.349 --> 03:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
construction in in those years um that
 
03:33:17.950 --> 03:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
project is large the largest project in
 
03:33:21.429 --> 03:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan $500 million total um
 
03:33:23.429 --> 03:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a number of years it
 
03:33:26.349 --> 03:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
involves 31 Bridges seven of them are
 
03:33:29.750 --> 03:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
red listed um six
 
03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
interchanges miles of Road um with a
 
03:33:35.790 --> 03:33:35.800 align:start position:0%
butload of traffic in the middle so it's
 
03:33:38.429 --> 03:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
very complicated what we plan to do is
 
03:33:40.510 --> 03:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
we took that that money that was
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
allocated the $96 million that was as a
 
03:33:45.070 --> 03:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
placeholder to replace red listed
 
03:33:48.269 --> 03:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
bridges in the future and put them uh
 
03:33:50.229 --> 03:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
towards Bo conquered to replace those
 
03:33:54.030 --> 03:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
seven red listed Bridges so the money
 
03:33:56.670 --> 03:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
you saved in the second section is
 
03:33:59.830 --> 03:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
actually going to be spent U plus some
 
03:34:01.469 --> 03:34:01.479 align:start position:0%
in the next section because the next
 
03:34:04.469 --> 03:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
section are changes in really in dollar
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
values to projects in the 10-year plan
 
03:34:10.429 --> 03:34:10.439 align:start position:0%
followup so could you just say that so
 
03:34:13.630 --> 03:34:13.640 align:start position:0%
you said that you're there's seven
 
03:34:16.349 --> 03:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
projects that were
 
03:34:18.990 --> 03:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
Seven Bridges Seven Bridges correct how
 
03:34:20.510 --> 03:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
much was the value of those seven
 
03:34:21.790 --> 03:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
projects added
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
up well so we we haven't figured that
 
03:34:28.870 --> 03:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
out just quite yet um
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
but it the idea is that 31 Bridges seven
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
of them are red listed um the idea would
 
03:34:38.229 --> 03:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
be is it's about 90 we put the $96
 
03:34:41.349 --> 03:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:44.790 --> 03:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
bridges it's a work in progress yes we
 
03:34:46.870 --> 03:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's because the project is so far
 
03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
out we haven't gotten to the point where
 
03:34:49.319 --> 03:34:51.150 align:start position:0%
out we haven't gotten to the point where
we've

03:34:51.150 --> 03:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
we've
 
03:34:53.309 --> 03:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
separated all those bridges all those
 
03:34:56.189 --> 03:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
interchanges all those projects into
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
into uh sections we're not going to
 
03:35:01.389 --> 03:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
build $500 million at once we know that
 
03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to have 10 or so
 
03:35:05.950 --> 03:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
projects that come out of it we haven't
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
divvied them up
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
yet so it's it that you know we're just
 
03:35:13.990 --> 03:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
at the point where we've figured out a
 
03:35:15.990 --> 03:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
selected alternative
 
03:35:18.550 --> 03:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
and going to a public hearing next year
 
03:35:20.189 --> 03:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
once we figure out what we're actually
 
03:35:21.550 --> 03:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
building then we'll figure out how we're
 
03:35:23.790 --> 03:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
going to build it and separate that out
 
03:35:26.469 --> 03:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
but the idea would be is that that that
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
red listed Bridge money was going to go
 
03:35:31.750 --> 03:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
into Bo conquered to fund those
 
03:35:33.870 --> 03:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
bridges thank
 
03:35:37.150 --> 03:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
you further question please continue all
 
03:35:40.110 --> 03:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
right so the the bottom section are
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
changes and updates so um projects
 
03:35:46.870 --> 03:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
removed in the second section was $111
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
million um the the the funding
 
03:35:53.150 --> 03:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
added uh due to these changes on the
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
bottom of the first sheet and on the
 
03:35:57.070 --> 03:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
second sheet is $154 million so your
 
03:35:59.590 --> 03:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
assumption that yes we removed projects
 
03:36:02.030 --> 03:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
we had money left over all went to fund
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
these projects that we now added money
 
03:36:08.150 --> 03:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
to so um the the project starting at BO
 
03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
conquered and weaving down to Portsmouth
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
were uh changes in costs due to increase
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
in cost for those projects um in some
 
03:36:21.469 --> 03:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
cases depending on the size of the
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
project I'll use an example Manchester
 
03:36:26.670 --> 03:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
those are the three Manchester projects
 
03:36:29.229 --> 03:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
on the on the second page are exit six
 
03:36:32.510 --> 03:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
and seven uh total project value is is
 
03:36:34.150 --> 03:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
upwards of $200
 
03:36:37.309 --> 03:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
million um you you tweak that a year and
 
03:36:40.070 --> 03:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
you add 3.7% inflation to a year and
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
you've got this money so some of this is
 
03:36:45.070 --> 03:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
just tweaking the scheduling of a
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
project adds inflation to that project
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
so um some of these projects were uh
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
updated in cost based upon actual
 
03:36:57.110 --> 03:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
estimates and others were adjusting for
 
03:37:00.389 --> 03:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
inflation uh due to schedule
 
03:37:04.990 --> 03:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
changes and then um finally the last the
 
03:37:07.309 --> 03:37:07.319 align:start position:0%
last project on the list is an
 
03:37:09.229 --> 03:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
administrative correction which adds the
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
New Castle Ry Causeway project back into
 
03:37:14.790 --> 03:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan which as we noted was a
 
03:37:18.990 --> 03:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
mistake so the total change in value of
 
03:37:24.630 --> 03:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
this change overall is um $55
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
million needed to to do
 
03:37:30.950 --> 03:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
this so
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
that I I just mentioned the total
 
03:37:35.309 --> 03:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
because that's how the numbers add up
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
some projects were removed more projects
 
03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
were changed and increased in value we
 
03:37:44.830 --> 03:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
still have a constraint 10-year plan
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
that absorbs and distributes that $55
 
03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
million so that it there isn't a change
 
03:37:52.870 --> 03:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
but that's those are the changes that
 
03:37:54.429 --> 03:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
have happened in the 10-year plan to
 
03:37:56.950 --> 03:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
bring us up to
 
03:38:00.710 --> 03:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:02.990 --> 03:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee yes representive
 
03:38:06.150 --> 03:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
edar uh thank you Mr
 
03:38:08.309 --> 03:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
chair you've done a lot of work here
 
03:38:09.790 --> 03:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
given us different lists and things I
 
03:38:11.229 --> 03:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
just want to go back to one of the other
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
ones that that came out when you handed
 
03:38:15.550 --> 03:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
out the excuse me when you handed out
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
out the information uh to was a couple
 
03:38:20.349 --> 03:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
days ago and that is that there were
 
03:38:21.910 --> 03:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
several projects on here I'm trying to
 
03:38:24.550 --> 03:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
find them on your final list of
 
03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
amendments or recom or
 
03:38:29.670 --> 03:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations and of course um first
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
thing I was going to ask you about was
 
03:38:34.189 --> 03:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
the was on page 30 uh is the Hampton
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
Branch rail trail it says various that
 
03:38:38.870 --> 03:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
means various projects there there's
 
03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
three of them in there now which which
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
you've uh which you already provided but
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
it added a 2 and A5 million to do more
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
work on one section and like 1.5 in
 
03:38:53.309 --> 03:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
another um was that put some other place
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
or did you decide just when you're doing
 
03:38:58.269 --> 03:38:58.279 align:start position:0%
all of the money work that we couldn't
 
03:39:00.910 --> 03:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
do it now add that in now or no so these
 
03:39:03.389 --> 03:39:03.399 align:start position:0%
were changes from the governor's phase
 
03:39:06.269 --> 03:39:06.279 align:start position:0%
so the governor requested these changes
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
what he requested was he removed a lot
 
03:39:11.469 --> 03:39:11.479 align:start position:0%
of the EV projects on the
 
03:39:14.189 --> 03:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
top um of the list so the list is what
 
03:39:16.870 --> 03:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
we handed out last time
 
03:39:19.229 --> 03:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
um there were a number of e EV projects
 
03:39:21.870 --> 03:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to be removed as well as
 
03:39:26.349 --> 03:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
a Portmouth U multi-use path project and
 
03:39:28.710 --> 03:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
what he asked us to do was take that
 
03:39:32.910 --> 03:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
those funds and add um I believe it
 
03:39:34.349 --> 03:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
works out to
 
03:39:34.359 --> 03:39:35.990 align:start position:0%
works out to
be

03:39:35.990 --> 03:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
three2 and A5 million do to the Hampton
 
03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
Branch rail trail projects as a whole so
 
03:39:49.590 --> 03:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's three project s left to right to
 
03:39:51.990 --> 03:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
to do that to do that work and so what
 
03:39:54.429 --> 03:39:54.439 align:start position:0%
we did is we distributed that $25
 
03:39:56.590 --> 03:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
million amongst those three projects
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
some of them were underfunded um and so
 
03:40:02.110 --> 03:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
that's where that money came
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
from follow up please in the book yeah
 
03:40:07.269 --> 03:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
we want to find out so it's added into
 
03:40:10.349 --> 03:40:10.359 align:start position:0%
the book The those figures the 2.5
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
million and then the 600,000 and another
 
03:40:16.389 --> 03:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
1.5 is is now in the book so I believe
 
03:40:18.910 --> 03:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
what we did for that was those projects
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
already existed in the book but if you
 
03:40:23.070 --> 03:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
look in the comments there should be a
 
03:40:25.550 --> 03:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
comment that says there is this much
 
03:40:28.510 --> 03:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
money added in for this project got your
 
03:40:30.070 --> 03:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
book in front of you Mike yeah I got it
 
03:40:33.550 --> 03:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
read here but uh page 195 under
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
CBR yeah on your little blur it says C
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
Brook 42609
 
03:40:43.030 --> 03:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
350k and on page 195 under the comments
 
03:40:45.510 --> 03:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
it says add 350k
 
03:40:47.710 --> 03:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
to cover unfunded costs for the Hampton
 
03:40:49.830 --> 03:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
Beach rail
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
trail Y and so on the Hampton North or
 
03:40:56.790 --> 03:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
Hampton Falls project on page 85 there's
 
03:40:59.070 --> 03:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
a comment that says add 1.5 million to
 
03:41:01.269 --> 03:41:01.279 align:start position:0%
cover unfunded cost for the Hampton
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
Branch rail trail so we added those
 
03:41:07.389 --> 03:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
comments in we didn't have time to
 
03:41:09.309 --> 03:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
really change the numbers but we wanted
 
03:41:13.110 --> 03:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that comment was added and
 
03:41:16.309 --> 03:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
captured and further are you satisfied
 
03:41:18.429 --> 03:41:18.439 align:start position:0%

you um right below that they have is
 
03:42:05.680 --> 03:42:07.189 align:start position:0%
you um right below that they have is
FTA

03:42:07.189 --> 03:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
FTA
 
03:42:12.910 --> 03:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
um five 339 and 5310 and a new project
 
03:42:15.389 --> 03:42:15.399 align:start position:0%
are all of those also in the book they
 
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
should be in the book yes so under the
 
03:42:22.590 --> 03:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
the FTA projects are shown as they're an
 
03:42:26.790 --> 03:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order under FTA
 
03:42:31.229 --> 03:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
5339 I believe no or are they
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
programmatics programmatics in the very
 
03:42:36.269 --> 03:42:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:38.149 --> 03:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
book yeah you don't have to find it
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
right now but you're telling me that
 
03:42:42.189 --> 03:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
those are in the book same exact wording
 
03:42:44.030 --> 03:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I believe as they're shown as
 
03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:45.710 align:start position:0%
um I believe as they're shown as
comments

03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:42:47.670 --> 03:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
okay very good thank you very much uh
 
03:42:50.189 --> 03:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
represent Jack uh so having looked at
 
03:42:52.149 --> 03:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
last year's last time's committee
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment doesn't have anything like
 
03:42:57.590 --> 03:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
this level of detail in it so my current
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of the process is the book
 
03:43:02.510 --> 03:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
continues to be a moving Target up until
 
03:43:04.910 --> 03:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
the time it passes the
 
03:43:07.469 --> 03:43:07.479 align:start position:0%
legislature and we produce the final
 
03:43:09.229 --> 03:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
version of the book the book is a moving
 
03:43:12.030 --> 03:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
Target up until we erase the word Draft
 
03:43:14.189 --> 03:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
when it finally passes the legislature
 
03:43:16.149 --> 03:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
and that and the bill goes to the
 
03:43:17.429 --> 03:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
governor to be
 
03:43:17.439 --> 03:43:20.389 align:start position:0%
governor to be
signed

03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
signed
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
correct okay any further
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions oh I'm I apologize uh R
 
03:43:30.149 --> 03:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
Newman I don't know if it would be
 
03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
helpful or to labor intensive but
 
03:43:35.590 --> 03:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
following on what representative Edgar's
 
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh questions were would it be useful for
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
the whole bunch of us to know what page
 
03:43:43.950 --> 03:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
these things are on um I don't know if
 
03:43:45.990 --> 03:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's an easy because you all know
 
03:43:48.590 --> 03:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
where they go right away I don't know if
 
03:43:50.590 --> 03:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
people are interested in can look them
 
03:43:53.110 --> 03:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
up after I I appreciate the question but
 
03:43:56.070 --> 03:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
I I think it was more specific to uh
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
remar's project and I from going through
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
that level of detail I feel well assured
 
03:44:04.309 --> 03:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
that those those changes have been made
 
03:44:04.319 --> 03:44:09.950 align:start position:0%
that those those changes have been made
in

03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
questions okay so that that takes care
 
03:44:18.429 --> 03:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
of that takes care of the Department's
 
03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
requests the changes that need to be
 
03:44:24.030 --> 03:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
done the
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
um no questions okay so I I have two two
 
03:44:31.950 --> 03:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
other items to discuss um and I
 
03:44:37.389 --> 03:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:48.830 --> 03:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:50.790 --> 03:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
um what I'm offering is an
 
03:44:50.800 --> 03:44:52.590 align:start position:0%
um what I'm offering is an
amendment

03:44:52.590 --> 03:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:44:55.950 --> 03:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
and what it basically has to do is the
 
03:44:58.950 --> 03:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance of Continental Boulevard in
 
03:45:02.269 --> 03:45:02.279 align:start position:0%
maraman and what the Amendment states is
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Transportation
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
shall not be responsible for
 
03:45:09.510 --> 03:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
maintainance of Continental Boulevard in
 
03:45:10.590 --> 03:45:10.600 align:start position:0%
the town of
 
03:45:14.110 --> 03:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
marac and the effective date shall be it
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
will take effect on July 1st
 
03:45:20.950 --> 03:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
2026 the reason for this amendment is
 
03:45:24.349 --> 03:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
even though this is a Town Road the
 
03:45:26.630 --> 03:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation has been
 
03:45:29.149 --> 03:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintenance of
 
03:45:29.159 --> 03:45:30.469 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintenance of
Continental

03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
Continental
 
03:45:36.269 --> 03:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
Boulevard at a cost of um $80,000 a year
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
and that does not include any new
 
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the amount of salt to be
 
03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
used for for snow clearing and the last
 
03:45:51.710 --> 03:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
time time um that the Continental
 
03:45:56.590 --> 03:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
Boulevard was repaved repaved was in
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
2017 so it's about due um
 
03:46:04.429 --> 03:46:04.439 align:start position:0%
2025 I the math is
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
right and the cost of of the Lost of
 
03:46:13.630 --> 03:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
revenue from elimination of the toll WS
 
03:46:19.830 --> 03:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
at exits 12 11 and 10 is $1.7
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
million uh to the uh Turnpike system and
 
03:46:28.950 --> 03:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
the cost to remove the three toll booths
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
is 1.9 million that's what it costs to
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
take them
 
03:46:37.950 --> 03:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
out to cost to full remove fully remove
 
03:46:41.630 --> 03:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
remnants of ramp to tunnels building
 
03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
demolition ramp
 
03:46:46.309 --> 03:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
reconstruction is $4
 
03:46:50.030 --> 03:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
million um so I think if this is going
 
03:46:54.990 --> 03:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
to be a road in the town of miramac and
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
the town is going to receive the um
 
03:47:05.309 --> 03:47:05.319 align:start position:0%
um the uh benefits of the business the
 
03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
property tax on the business located
 
03:47:10.349 --> 03:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
along Continental Boulevard that they
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
should be responsible for the
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
maintainance of this road
 
03:47:18.309 --> 03:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
um and I can't think of any other
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
examples that we have where the doot is
 
03:47:25.630 --> 03:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for the maintenance of town
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:33.550 --> 03:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative um questions questions of
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
or so for some some background for
 
03:47:45.960 --> 03:47:46.870 align:start position:0%
or so for some some background for
committee

03:47:46.870 --> 03:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
members um history lesson history lesson
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
and um and I'll take uh further after my
 
03:47:58.189 --> 03:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.189 --> 03:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
had nearly all the 20 years I've been
 
03:48:04.030 --> 03:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
around since 2002 there's always maych
 
03:48:05.790 --> 03:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
had always had a
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
conversation about wanting to remove
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
tolls but um
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
it and it was
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
to FL back up they there were
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
improvements that were needed to be made
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
to the turnpike system and to make those
 
03:48:25.189 --> 03:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
improvements it would involve
 
03:48:27.710 --> 03:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
tolling um for
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
that and it was under those terms the
 
03:48:34.349 --> 03:48:34.359 align:start position:0%
legislature appropriated the money and
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
the roads were
 
03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
built there was a constant effort after
 
03:48:41.950 --> 03:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
that time that from I don't know whether
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
it would be the town of marac or
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns it they're that the
 
03:48:49.710 --> 03:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
fee to build that should have been paid
 
03:48:52.590 --> 03:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
back and that it was a burden now to
 
03:48:52.600 --> 03:48:53.389 align:start position:0%
back and that it was a burden now to
their

03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:48:53.399 --> 03:48:54.990 align:start position:0%
their
town

03:48:54.990 --> 03:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:49:00.189 --> 03:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
the the um and M representative Abbott
 
03:49:02.189 --> 03:49:02.199 align:start position:0%
has highlighted some of some of the
 
03:49:04.990 --> 03:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
items of the cost that it it cost a
 
03:49:07.710 --> 03:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system between revenue of what
 
03:49:11.710 --> 03:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
those uh tolls were and um you know
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
nearly $4 million in the end to remove
 
03:49:16.870 --> 03:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
all of that that it left us with a
 
03:49:19.070 --> 03:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
section of road which was Continental
 
03:49:21.550 --> 03:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
Boulevard that we said when when all of
 
03:49:24.309 --> 03:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
this was done it was the position I
 
03:49:27.630 --> 03:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
believe of the department and and and we
 
03:49:32.229 --> 03:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
confirmed it as as a position a policy
 
03:49:35.790 --> 03:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
out of this committee that we were no
 
03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
longer going to pay for the maintenance
 
03:49:41.229 --> 03:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
we had already paid to resurface it and
 
03:49:44.870 --> 03:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
it left here as not being part of the 10
 
03:49:48.309 --> 03:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
plan was being removed but at some time
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
during the process of two years ago
 
03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference um it came back
 
03:49:57.790 --> 03:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
in and I believe the intent of this is
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
to pull it back out again do you want to
 
03:50:04.469 --> 03:50:04.479 align:start position:0%
add more to that um no other than let R
 
03:50:06.269 --> 03:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
and Mills go first actually even
 
03:50:10.110 --> 03:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
predating the the 20e mark the the tolls
 
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
and everything was built at the request
 
03:50:16.870 --> 03:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
of the of marac they had they had
 
03:50:20.070 --> 03:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
digital equipment coming
 
03:50:22.750 --> 03:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
in okay thank you I'm being I'm being
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
corrected to put my microphone on they
 
03:50:27.149 --> 03:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
had the digital equipment coming back in
 
03:50:29.790 --> 03:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
and in order to accommodate all the
 
03:50:32.870 --> 03:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
traffic going to that way uh and this
 
03:50:37.349 --> 03:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
used to be this used to be a a a
 
03:50:40.269 --> 03:50:40.279 align:start position:0%
practice for all new for all new uh
 
03:50:42.110 --> 03:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
Representatives come in when when you
 
03:50:44.229 --> 03:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
went to your first day of practice on on
 
03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
on build bills and things this used to
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
be something that was argued because it
 
03:50:50.830 --> 03:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
it had been so historic there were the
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
the town had approached the town
 
03:50:57.510 --> 03:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
managers the police everybody begged the
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislature to put in these ex extend
 
03:51:05.309 --> 03:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
the uh Turnpike to it so they did and uh
 
03:51:09.309 --> 03:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
put in the tolls and everything went
 
03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
fairly normal up until digital shut down
 
03:51:14.590 --> 03:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
there and at that point in time the town
 
03:51:14.600 --> 03:51:16.149 align:start position:0%
there and at that point in time the town
felt

03:51:16.149 --> 03:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
felt
 
03:51:18.429 --> 03:51:18.439 align:start position:0%
that they had paid enough that they'
 
03:51:19.950 --> 03:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
paid the bond and everything else and
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
wanted all the tolls removed as part of
 
03:51:24.510 --> 03:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
that original agreement when Continental
 
03:51:27.429 --> 03:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
Boulevard was in there the state had and
 
03:51:29.149 --> 03:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
just where you guys can correct me the
 
03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
state had put in salt sheds the state
 
03:51:34.710 --> 03:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
had put in a little mini um what what
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
whatever you call it a maintenance yard
 
03:51:39.070 --> 03:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
or something like that and agreed to
 
03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
maintain Continental
 
03:51:43.550 --> 03:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
Boulevard when when all the tolls went
 
03:51:45.870 --> 03:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
away and they asked everything to be
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
removed this committee attempted to give
 
03:51:51.429 --> 03:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
the town back Continental Boulevard and
 
03:51:53.750 --> 03:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh we were
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
in agreement to do that and it and it
 
03:51:58.710 --> 03:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
did get overturned at a at a higher
 
03:52:02.309 --> 03:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
level so that's my background with itcl
 
03:52:03.790 --> 03:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I've been on
 
03:52:05.590 --> 03:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
this committee basically all but one
 
03:52:08.590 --> 03:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
term since 1992 and when I first came to
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
the very first year there was a bill in
 
03:52:13.389 --> 03:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
put by the marac representatives to deal
 
03:52:15.149 --> 03:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
to remove all the
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
tolls and uh so they solve the problem
 
03:52:20.070 --> 03:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
the problem is it was pointed out if we
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
removed all the polls there'd be at
 
03:52:26.070 --> 03:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
least a a a 10 a 10 cent hike in the gas
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
tax to pay for removal of the tolls but
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
they've been consistent and and I was
 
03:52:32.990 --> 03:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
I've seen documentation it was before I
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
came to the committee in the late 80s
 
03:52:36.229 --> 03:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
that the town of at least the town of
 
03:52:39.189 --> 03:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
Mer their leaders were willing to pay
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
for the exit ramp tolls and I'm I'm I I
 
03:52:44.710 --> 03:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
guess it's a controversial issue but in
 
03:52:48.070 --> 03:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
the documentation the town leaders
 
03:52:50.149 --> 03:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
wanted were willing to have the
 
03:52:54.070 --> 03:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
residents pay uh for the improvements to
 
03:52:56.750 --> 03:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
attract digital equipment at the time by
 
03:52:59.910 --> 03:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
installing these uh uh I'm sorry ramp
 
03:53:02.189 --> 03:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
TOS so it's been a constant issue and it
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
was you know ever since the 90s it uh
 
03:53:08.469 --> 03:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
has come before our committee and the in
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
N 2014 as part of a deal to raise the
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
gas tax uh then chairman Campbell worked
 
03:53:16.950 --> 03:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
with then Senate President Peter bragon
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
who represented March I believe and they
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
removed one of the tolls um and then I
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
think this the rest one of them was when
 
03:53:29.070 --> 03:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
I was Sher uh then go then oh excuse me
 
03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
Governor sonunu working with the late
 
03:53:33.790 --> 03:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
dick hinch and then executive counselor
 
03:53:36.309 --> 03:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
Deb pnck heli cut a deal which I wasn't
 
03:53:37.750 --> 03:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
informed about until after it was
 
03:53:39.830 --> 03:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
publicly announced and John Graham who's
 
03:53:42.070 --> 03:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
the ranking Republican wasn't too happy
 
03:53:43.750 --> 03:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
we weren't even inform formed I would
 
03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
have loved to gone on to that council
 
03:53:46.670 --> 03:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
meeting and I would have probably at
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
least spoken my mind probably wouldn't
 
03:53:52.070 --> 03:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
have won but it was approved on a 4 to1
 
03:53:55.269 --> 03:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
vote uh you know with only one counselor
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
my counselor then Mike cryan's
 
03:53:59.189 --> 03:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
supporting it but it's not real partisan
 
03:54:00.990 --> 03:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
issue I understand if you live in marac
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
you're probably in favor of eliminating
 
03:54:07.870 --> 03:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
the tolls but I I have to balance it the
 
03:54:11.110 --> 03:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
public you know between uh between the
 
03:54:13.750 --> 03:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
obligations of the town of marac and the
 
03:54:15.429 --> 03:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
state and I I don't know I think it's
 
03:54:17.070 --> 03:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable to turn it back to town
 
03:54:18.710 --> 03:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
because we've eliminated I believe all
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
the tolls now so the town of marac they
 
03:54:24.070 --> 03:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
should be very happy for that but that's
 
03:54:25.870 --> 03:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion thank
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
comment yes please representative well
 
03:54:34.830 --> 03:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman since I am the
 
03:54:36.630 --> 03:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
evil redheaded stepchild sitting over
 
03:54:38.590 --> 03:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
here from Mar I would not say
 
03:54:41.670 --> 03:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
that representative I apologize for the
 
03:54:46.149 --> 03:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
clarification but um
 
03:54:48.309 --> 03:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
two years ago I was the only person that
 
03:54:50.349 --> 03:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
that that did vote that did vote against
 
03:54:52.870 --> 03:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
this and I gave the speech on the floor
 
03:54:54.389 --> 03:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
against and I still stand by the
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
argument you know Exit 12 was removed
 
03:55:00.149 --> 03:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
and the what was given back was a four
 
03:55:02.990 --> 03:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
increase in the gas tax so there was
 
03:55:04.269 --> 03:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
there was some trade-off the removal of
 
03:55:06.269 --> 03:55:06.279 align:start position:0%
the tolls got a got a 4 Cent bump on the
 
03:55:08.750 --> 03:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
gas tax that's number one number two we
 
03:55:12.070 --> 03:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
were able to document that Exit 11 was
 
03:55:14.950 --> 03:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
Was Not only was not only
 
03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
pay you know paid off it was actually
 
03:55:19.349 --> 03:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
costing the dot they were paying more
 
03:55:22.590 --> 03:55:22.600 align:start position:0%
money out in maintenance to manage Exit
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
11 than what it was actually bringing in
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
so so the the foundation behind those
 
03:55:30.830 --> 03:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
two the removal of two two of those
 
03:55:32.870 --> 03:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
particular toll boots combined with the
 
03:55:34.429 --> 03:55:34.439 align:start position:0%
fact that we were able to show that the
 
03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
bonds were paid off at the time
 
03:55:38.030 --> 03:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
Justified the removal of those
 
03:55:40.590 --> 03:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
particular tolls so that's the other
 
03:55:43.710 --> 03:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
thing the the third thing is the way
 
03:55:46.229 --> 03:55:46.239 align:start position:0%
that the way that I read the amendment
 
03:55:49.070 --> 03:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
is is you're beaking the town of road
 
03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
that we have absolutely no idea what
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
condition the road is in we're getting
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
the road as is so conceivably something
 
03:55:58.189 --> 03:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
could happen within the next within a
 
03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
year or two that would require an
 
03:56:02.910 --> 03:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
additional cost for the town to absorb
 
03:56:05.550 --> 03:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to dig up and repair what
 
03:56:07.469 --> 03:56:07.479 align:start position:0%
needs to be done to whatever to whatever
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done to that particular
 
03:56:12.510 --> 03:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
stretch of roadway so accepting
 
03:56:15.389 --> 03:56:15.399 align:start position:0%
something Prima fascia as is just
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't sit with me and then the last
 
03:56:20.189 --> 03:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
thing that I would point out is you know
 
03:56:21.269 --> 03:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
the road
 
03:56:25.469 --> 03:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
does does nashwa and pelum and Hudson a
 
03:56:28.910 --> 03:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
tremendous favor by by gearing any any
 
03:56:31.469 --> 03:56:31.479 align:start position:0%
traffic driving westbound that wants to
 
03:56:33.389 --> 03:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
go north they're avoiding exit they're
 
03:56:35.309 --> 03:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
avoiding exit hate because now they can
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
go north on Continental Boulevard and
 
03:56:39.550 --> 03:56:39.560 align:start position:0%
they can utilize Exit 11 to be able to
 
03:56:42.189 --> 03:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
travel North it's that it's that simple
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's an ancillary Feld
 
03:56:46.590 --> 03:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
road that provide that provides a Regal
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
artery to people that live in the
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
Southern and West excuse me southern and
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
western part of of Hillsboro County that
 
03:56:57.070 --> 03:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
are looking to go north onto 93 so
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
because of the regional perspective that
 
03:57:01.550 --> 03:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
the road Prov provides provides should
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
should require a higher level of care
 
03:57:05.309 --> 03:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
and maintenance that the state has been
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
able to provide for a certain period of
 
03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
time so this there's the regional
 
03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
balance that the road brings so those
 
03:57:13.910 --> 03:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
are the reasons why you know and and I
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
app appreciate my my good friend from
 
03:57:18.030 --> 03:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
cheser County I really do um but those
 
03:57:20.189 --> 03:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
are the reasons why I I disagree with
 
03:57:23.309 --> 03:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment because you it's it's
 
03:57:26.030 --> 03:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's ping a road upon a town that
 
03:57:28.389 --> 03:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
has no idea has no idea with what
 
03:57:31.149 --> 03:57:31.159 align:start position:0%
they're getting and in anecdotally tell
 
03:57:32.870 --> 03:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
you right now that the town fathers if
 
03:57:35.670 --> 03:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
they got it they'll close it they pretty
 
03:57:37.149 --> 03:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
much have said to me if we get it we'll
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
close it and I'm not sure that that's
 
03:57:40.590 --> 03:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
do the S the Southern Tier of Hillsboro
 
03:57:46.349 --> 03:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
County in any favor by clo closing a
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
major roadway that not that not just
 
03:57:50.229 --> 03:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
feeds the northern part of New Hampshire
 
03:57:53.070 --> 03:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
probably also feeds um Manchester Boston
 
03:57:54.550 --> 03:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
Regional Airport so there's that
 
03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
particular concern to factor in as well
 
03:58:00.030 --> 03:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
so anyway I appreciate the opportunity
 
03:58:02.309 --> 03:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Mr chairman
 
03:58:05.590 --> 03:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
repres CLE uh yes a question and maybe
 
03:58:08.149 --> 03:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
to the department in and I know
 
03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:09.399 align:start position:0%
representative boy just raised some
 
03:58:11.070 --> 03:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
concerns about the condition of the road
 
03:58:13.070 --> 03:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
does the department or has the
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
department inspected the Continental
 
03:58:16.590 --> 03:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
Boulevard lately and if they've
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
inspected what sort of condition is the
 
03:58:22.990 --> 03:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
RO thank you for the question I have no
 
03:58:26.030 --> 03:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
reason to believe that there is anything
 
03:58:28.830 --> 03:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
eminently or immediately wrong with
 
03:58:31.870 --> 03:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
Continental Boulevard that that road is
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
in good shape by um all information that
 
03:58:38.830 --> 03:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
I have okay all right thank thank you
 
03:58:41.630 --> 03:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
and um I guess I guess my question would
 
03:58:44.309 --> 03:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
be if we had a long discussion this
 
03:58:46.070 --> 03:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
morning on um
 
03:58:50.229 --> 03:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
resurfacing of Highways and I believe u
 
03:58:52.149 --> 03:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
i can't remember what year previous that
 
03:58:57.149 --> 03:58:57.159 align:start position:0%
that was resurfaced 2017 perhaps so um
 
03:59:00.429 --> 03:59:00.439 align:start position:0%
it would seem that there is going to be
 
03:59:03.229 --> 03:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
a cost if the state were to continue on
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
of some factor of 1.7 million whatever
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
that might be and it would seem to me
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
that the detriment to the town or
 
03:59:15.070 --> 03:59:15.080 align:start position:0%
whatever form of government is there
 
03:59:18.030 --> 03:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
that to maintain that road they If This
 
03:59:20.670 --> 03:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
Were to pass that would be the cost to
 
03:59:24.070 --> 03:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
keep that road uh that road to the
 
03:59:27.149 --> 03:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
standard it is right
 
03:59:30.990 --> 03:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
now so do I understand you to suggest
 
03:59:34.389 --> 03:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
that as part of this as part of turning
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
Continental Boulevard over to the town
 
03:59:39.110 --> 03:59:39.120 align:start position:0%
that this committee may require the
 
03:59:41.550 --> 03:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
department to resurface the road prior
 
03:59:44.149 --> 03:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
to that thank you for that clar
 
03:59:47.469 --> 03:59:47.479 align:start position:0%
ification my point is no my I I was I
 
03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
was making a u a comment that the road
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
is my understanding of good quality at
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
this point in time and that the state
 
04:00:00.950 --> 04:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
had put a resurfacing on it in
 
04:00:05.229 --> 04:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
2017 my point was only that uh when the
 
04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
good representative had brought the
 
04:00:08.950 --> 04:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
point we don't know what condition this
 
04:00:11.389 --> 04:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
is I would say on the surface that they
 
04:00:13.790 --> 04:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
would have to anticipate to keep it in
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
the level of surface it is at some point
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the number of years they'd have to
 
04:00:20.670 --> 04:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
resurface it where if we were to hold on
 
04:00:22.630 --> 04:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
to this we as the state are going to
 
04:00:24.189 --> 04:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
have to incur that
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
cost that's that's all I agree with that
 
04:00:29.990 --> 04:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:36.670 --> 04:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
generalities my my concern with our
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
continued care of this road is I
 
04:00:42.830 --> 04:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
understand that we have we have other
 
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
lsrs that are coming forward with a
 
04:00:48.990 --> 04:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
displeasure of a water quality
 
04:00:54.149 --> 04:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
issue and asking uh um do if it were to
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
come through here that to uh mandate a
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
lesser amount of salt and and my concern
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
is that this could let's let's say the
 
04:01:07.189 --> 04:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
state were to hold on to this and then
 
04:01:10.469 --> 04:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
we then we have to expend more money to
 
04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
regulate salt
 
04:01:15.990 --> 04:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
content at what point this I
 
04:01:17.950 --> 04:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
guess would you
 
04:01:20.469 --> 04:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
believe that the state could be
 
04:01:22.750 --> 04:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
subjected to more and more mandates
 
04:01:22.760 --> 04:01:23.630 align:start position:0%
subjected to more and more mandates
going

04:01:23.630 --> 04:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:01:26.389 --> 04:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
forward on a road that we
 
04:01:28.830 --> 04:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
own there's no need to answer that and I
 
04:01:30.990 --> 04:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't typically allow that
 
04:01:34.349 --> 04:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
to happen the chairman just went there
 
04:01:38.950 --> 04:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
so um did did would they uh would the
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
department care to weigh in at all on
 
04:01:45.070 --> 04:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:53.469 --> 04:01:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
to i i c I certainly understand the the
 
04:02:01.349 --> 04:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
the the the the committee's position um
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
I think from the Department's
 
04:02:05.070 --> 04:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
perspective we reconciled ourselves to
 
04:02:08.070 --> 04:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
the existing conditions two years ago
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
when when when when when uh a similar
 
04:02:15.469 --> 04:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
amendment was was was Was Defeated
 
04:02:17.630 --> 04:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
so you know with that said you know
 
04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
we're reconciled to to continue
 
04:02:22.269 --> 04:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
maintaining it uh it's it's it's our de
 
04:02:24.229 --> 04:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
facto as part of the system it had been
 
04:02:27.229 --> 04:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
debated previously that said it
 
04:02:29.149 --> 04:02:29.159 align:start position:0%
certainly the Committees and the
 
04:02:31.950 --> 04:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
legislator's uh prerogative all the all
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
the points you made make were points
 
04:02:35.910 --> 04:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
that that that
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
um we tried to make several years ago
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
when um when the um when the when the
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
tolls were eliminated ated
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
so yes repres Bor
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
please not being extremely familiar with
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
this road that y'all are talking about
 
04:02:58.950 --> 04:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
but being on a Town Council uh what
 
04:03:02.389 --> 04:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
benefit does it give marac to take
 
04:03:05.750 --> 04:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
control of the road out of the hands of
 
04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
the state I don't understand what
 
04:03:12.830 --> 04:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
benefit there is there there if I could
 
04:03:15.389 --> 04:03:15.399 align:start position:0%
there there is no benefit for the town
 
04:03:17.870 --> 04:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
to take that over it was our point that
 
04:03:20.510 --> 04:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
it was when we when we
 
04:03:24.870 --> 04:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
relinquished the Turnpike tolls booths
 
04:03:26.870 --> 04:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
and made all the improvements those were
 
04:03:30.510 --> 04:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
all cost being born by the state and it
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
was a position we were going to turn it
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
back to the town and the town or city I
 
04:03:39.750 --> 04:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't the town that um that
 
04:03:41.710 --> 04:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
they had Lobby to a point to reverse
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
that position
 
04:03:47.309 --> 04:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
a followup please pleas
 
04:03:52.990 --> 04:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
so this is an amendment borne by Public
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
Works not necessarily the town and
 
04:03:58.910 --> 04:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
correct so the town could perceive this
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
as an unfriendly amendment to them sure
 
04:04:06.590 --> 04:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:10.030 --> 04:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
yes yes re parner please so my
 
04:04:12.189 --> 04:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
understanding is that we brought this up
 
04:04:14.870 --> 04:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
as an amendment to
 
04:04:17.469 --> 04:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
a petition by the town of marac to
 
04:04:20.830 --> 04:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
reduce or eliminate toll boots so their
 
04:04:22.590 --> 04:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
benefit is that their residents don't
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
pay tolls where they used to and
 
04:04:29.349 --> 04:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
so this was sort of quot quot that they
 
04:04:32.469 --> 04:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
get a benefit pick up some
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility those they did eliminate
 
04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
the tolls but never picked up the the
 
04:04:42.710 --> 04:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
road yes follow up and then I'll come
 
04:04:47.269 --> 04:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
back to I oliz thank you so no no reason
 
04:04:50.149 --> 04:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
to apologize go right ahead sir is this
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
all written in agreement somewhere that
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
if we got rid of the tolls we would turn
 
04:04:58.229 --> 04:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
the road over to them or was this just
 
04:05:01.469 --> 04:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
people talking and presumptions on a lot
 
04:05:03.389 --> 04:05:03.399 align:start position:0%
of different
 
04:05:07.389 --> 04:05:07.399 align:start position:0%
people's thoughts it was the position if
 
04:05:10.149 --> 04:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
I could and please correct me it was a
 
04:05:12.189 --> 04:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
position of this committee that we had
 
04:05:14.309 --> 04:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
done that and that we were that we were
 
04:05:16.910 --> 04:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
relinquishing that section of road back
 
04:05:19.229 --> 04:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
to the town because it was not connected
 
04:05:31.149 --> 04:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
longer first Jack uh thank you Mr
 
04:05:35.309 --> 04:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
chairman uh following up on the history
 
04:05:37.389 --> 04:05:37.399 align:start position:0%
lesson that our clerk provided yes it is
 
04:05:40.590 --> 04:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
true that digital equipment did uh close
 
04:05:42.990 --> 04:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
that facility it wasn't too long after
 
04:05:47.309 --> 04:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
that that Fidelity opened uh a facility
 
04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
at that location and I would assume that
 
04:05:52.750 --> 04:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's still open that it has about I I
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
did work there at the time uh I would
 
04:05:56.910 --> 04:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
assume it has about the same number of
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
employees that it had then which is
 
04:06:01.950 --> 04:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
probably over a thousand uh it surprises
 
04:06:03.950 --> 04:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
me to hear that the town would close a
 
04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
road that is the only access to that
 
04:06:08.550 --> 04:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
plant for over a thousand people I
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:15.790 --> 04:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
itself as an industrial
 
04:06:20.830 --> 04:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
you yes um I would um see there's quite
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
a bit of discussion here I would like to
 
04:06:29.790 --> 04:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
recess for 10 minutes I'm gonna permit
 
04:06:34.149 --> 04:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
the two parties to caucus and my and my
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
thought is to come back straw pull this
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
and other amendments and so that we can
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
depending on how we go we will then uh
 
04:06:46.030 --> 04:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
send it in working with the
 
04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
Department uh to um to have the final
 
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
draft done and um so why don't we do
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%

04:26:35.189 --> 04:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I apologize
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
that the answer is some place but what
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
if with these amendments what's the
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
bottom line how much money how much
 
04:26:43.269 --> 04:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
money are we spending on the 10year plan
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
addition well no I see that $55 million
 
04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's on this with the what is the bottom
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
line on on the 10e plan would the
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
department know that isn't in the
 
04:26:56.950 --> 04:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of$ 225 $250 million
 
04:27:00.309 --> 04:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
total five billion for
 
04:27:05.910 --> 04:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
10 per year so it's it's a billion
 
04:27:08.590 --> 04:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
dollars over the next two
 
04:27:11.550 --> 04:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
years then then then this it's that 55
 
04:27:13.830 --> 04:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 50 5 million on top of that
 
04:27:15.830 --> 04:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
500 million so it's about 10%

04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%

04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
amendment Mr chair excuse
 
04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
me rev
 
04:30:16.030 --> 04:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
pner my only concern I
 
04:30:18.510 --> 04:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
certainly approve of the sentiment the
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
the idea behind it my only concern is
 
04:30:24.030 --> 04:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
whether this is going to generate u a
 
04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
floor fight on something that otherwise
 
04:30:28.910 --> 04:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
would be a pretty clean clean bill and
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
whether that's something that we uh are
 
04:30:33.309 --> 04:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
prepared to
 
04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:40.590 --> 04:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
question and I thank you for the comment
 
04:30:42.149 --> 04:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
and the comments been brought up by
 
04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
other Representatives
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
also uh to myself it's a fairness issue
 
04:30:50.590 --> 04:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
and it it's been and if that turns out
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
to be the case and we were to be a
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
majority vote here or even a stronger
 
04:30:58.269 --> 04:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
vote than that then that would be the
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
hill I would climb for this
 
04:31:03.550 --> 04:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
committee further
 
04:31:06.149 --> 04:31:06.159 align:start position:0%

04:31:11.189 --> 04:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
discuss the whole thing maybe a change
 
04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
to this or amendment to Amendment okay
 
04:31:15.070 --> 04:31:15.080 align:start position:0%

discussion if you're in favor draw a
 
04:31:36.269 --> 04:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
poll again of including this amendment
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
into the 10-year plan signify by raising
 
04:31:43.710 --> 04:31:43.720 align:start position:0%

seconds ago I would raise it even higher
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
if we would uh consider um possibly uh
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
turning over the
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%

04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
future amendment that You' like
 
04:32:36.870 --> 04:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
considered would be that we would stay
 
04:32:39.590 --> 04:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
with the committee position of um
 
04:32:41.710 --> 04:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
turning turning the road back over to
 
04:32:44.870 --> 04:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
the the town but you saying in doing so
 
04:32:47.109 --> 04:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
only after the state had completed a
 
04:32:49.950 --> 04:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
repaving of that of that
 
04:32:54.189 --> 04:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
road uh yes Mr chairman by by
 
04:32:54.199 --> 04:33:00.670 align:start position:0%
road uh yes Mr chairman by by
2026

04:33:00.670 --> 04:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.269 --> 04:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
okay let's see let's see what the
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
U favor of the committee is does
 
04:33:08.830 --> 04:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
everyone understand the possible
 
04:33:10.269 --> 04:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
04:33:12.830 --> 04:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
this that we would still be turning it
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
over but uh the suggestion is that we
 
04:33:18.830 --> 04:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't turn it over until the uh until
 
04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:21.561 align:start position:0%
the department had repave the road one
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
that yes the question would be is the
 
04:33:36.470 --> 04:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
money already
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
funded for this or this new money to be
 
04:33:40.400 --> 04:33:43.990 align:start position:0%
funded for this or this new money to be
added

would you care to answer
 
04:33:49.510 --> 04:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
that I I'll ask a question of to try to
 
04:33:52.590 --> 04:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
answer thank you Mr chairman and that is
 
04:33:54.990 --> 04:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
i' would like to ask if in fact that by
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
2026 that money would already be
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
included in some of the 10-year plan
 
04:34:02.590 --> 04:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
projects that are shown seeing we're
 
04:34:04.990 --> 04:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
told that about every eight years or so
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
we we repay that it this would be on the
 
04:34:16.750 --> 04:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:20.789 --> 04:34:20.799 align:start position:0%
so this would be a Turnpike funded
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
expenditure and the Turnpike does have
 
04:34:27.670 --> 04:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
an annual Paving program um so if we had
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
to work this this section in we could
 
04:34:34.629 --> 04:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
work it in it may come at the expense of
 
04:34:37.789 --> 04:34:37.799 align:start position:0%
the mainline on the the turnpike that
 
04:34:42.750 --> 04:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you uh RAM
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
Newman yes by um uh mandating I guess
 
04:34:52.629 --> 04:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better word that It Be
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
repaved by
 
04:34:58.510 --> 04:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
2026 is that is that something that
 
04:35:01.390 --> 04:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
everybody could guarantee I mean what if
 
04:35:03.789 --> 04:35:03.799 align:start position:0%
there I don't know if things had to be
 
04:35:07.070 --> 04:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
um pushed off a year or two or whatever
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
due to scheduling weather whatever does
 
04:35:12.551 --> 04:35:12.561 align:start position:0%
that blow up the whole thing if you tie
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
in a date
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
certain I I I would answer I I don't
 
04:35:20.109 --> 04:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that and we would ask
 
04:35:24.990 --> 04:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
that question my issue with that
 
04:35:25.000 --> 04:35:26.789 align:start position:0%
that question my issue with that
is

04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
if I I think it's cleaner to say we
 
04:35:33.629 --> 04:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
continue or we stop if if we were to say
 
04:35:36.109 --> 04:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
that we were and this is my this is only
 
04:35:38.429 --> 04:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
my opinion I'm opening it for
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
discussion if year 2026
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
conditions of of before before the
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
pavement could be resurfaced there was
 
04:35:50.429 --> 04:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
even more work that was needed to bring
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
the road in compliance or rather more
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance that needed to be done then
 
04:35:58.390 --> 04:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
I think it would be easy enough for the
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
city to argue that that work should also
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
be included into it so I'm I'm afraid if
 
04:36:08.310 --> 04:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
we were to amend it to
 
04:36:10.310 --> 04:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
resurfacing by
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
2026 and we know that it was 1.6 million
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
when we did it in
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
2017 that we know that in today's
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
dollars it's going to be well over $2
 
04:36:23.789 --> 04:36:23.799 align:start position:0%
million I'm afraid what else would have
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
to be done to that road before we could
 
04:36:29.551 --> 04:36:29.561 align:start position:0%
resurface it so I'm I'm at the pleasure
 
04:36:32.230 --> 04:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
of this committee but I I won't be uh
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
voting for that we're either going to do
 
04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
so if you're favor of drafting another
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee amendment that would uh would
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
change the uh Abid amendment that was
 
04:36:54.990 --> 04:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
brought forward uh to uh now say that
 
04:36:57.390 --> 04:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
the department would
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
resurface um the length of this road uh
 
04:37:03.230 --> 04:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
no later than
 
04:37:06.750 --> 04:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
2026 if you're in favor of that raise
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
two three four okay and if you're
 
04:37:17.199 --> 04:37:20.551 align:start position:0%
two three four okay and if you're
opposed

04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:20.561 --> 04:37:22.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:37:22.109 --> 04:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
so did we take a count on the other way
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
there were three votes I think in favor
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
of Mike Ed amendment I
 
04:37:34.429 --> 04:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
okay four okay I think it's four okay
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
still de 12
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:47.551 --> 04:37:47.561 align:start position:0%
so um so we we have we have Direction on
 
04:37:50.189 --> 04:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
the straw pole for that and we'll we'll
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
draft with this this is all subject to
 
04:37:54.629 --> 04:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
the final
 
04:37:58.470 --> 04:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
vote uh the last is I propose putting an
 
04:38:02.709 --> 04:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
amendment um which uh discusses the um
 
04:38:06.150 --> 04:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
title Salvage rail to offset Trail
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
construction and um there was a bill
 
04:38:11.551 --> 04:38:11.561 align:start position:0%
through this committee and there was
 
04:38:13.470 --> 04:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
discussion through this
 
04:38:18.029 --> 04:38:18.039 align:start position:0%
today that the department has a position
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
presently that if rail is removed when
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
trails are being built that that um that
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
that rail remains in the possession of
 
04:38:29.119 --> 04:38:30.670 align:start position:0%
that rail remains in the possession of
the

04:38:30.670 --> 04:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
department um my proposal is that any
 
04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
and all rail removed from the rail uh
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
specific from Center Osby moltonville
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
road to Silver Lake
 
04:38:44.910 --> 04:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
1341 which is what the bill we brought
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
through forward shall be salvaged either
 
04:38:50.830 --> 04:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
as relay rail or steel Sal for it steel
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
salvage value the revenue generated
 
04:38:58.590 --> 04:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
shall be re be used to remove the rail
 
04:39:00.750 --> 04:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
in the corridor for trail
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
construction the department my
 
04:39:05.109 --> 04:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
understanding has a policy that covers
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
all of the rail that they are in
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
possession of this is this is a half of
 
04:39:11.439 --> 04:39:12.869 align:start position:0%
possession of this is this is a half of
Corridor

04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
Corridor
 
04:39:16.470 --> 04:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
19 uh that's the uh excuse me it's the a
 
04:39:19.470 --> 04:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
it's the Conway Branch the trail
 
04:39:22.189 --> 04:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
division calls it Corridor
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
19 it is only 10 10 miles of that and it
 
04:39:29.109 --> 04:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
would only affect that that section of
 
04:39:32.429 --> 04:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
of rail is owned by the state of New
 
04:39:35.429 --> 04:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we took possession of it and
 
04:39:37.390 --> 04:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
in the event in the future that rail
 
04:39:41.390 --> 04:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
would ever come back that the state
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
would relinquish that property if a ra
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
if a trail was built on it the trail
 
04:39:49.230 --> 04:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
would extinguish and be gone because
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
there is no right of way connected with
 
04:39:55.830 --> 04:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
it so um it's a
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
proposal and I look it more as a pilot
 
04:40:01.030 --> 04:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
project does it work for the department
 
04:40:03.788 --> 04:40:03.798 align:start position:0%
or not but it just says if this project
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
moves forward that that salvage value
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
can be used and it's our understanding
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
that that rail does not have
 
04:40:15.070 --> 04:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
um value for transported Freight at this
 
04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
time yes suggest that not just talk
 
04:40:22.670 --> 04:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
about the rail but Rail and other you
 
04:40:24.590 --> 04:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
know tie plates
 
04:40:28.150 --> 04:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
Fasteners switches signals I I would
 
04:40:31.510 --> 04:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
imagine signals and that sort of word we
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
could add that would include all of that
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
but I will I'll consider that if that's
 
04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
what thought is yeah any further
 
04:40:39.480 --> 04:40:42.270 align:start position:0%
what thought is yeah any further
questions

04:40:42.270 --> 04:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:40:42.280 --> 04:40:43.350 align:start position:0%
questions
yes

04:40:43.350 --> 04:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:40:43.360 --> 04:40:44.948 align:start position:0%
yes
please

04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
Russ who would take possession of the
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
money from the
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
Salvage it it the the intent is that
 
04:40:55.670 --> 04:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
that there there would have to be a
 
04:40:57.910 --> 04:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
group that would be formed to to
 
04:40:59.590 --> 04:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
construct the rail
 
04:41:03.150 --> 04:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
trail and they the money would be to
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
remove the rail and if there was more
 
04:41:07.150 --> 04:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
money than that I I don't know that
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
there would be more money oh so that's
 
04:41:11.788 --> 04:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
like a private organization or yes it
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
something Incorporated through the
 
04:41:17.990 --> 04:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
questions so if um if you are in favor
 
04:41:24.868 --> 04:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
of the amendment um to be written which
 
04:41:26.910 --> 04:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
would be included in here which would
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
only be for this one section of rail 10
 
04:41:33.708 --> 04:41:33.718 align:start position:0%
miles uh signify a raising your
 
04:41:36.030 --> 04:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
hand and if you're
 
04:41:39.628 --> 04:41:39.638 align:start position:0%
opposed carries your Nas so we will
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
will'll draft I will work with the
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
department and draft one Amendment and
 
04:41:46.510 --> 04:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
if we're fortunate enough to have this
 
04:41:48.350 --> 04:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
all pulled together by
 
04:41:51.868 --> 04:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
Friday um we will have that discussion
 
04:41:54.150 --> 04:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't if it can't come
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
together that quickly it's not my intent
 
04:41:58.830 --> 04:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
to bring this committee back next week
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
when the when we're it would be the
 
04:42:00.958 --> 04:42:02.390 align:start position:0%
when the when we're it would be the
following

04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
following
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
week okay any further B yes rep Jack uh
 
04:42:08.670 --> 04:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
scheduling question if as is predicted
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
we go very very late tomorrow would we
 
04:42:17.910 --> 04:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:20.230 --> 04:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
morning we we're on we're on the
 
04:42:23.628 --> 04:42:23.638 align:start position:0%
schedule at this point so I would we
 
04:42:26.270 --> 04:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
look at if the amendment is would we
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
look at answer Friday literally that's
 
04:42:32.910 --> 04:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
all we be doing on right it's voting on
 
04:42:35.550 --> 04:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
amends we could uh we could we could
 
04:42:36.910 --> 04:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
make that announcement on the floor
 
04:42:39.030 --> 04:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
because it's already in the calendar so
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
I think I think we could make the
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
announcement on the
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
floor tomorrow representative Jack in
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
the event that we and as represent Mill
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
says if the amendment's not ready then
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
we could do
 
04:42:54.310 --> 04:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
that um and then push off
 
04:42:59.230 --> 04:42:59.240 align:start position:0%

04:43:01.628 --> 04:43:01.638 align:start position:0%
