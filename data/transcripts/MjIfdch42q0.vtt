well i like to look for third
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
options therefore we will be adjourning

this afternoon no later than 3 15
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%

made it to the senate due to the state
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal note included in the bill that
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
shows an interminable indeterminable
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
increase in revenue due to increasing
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
applications to the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.910 align:start position:0%
applications to the therapeutic cannabis
program

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
with that i will take any questions but
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
there will be expert testimony this
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
morning and technical questions that may
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
be better answered by others who came to
 
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.150 align:start position:0%
be better answered by others who came to
speak

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
i do want to mention about the last
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
year's bill that it was approved by the
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
um the municipal board and um that bill
 
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.550 align:start position:0%
um the municipal board and um that bill
unfortunately

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
died when it was tabled in the senate
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
probably due to the coveted crisis
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
um so with that thank you mr chair and
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee please support this
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill as it is today with the motion of
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and please consider
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
anything that's to come forth
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
as i wrap up my presentation thank you
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative vale and uh
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
since uh representative kenner from our
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
own committee uh serves on the board
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
and is probably the one of the ones
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
you're referring to who will bring
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
additional expert information i'm going
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
to call on him next and then give the
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee a chance to question either
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
you or representative knurk
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
or both
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
so representative conor you're up next
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
there we are
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.079 --> 00:14:40.949 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh yes for the record i'm jerry kanerk
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
representing carroll county district
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
three and um
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
i also serve as the chair of the
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.389 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
board

00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
oversight board also known as tcmob is
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
composed of the chief medical officer of
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
dhhs a qualifying patient representative
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
a clinical representative from an atc
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
and 10 medical providers from various
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
fields we are charged with the task of
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
advising the therapeutic cannabis
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
program on medical issues including
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
qualifying conditions
 
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
as representative fail already noted
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
this bill came forward it was part of hb
 
00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.829 align:start position:0%
this bill came forward it was part of hb
461

00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
461
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
and this the tcmob devoted a great deal
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
of time to considering that condition
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
and some other conditions that were part
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
of that bill and yes it got to the house
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
and uh then just died to cover death
 
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
now the process of evaluating this
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
condition included a public hearing
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
review of the literature regarding
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis use and insomnia
 
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
and a thorough discussion
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
tcmob was very diligent using their
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
personal experience exhaustive
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
literature reviews and testimonials from
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
patients to make their recommendation
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are new to the
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program are new to
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
because we cover their bills the bills
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
that have to do with them qualifying
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
conditions are in rsa 126x
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
they're the conditions for which a
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
patient may be qualified to be certified
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
to use therapeutic cannabis in new
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the qualifying conditions
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
include three standalone conditions or
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
the combination of a qualifying
 
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.550 align:start position:0%
the combination of a qualifying
diagnosis

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
with an associated qualifying symptom
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh tcmob voted nine to one to recommend
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
the addition of moderate to severe
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
insomnia as a qualifying symptom
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm just gonna give you a very
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
brief uh
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
information i did email to everybody our
 
00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
full report that we
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
processed in the end of 2019 because
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
this had been a retained bill from 19
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
and um that goes into a lot more detail
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to give the high points
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
here because that's a big
 
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.509 align:start position:0%
here because that's a big
report

00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
but the majority of studies suggest that
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
use of thc and thc derivatives alone or
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
in combination with cbd may improve
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
self-reported sleep quality
 
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
may decrease sleep disturbances and
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
decrease sleep onset latency that's the
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
amount of time it takes you while you
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
sit and toss and turn and count sheep
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
while you're trying to go to sleep the
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
studies are limited in reaching
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
conclusions but overall point to more
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
beneficial effects than deleterious
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
now uh representative already pointed
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
out some very important issues and that
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
is that there are current
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacological treatments for insomnia
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
or primary sleep disorders are not great
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
they're limited by side effects uh they
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
cause there's there's addiction
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
liability the benefits of some of these
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
prescription sleep medications are
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
really sometimes rather minimal they're
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
approved by the fda but one of them for
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
example only allows you to fall asleep
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
as an average six minutes earlier and
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
only adds a total of 16 minutes of total
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
sleep on average that's not a lot of
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
gain and these minimal improvements
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
often come with increased risk the next
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
day of
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
drowsiness confusion increased traffic
 
00:17:55.029 --> 00:17:55.039 align:start position:0%
accidents hallucinations and sleep
 
00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:56.310 align:start position:0%
accidents hallucinations and sleep
paralysis

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
paralysis
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
now that isn't to imply that the
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids are perfectly risk freaks
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
they are not
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
they are also associated with adverse
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
effects such as dizziness cognitive
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
impairment also increased risk of motor
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle accidents psychosis dependence
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
depression and anxiety so they also do
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
need to be used with caution just
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
because they're natural doesn't mean
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
they're risk-free
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
the point is too that some of the
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
medications current regular
 
00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
medications current regular
pharmacologic

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacologic
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
medications we have to treat insomnia
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
can affect the sleep architecture that's
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
your as you cycle through the various
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
stages and one study demonstrated that
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
cannabinoid preparations may have fewer
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
effects on sleep architecture than the
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
traditional medications
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
the particular preparation and dosing of
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
cannabinoids may be an important factor
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
and more research is actually needed
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
into that
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
bottom line they'll always remember that
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
improving sleep habits and behavioral
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
therapy should be the first line
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
treatments and that works for almost
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
everybody but tcmob does feel that
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis can be a reasonable
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
alternative when those do not suffice
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'm going to pivot for a moment though
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
too because you may have wondered how
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
come i sent off this amendment to this
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill it's not because i thought this
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
bill had a problem
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
it is because
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
we at ccmub has also
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to approve adding autism spectrum
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
disorder as a stand-alone condition
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
and i've sent you that amendment and
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
i've gotten the permission of the
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill to con for us to
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
consider that
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
this is a result of work that tcmob did
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
last year evaluating sb 700 that aimed
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
to add asd as a qual
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
asd autism spectrum disorder as a
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition but it also died a
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
cove of death and
 
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
we were rather surprised when we found
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
out that senator reagan did not file it
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
again and the board agreed it would be
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable for us to offer it as an
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
amendment to hb 89 and also 605 which we
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
hear later
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
we had agreed on voted nine to zero to
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
add asd as a standalone qualifying
 
00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:57.830 align:start position:0%
add asd as a standalone qualifying
condition

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
again the process was lengthy with the
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing review the literature and
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
a thorough discussion there are studies
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
underway looking specifically at the use
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
of therapeutic cannabis and asd but
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
strong evidence is lacking as there is
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
for almost everything in therapeutic
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis and actually for those of you
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
who aren't aware of it sometimes strong
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
evidence is lacking in some of our
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
standard pharmacological interventions
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
as well the testimony to hearing and
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
written testimony provided compelling
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence for the usefulness in
 
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
treating agitation seen in individuals
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
with asd
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
and the desperation of parents
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
and caregivers with such behavior
 
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.950 align:start position:0%
and caregivers with such behavior
now

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
as one person said that was quite
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
eloquent it is one thing when you have a
 
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.390 align:start position:0%
eloquent it is one thing when you have a
nine-year-old

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
nine-year-old
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
with autism having a little hissy fit on
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
the floor in the in the grocery store
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
it's another thing when they're 25.
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
so that can be a really important thing
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
and this particular person found that a
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
very minimal five milligrams of thc a
 
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.310 align:start position:0%
very minimal five milligrams of thc a
day

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
really calmed him down he was able to
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
function and even became i think if i
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
remember right mildly verbal which he
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
had not been not a miracle drug that's
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
not the issue but it really worked well
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
for him and other meds didn't work well
 
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
we did have some patients who had a
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
negative outcome so it does require some
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
close monitoring
 
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
we do know particularly that there are
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
deleterious effects of cannabis on the
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
developing brain and that makes the use
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
of therapeutic cannabis in young
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
patients really concerning
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
so given those considerations
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
we recommended the addition of autism
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
spectrum disorder as a standalone for
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
those over 21 but with rather severe uh
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
specific safeguards to those under 21.
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
we added that
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
we voted to add the requirement of an
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation of a provider or child or
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
adolescent psychiatry or pediatric
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
neurology who confirms that asd has not
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
responded to previously prescribed
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
medications or that other treatment
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
options produced serious side effects
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
and they support certification for the
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
use of the therapeutic cannabis so as
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
chair of the board and their leg
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison and with the
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
concurrence of dhh
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
staff i brought forth this amendment now
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
there's one slight substantive
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
difference over what we actually voted
 
00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:07.669 align:start position:0%
difference over what we actually voted
on

00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
when we processed this later we realized
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
we could add developmental pediatricians
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
as a provider specialist who can provide
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
the required consultation for those
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
under 21 and we did that to improve
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
provider access given the paucity of the
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
other two types of providers in our
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
state so all three of those are people
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
who can serve as that second
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
opinion if you will that this indeed is
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable so in summary
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
oversight board has strongly agreed and
 
00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.350 align:start position:0%
oversight board has strongly agreed and
recommended

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
the underlying portion of this bill
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
which is very moderate to severe
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
insomnia it would like us to also
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
consider adding autism spectrum disorder
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
as an amendment
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
that's all i have thank you
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
before we go any further
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%

representative webber only for the
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%

point thank you mr chairman and i am

home in concord

i have a friend staying who may be in
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
and out but she's not presently in the

room and is not going to spend any great
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
deal of time in the room with me
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i have a
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
clarification question for
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative canark actually i have
 
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.669 align:start position:0%
representative canark actually i have
two

00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
um i just sent up to house committee
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
services because i do not have a copy of
 
00:23:51.039 --> 00:23:52.789 align:start position:0%
services because i do not have a copy of
0437h

00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
0437h
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
which is probably because i lost it but
 
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to get me a new one but
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
they say that they do not have a fiscal
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
note upstairs and i believe you said
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
is there one
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
he's not
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
check with representative vail yes there
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
is a fiscal note on the bill
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
hb 89 it's the
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
last page
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay they said upstairs they didn't see
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
it but if everybody else has it i'll
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
peek over somebody's shoulder and the
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
second clarifying question is i believe
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
you said that there would be added a
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
developmental pediatrician
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
is that to be added
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
in the amendment or a new amendment or
 
00:24:47.679 --> 00:24:49.269 align:start position:0%
in the amendment or a new amendment or
how

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
no that is already in the new one i was
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
just noting that the actual official
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
board in the minutes of tcmob
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
did not report out the developmental
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
pediatrician um because we realized that
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
after we'd had the vote we did not have
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
time to go back we we had to get this
 
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
turned around out to the senate under a
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
deadline and we didn't meet for another
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
month so uh we just took the liberty of
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
adding that because it was the same type
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
of person it is already in the amendment
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
that i have
 
00:25:17.279 --> 00:25:18.950 align:start position:0%
that i have
submitted

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
so the amendment is clean as it stands
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
do i i do not see any questions from the
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee for either representatives
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
mail or canary am i missing a hand
 
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.470 align:start position:0%
mail or canary am i missing a hand
somewhere

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
i do see one in the upper left hand
 
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.990 align:start position:0%
i do see one in the upper left hand
corner

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
corner
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
yup that's the hand and the chair
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
recognizes that hand and i'm going to
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
probably related to my ignorance about
 
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.750 align:start position:0%
probably related to my ignorance about
the

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.669 align:start position:0%
the
original

00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill and program for therapeutic
 
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.470 align:start position:0%
bill and program for therapeutic
cannabis

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
as you said in your testimony
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
representative kenner
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
there's mention of stand-alone
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
conditions or qualifying diagnosis
 
00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:10.310 align:start position:0%
conditions or qualifying diagnosis
diagnoses

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
diagnoses
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
or qualifying symptoms
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
let's use
 
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.269 align:start position:0%
let's use
insomnia

00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
insomnia
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
which which category is that in is it a
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
is it a standalone condition is it a
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
qualifying symptom
 
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.590 align:start position:0%
qualifying symptom
um

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
what if it's the only symptom without a
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition can you explain how
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
that works yes matt thank you very much
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is put it in as one
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the qualifying symptoms
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
the difficulty here is that we as a
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
board had some concerns about it just
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
being used willy-nilly for the primary
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
problem of poor sleep because again it
 
00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
is probably better that you would use
 
00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.669 align:start position:0%
is probably better that you would use
cognitive

00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
cognitive
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
behavioral therapy and other um
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
types of maneuvers to try to treat
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
insomnia first but there is a very
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
interesting catch-all
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh that exists i i don't have it the
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
statute opened in front of me right now
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
but there is a phraseology in the
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
conditions which says or some other
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
condition which results in the following
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
symptom it really is kind of a loophole
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
that allows somebody to
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
sort of write for a purest symptom i can
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
pull that up but it'll take me just a
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
reasonably well it's this bill adds it
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
as a symptom and we thought probably not
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
to have it as a standalone
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
um yes it it clarifies that it's um not
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
really that clear and so there's a
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's discretion in terms of the
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
person who is
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to um make the decision about it
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
being a qualifying condition
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes and i've finally got it up
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
the phraseology is
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
after the laundry list of qualifying
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
diagnoses the last phrases or one or
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
more injuries or conditions
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
that has resulted in one or more
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
qualifying symptoms under sub-paragraph
 
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.710 align:start position:0%
qualifying symptoms under sub-paragraph
two

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a large loophole it kind of
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
means that you really don't probably
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
have to have any of those conditions so
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
you could uh a person could have just
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:33.750 align:start position:0%
for example
um

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
anxiety not anxiety but some other kind
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
of mental health problem that gives them
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
insomnia and the practitioner may go
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's a reasonable option
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
so there are there are some interesting
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
loopholes in the way that law is written
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee with a question
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
i don't see a hand up and i don't have a
 
00:28:59.830 --> 00:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
text from my wingman indicating so
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
representatives valentink for your
 
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.430 align:start position:0%
representatives valentink for your
testimony

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
the chair calls heather stockwell a
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyist with rights in democracy new
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire she is in support and she says
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
hi i don't know if i'll use up a full
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
three minutes um just wanted to try to
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
be realistic
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
today i appreciate every everyone that's
 
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
spoken and asked questions about this
 
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.070 align:start position:0%
spoken and asked questions about this
bill

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
my husband is someone who provided
 
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.750 align:start position:0%
my husband is someone who provided
testimony

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
on the last go round of this bill and
 
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.710 align:start position:0%
on the last go round of this bill and
suffers

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
suffers
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
from autistic spectrum disorder
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
because in the last year i um i
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
personally have suffered from insomnia
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh did try try some uh thc uh to remedy
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
that and i
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
woke up feeling more refreshed than i
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
had been um in a very long time
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
because i hadn't woken up
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
over and over again throughout the night
 
00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:16.149 align:start position:0%
over and over again throughout the night
so

00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
so there's just a little personal
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
attachment but i also really feel that
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
this is um this is a pretty small uh
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
step in
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh cannabis legalization as someone
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there are safety uh
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
measures taken for developing the
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
products that are in these stores and my
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
feeling is that with the continued
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
adding of conditions
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
that there will be more and more options
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
so for instance someone that prefers
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
less thc or more cbd or none at all
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
there will be more and more options
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh to find the right thing that works
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
for you or you between you and your
 
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
for you or you between you and your
doctor

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.789 align:start position:0%
doctor
um

00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
i do feel that one of the reasons i'm
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
here today too is just for personal
 
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.549 align:start position:0%
here today too is just for personal
rights

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
i think this is uh this is something
 
00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
that has been used as
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
in medicinal ways for
 
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
centuries actually
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
certainly through my lifetime
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
and that these people have been punished
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
throughout my lifetime and we've seen
 
00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:23.919 align:start position:0%
them be oppressed because
 
00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:24.950 align:start position:0%
them be oppressed because
of

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
the use of these drugs instead of
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh so-called prescription drugs which
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
someone also here testified today that
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
those prescription drugs often have uh
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
side effects
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh that aren't beneficial the next day
 
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
and in even can
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
cause a person not to be able to drive
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
or continue working or
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever they need to do
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm also coming at this from a
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
recovery perspective uh in my line of
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
work uh the overdose crisis is a really
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
big piece of what i'm working on and
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
the stories that i've heard from folks
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
in recovery is that
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
this is also uh in the right amounts and
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
the right dosages uh a really beneficial
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
thing for them so i can i would
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
encourage you to continue this uh
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
research and and support this bill
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
for the many people who who are
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
suffering currently and who have
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
suffered in the past
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
thanks so much i will take questions if
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
any i see no questions uh thank you for
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes the lap excuse
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
me the last person who signed up to
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
speak uh at least by 8 30 this morning
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
david cyrek and he is representing
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
himself as a member of the public and he
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm having difficulty finding him in the
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
there's a number of phone numbers only
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
when you asked it looked like uh the
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
phone number raised a hand so maybe we
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
can give that a shot
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay let's see here
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
hello this is dr david sarrick how are
 
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.789 align:start position:0%

sanctuary tc uh we operate medical
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis dispensaries in both plymouth
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
and conway thank you for the opportunity
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%

sanctuary atc is
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
we are in strong support of house bill
 
00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:57.830 align:start position:0%
we are in strong support of house bill
89

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
89
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
as medical director over the last five
 
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.110 align:start position:0%
as medical director over the last five
years

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
i have consulted with say thousands of
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
patients and have heard
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
um directly from them or from our staff
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
that patients often report
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
a this in terms of insomnia report a
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
more solid and restful night's sleep
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
when they medicate at night with
 
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.069 align:start position:0%
when they medicate at night with
cannabis

00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
particularly an indica strain which
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
tends to be more sedating and conducive
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
to sleep
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
and just as cannabis has helped
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
thousands of our patients with chronic
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
pain issues i'd say just as many report
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
on the positive sleep benefits that
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis gives them
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
and although you know what i'm talking
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
about may be anecdotal evidence
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
um these patients reporting to us are
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
coming back to us i mean obviously
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
they're not lying this really helps them
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
with sleep at night
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
many patients report that instead of
 
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.430 align:start position:0%
many patients report that instead of
getting

00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
two to three hours of sleep per night
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
many are sleeping now
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
six to eight hours of of sleep tonight
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
and many of them now are much more
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
functional the next day um which helps
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
them with their with their work and also
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
with their family issues
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and as mentioned before
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
um i guess i believe
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative vale mentioned the
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
endocannabinoid system which is the
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
scientific basis of how cannabis works
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
in our body
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
what cannabis does is help suppress rem
 
00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:20.230 align:start position:0%
what cannabis does is help suppress rem
sleep

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
sleep
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
rapid eye movement sleep which is when
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
we dream but instead it puts us into a
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
more deep level sleep which actually is
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
more therapeutic and lets the body heal
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay so that's kind of the science of
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
how the
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
the plant works in our body in terms of
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
helping patients sleep better in terms
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
of the endocannabinoid system our own
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
internal uh system that's um was
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
genetically inbred in us so let's go
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
back and um
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
discuss quickly a 2020 study
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh in the
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
bmj the british medical journal
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
which was titled medical cannabis and
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
insomnia in older adults with chronic
 
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.589 align:start position:0%
insomnia in older adults with chronic
pain

00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
pain
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
they concluded that medical cannabis use
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
may have an overall positive effect on
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining sleep throughout the night
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
in chronic pain patients
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
so you know based upon our experience
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
with patients at sanctuary atc
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
and um several studies that have shown
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
that indeed cannabis can help with
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
insomnia um we are in strong support of
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
it i didn't really plan on discussing
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorder but i do know
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
that a lot of our patients with asd
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
do benefit from cannabis um so we are
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
also in support of it in turn in terms
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
of the autism spectrum disorder as well
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to me
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you dr uh cyrux are there any

questions from the committee for the
doctor

representative nelson you may ask a
 
00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:00.310 align:start position:0%
representative nelson you may ask a
question

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes uh has autism speaks the
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
i i have not done my research on that
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if representative kirk can
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
maybe comment on that because he's done
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
more of the literature search than i
 
00:37:16.079 --> 00:37:17.510 align:start position:0%
more of the literature search than i
have

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.109 align:start position:0%
have
representative

00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
you may answer that very briefly please
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
if you can uh
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it's very brief i do not know um
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
and actually i have to confess i am not
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
the one that did the deep literature
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
dive on this we have it was somebody
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
else in our committee a couple people in
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
our committee that did the deep dive on
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
this one um so i do not know if that
 
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.069 align:start position:0%
this one um so i do not know if that
organization

00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%

thanks perfect thank you very much um uh
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
i don't want to repeat what dr cyric
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
said so um
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
so um i just wanted to um say a few
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
basic things
 
00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.670 align:start position:0%
basic things
um

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
you know we've been working with
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
patients for almost five years now and
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
insomnia is one of the most common
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
comorbid conditions that we encounter in
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
our current patient base uh who have all
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
been approved for other conditions when
 
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
a person can't sleep it affects nearly
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
every aspect of their health from their
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
mental health to their immune response
 
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
um in my personal experience if there's
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
one thing that cannabis works well for
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's inducing and maintaining sleep um
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
not that there aren't many other uses
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
but that is one of the key things that
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
ends up helping our patients as dr cyric
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
said get rest and really heal from
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
whichever condition they have it's good
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
for almost everything um many of the
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
products we offer are specifically
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
selected and designed for nighttime
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
which is really intended for uh to
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
promote sleep
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
um some are focused on quick onset and
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
short duration to assist patients in
 
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
falling asleep others are formulated for
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
a slower onset and longer duration to
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
keep people asleep
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
and we try to modulate the dosage
 
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.589 align:start position:0%
and we try to modulate the dosage
because

00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
too much of that actually doesn't tend
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
to promote a restful sleep and good rest
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
so it's finding that right balance
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
usually below the level of intoxication
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
um which is able to allow someone to
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
fall asleep and to stay asleep
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
um many new hampshire residents could
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
benefit from access uh to the
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program for
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
treatment of insomnia uh many studies i
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
found that that seem to you know aim to
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
underestimate the rate of insomnia in
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
adults puts it at over 10 percent of the
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
population has chronic insomnia at one
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
section of their life or another
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
um and so overall prime atc supports hp
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
89 as it would allow much needed access
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
to legal regulated and tested cannabis
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
products many of which are specifically
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
targeted for sleep
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
um so thank you very much for for
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%

attest to the fact that we have gone
through

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
a variety of medical uh pharmaceutical
 
00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.030 align:start position:0%
a variety of medical uh pharmaceutical
use

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%

00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
antipsychotics i have to have his

kidneys tested every year he's been on
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
opioids and and many of those psychotic
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
medications can lessen their effect over
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
time with the small use that we've had
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
with medical
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis therapeutic cannabis it has
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
been life-changing i am able to do
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
things with jonathan that i've never
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
been able to do before he's on a very
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
minimal dose
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
he's engaged in his community he can
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
tolerate change and changes in routine
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
which many of you may not know but
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
people on the autism spectrum disorder
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
have a really difficult time with this
 
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i will say the past two years our
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
lives have been completely
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
opened up to a whole new world
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
particularly for him i have friends who
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
also have adults with autism spectrum
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
disorders and they've told me that you
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
know issues such as seizures and and
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
dietary issues have been minimized
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
completely because of the small use of
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana so i just really want
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
to support this i'm here to
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
offer any other personal
 
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.230 align:start position:0%
offer any other personal
um

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
testimony i i will say i was appointed
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
by governor lynch about 10 years ago to
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
serve on the autism commission the first
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
ever so i have been involved in many
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
aspects of asd
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
i've been involved in autism
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
now and organizations and
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
although this is a small component of
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know what happens as far as you know
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
some of the uses and and and
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities there are this has
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
probably been one that has affected our
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
lives positively more than anything so
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take your questions i do
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
have written testimony i'd be happy to
 
00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:08.079 align:start position:0%
send over
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i guess i'll leave it there and i

00:46:31.349 --> 00:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you miss
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
abbott um
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
your testimony was um extremely
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
compelling to me
 
00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:39.270 align:start position:0%
compelling to me
um

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
who had questions someone who had
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
questions about um
 
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:44.470 align:start position:0%
questions about um
this

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.510 align:start position:0%
this
so

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
i wonder if to be further compelling if
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know of any advocacy
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
organizations for autism spectrum
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
disorders that have taken a stand on
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
this either pro or con
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
to answer your question thank you for
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
that question i have heard some small or
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
um you know there autism speaks is the
 
00:47:10.069 --> 00:47:10.079 align:start position:0%
primary one and i think they have
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
they're really looking at some of the um
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
best practices around services and adult
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
transition and there are many many
 
00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
issues i'm sure as you can imagine with
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorder vocational
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
issues adult living you name it this is
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
not something necessarily that has come
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
up very much but i will say that more of
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
more of the community is is looking at
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
this more closely because there are so
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
many people out there like myself and
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
families like ours that are seeing so
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
much benefit from it um and and let me
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
just say i you know my son is 29 i would
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
not recommend this first for someone you
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
know we can look at this from an age
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
perspective as far as as an adult and
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
more and more families who have an adult
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
child or an adult family member with
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorder are looking at
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
this more closely and i'm hearing more
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
and more
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
positive results
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
very few if any negative results
 
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.230 align:start position:0%
very few if any negative results
whatsoever

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
i i'm sorry that probably doesn't answer
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
your question it's the best one i have
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
i see no further hands
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
has lately signed
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
mr chair may i just go ahead and try to
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
help answer that question too
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh yes go ahead
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
okay just simply i went to autism speaks
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
i mean i looked it up they actually do
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
question are wondering whether or not
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to be helpful and they held a
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
consensus conference in 2018
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
about uh research on cannabis and autism
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
and they promised on a post in 2019
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
that they would be um
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know making the consensus available
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
later that year i find nothing on their
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
website on a search for anything more
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
recent or on a google search um
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
and so their final state statement was
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
until then we encourage you to discuss
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis products with your child's
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
health provider before trying them which
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
of course is the way it should work
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
anyway and precisely what therapeutic
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board wishes
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
they did bring up also the concerns in
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
kids and that's why we set up an a much
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
higher barrier for under 21 because of
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
the developing brain so that's the best
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
i can come up with on that thank you
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is the last call for
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee and
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none of either one
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
i call this uh hearing to a close and i
 
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:42.559 align:start position:0%

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%

items that we
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
believed we needed to change in the bill
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%

00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
you 1-0-4-3-7-h to do that don't we
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
yes which is an amendment to hb89
 
00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:47.430 align:start position:0%
yes which is an amendment to hb89
second

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
second representative
 
00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:51.589 align:start position:0%
second representative
mckay

00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
mckay
 
00:50:51.599 --> 00:50:52.710 align:start position:0%
mckay
okay

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:57.349 align:start position:0%
okay
now

00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
so again uh this just simply adds autism
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
spectrum disorder you know again i my
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
apologies for bringing in something that
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
was so different because particularly
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
for the public and uh we did get the
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
word out uh to miss abbott to hear her
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony but the issue is
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
we did place some rather
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
tough restrictions remember for any kid
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
under 18 you already have to have
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
a second opinion
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
of uh anyway you know so basically this
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
sets a really high bar for for kids or
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
anybody under 21 because of the
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
developing brain so it would not be
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
something that would you be used in a
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know willy-nilly fashion but for
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
over 21
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
we did not feel it necessary to have all
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
these extra special consultations so it
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
does expand the scope of this bill but
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
it becomes we thought this bill
 
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
oversight board thought this bill would
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
provide a good opportunity
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to get asd back in since no
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
filed and it was too late when we found
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
that out for me to file one
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
i have a comment
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh state your comment please
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
i i find this testimony very reassuring
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is exactly
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
the way it's supposed to work the
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
original commission five years that's
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
gone to sleep and this
 
00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.150 align:start position:0%
gone to sleep and this
professional

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
organization is providing exactly the
 
00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.150 align:start position:0%
organization is providing exactly the
information

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
that we need to make
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
professional decisions so i find this
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
very reassuring
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mckay
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
am i open now
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
hey my my computer plays tricks on me
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
i find that com i find the testimony
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
here very compelling i did have one
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
question of representative kenner
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
frequently we talk about the human brain
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
only reaching its
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
ultimate state of maturity at age 25
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:53:19.589 --> 00:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
and yet we're using 21 as the cut off is
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
there any reason to be concerned about
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
that discrepancy
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh may i answer yes you may
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes well back when i was in my 50s my
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
wife contended that that maturation
 
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:32.590 align:start position:0%
didn't occur until age 60 but any case
 
00:53:32.590 --> 00:53:35.589 align:start position:0%
didn't occur until age 60 but any case
[Laughter]

00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
well that is a problem we did we did uh
 
00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
work in this because it is
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
21 is not a magical age but we thought
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
that that was a reasonable compromise
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
because also
 
00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.589 align:start position:0%
because also
these

00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:53:47.599 --> 00:53:48.549 align:start position:0%
these
uh

00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
here's what we don't know we don't know
 
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
whether the autism brain matures in a
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
wholly different fashion anyway
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's already an abnormally wired brain
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
if you will and we have no idea exactly
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
how it matures so for now we decided to
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
go with 21 because again by that time is
 
00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.829 align:start position:0%
go with 21 because again by that time is
um

00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
miss abbott
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
commented even even younger you begin to
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
have some real issues if you have a kid
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
who's having some real difficulty with
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
behavior um
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
we compromised on that one we didn't
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
know quite where to set that but decided
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
21 was reasonable
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
by the way oh may i just speak um
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative mckay is right you those
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
who were on the committee from a few
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
years ago remember that every single
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
time we were in testimony i understand
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
on any of these conditions i always
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
raise my hand and ask the same question
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
are legislators supposed to be making
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
these medical decisions and that is why
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
it is that we brought forth this bill to
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
create this board um and this board is
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
indeed functioning at a very high level
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
to provide the input so thank you for
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
that comment representative mckay
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i will confess
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
to being all over the map on this issue
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
on the one hand um
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
my experience as a therapist working
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
with families
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
tells me that there are a lot of
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
negative impact
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
impacts for chronic
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
marijuana use and i think we often give
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
including increasing anxiety and
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
paranoia in people who use cannabis over
 
00:55:30.309 --> 00:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
a long period of time
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
so on the other hand i think prohibition
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
of of cannabis has been such a disaster
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
that i think it should be completely
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
legalized across the board so i'm all
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
over the map about this um
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
i do think that since we are giving it
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
since we are using it as a medicine
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
we should be very careful about
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
how we do that
 
00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.430 align:start position:0%
how we do that
um

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i was ready to vote against this
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
amendment but i was convinced by
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
um ruth abbott's testimony and her
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
testimony about other people besides
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
herself and the little bit we were able
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
to learn about advocacy organizations so
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
i will support it
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative gay thank you
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't have to have a question not
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
this time okay
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
i really wanted to thank everyone who
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
testified especially about personal
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
experience because we all agreed with
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
you so much i'm assuming that everybody
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
felt as positively as i did
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
and so we don't ask questions and when
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
you make when you make testimony that
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
you've agonized over and nobody responds
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
it feels negative so i just wanted to
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
assure everybody who testified that it
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
was very compelling and i very much
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
see no one there's a hand jerry do i see
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
he's not ready he's got his real hand up
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh i see no one sorry i have my physical
 
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:16.510 align:start position:0%

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
actually then to represent shapiro he is
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct and that is that was
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
our concern
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
using well anything anytime we use
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis and kids which is why again we
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
have a very small number of of kids who
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
are qualified
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
the one the problems is recreational
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis is often going to be used at a
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
much higher dose and much more
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
to fulfill other needs or other desires
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
of the person who's using it here when
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
it's used therapeutically
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned one other time in another
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill we start low and
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
then increase slowly for the desired
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
effect so for example five milligrams of
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
thc is a fairly small dose um and that
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
is indeed the difference between the
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
therapeutic program and recreational use
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
where we can have a better way to
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
on representative woods
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um uh to uh
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro's point i think
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
it's well taken
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
however i think they're they're in under
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
these circumstances there's a built-in
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh safety net in the sense that in
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
general there is a limit for the quotes
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
prescription length it's got to be
 
00:58:37.119 --> 00:58:38.630 align:start position:0%
prescription length it's got to be
reviewed

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore and also the fact that
 
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.710 align:start position:0%
and therefore and also the fact that
the

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
the
person

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
not prescribing
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
but providing the registered uh
 
00:58:47.599 --> 00:58:49.750 align:start position:0%
but providing the registered uh
individual

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.789 align:start position:0%
individual
is

00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
very tightly controlled and people that
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
are very familiar with any changes that
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
might be occurring
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
and i think they would ask and we can
 
00:58:59.599 --> 00:59:00.549 align:start position:0%
and i think they would ask and we can
assume

00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
assume
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh like any physician they would be
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
acting responsibly so the fact that
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
there is a fixed time frame
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
by which it has to be renewed and then
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
it would be have to be renewed by people
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
that are very specifically involved
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
professionally in this kind of
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
individual i think the safeguards are
 
00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.470 align:start position:0%
individual i think the safeguards are
there

00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think the point's well taken but i
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
think the safeguards to my perspective
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
are there thank you
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
there is some debate as to the point to
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
which a member of the committee can also
 
00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
keep answering questions in exact
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.750 align:start position:0%
but i don't think it's a
bad

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
bad

and we bring back representative vale

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
good morning again and thank you mr
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
chair and honorable committee members
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure you can hear me
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
before i proceed
 
01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.910 align:start position:0%
before i proceed
yes

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
this will be very fast i filed hb 90 as
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
a prime sponsor following the filing by
 
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
a member who was not reelected
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
the mistake i made was not reaffirming
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
that this is the right time for the bill
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
this evening last evening it came to
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
light during a phone call with the
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
person who would be providing testimony
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
that the time has come and gone for this
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
bill due to the oversupply in the market
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
which decreases the quality and makes
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
sourcing quality products much more
 
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.750 align:start position:0%
sourcing quality products much more
difficult

01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
therefore i ask the committee to please
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
vote to itl the bill as it's not
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
relevant at this time and i can take any
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
representative there when i got your
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
email last night i spent a few minutes
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
the times that i had put a bill in only
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
the asset of the ito for any number of
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
reasons and any of us who've been here
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
for a while have done this
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:06:43.829 --> 01:06:43.839 align:start position:0%
and i do have um representative nurk's
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
hand and i would like to call on him
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i'm sorry i missed the
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
email last night could you clarify
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
what you meant by the um
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
oversupply could you clarify that a
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
little bit more for me
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
certainly representative kirk uh canard
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:07:07.599 --> 01:07:08.710 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
the

01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
you've probably seen that there's a lot
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
of cbd on the market it's on neon signs
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
over smoke shops it's in
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
in 7-elevens and at the time this bill
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
was in conception
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
not at that that was not the case at all
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
and i believe that this would impact
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
negatively in fact because sourcing um
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
the quality products will be harder to
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
distinguish from those that have the
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
unknown compounds that i discussed in
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
the difficulty is that the cbd we see
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
all over the place
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
is totally unregulated i have a separate
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
bill and we're not supposed to talk
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
about that but i have a separate billing
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
that looks at the regulation of the cbd
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
that is being marketed which is outside
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the atcs
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
because this one was for in the atc's i
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
do not have this since the
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is not a medical question therefore
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
tcmob did not make a comment about this
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping we have
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
um michael holt on this
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
who would be able to testify a little
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
bit more about it but
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that it's
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
totally different that the market for
 
01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:27.189 align:start position:0%
totally different that the market for
cbd

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
cbd
 
01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:28.309 align:start position:0%
cbd
um

01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
in you know the corner grocery store and
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
everywhere else is totally unregulated
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
some of them don't even contain cbd even
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
though they claim they do they're not
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
tested for impurities or iron or i'm
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
sorry or cadmium or mercury or
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
pesticides some are some are reliable
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
but there's it's an unregulated market
 
01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
so um hopefully we'll hear more from
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
representatives sorry from michael holt
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
about whether this is helpful or not to
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
am i to answer this question as a
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
if you wish i see michael holt is
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
has signed up i do not know if he's in
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
the meeting and can be called up um if
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
he wishes to when he if he's here and if
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
he wishes to would he put his hand up
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
please but yes representative there go
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
i was just
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to take it further by
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
saying that when an outside product so
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
this would be introducing an outside
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
product an outside source
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
for medication that will be made and
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
distributed in the
 
01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.470 align:start position:0%
distributed in the
dispensary

01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
dispensary
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
therefore it will have to be tested and
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
it will have to be determined to be
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
a proper source
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
because of all the unknowns that are
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
coming up with changes in the program
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
and legislation that may be in the other
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
body at this time
 
01:09:57.030 --> 01:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
all of the factors considered
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
the um the hemp cbd is an oversupply and
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
it just makes a really difficult time
 
01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
for us to get something that we can
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
really test and have that that solid
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
integrity that we're used to by having
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
the self-contained and the um the
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
self-sourced um model that we're using
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
for the tcp
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you did we find representative
 
01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:28.149 align:start position:0%
thank you did we find representative
uh

01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
sorry mr holt anywhere uh yes um my name

thank you for the record my name is
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
michael holt i'm the administrator of
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program with
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.470 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
the department does not take a position
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
on this bill i can provide some
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
background um and what we really need to
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
hear from is uh the atc's if they are on
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
the call as well um because they would
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
be able to provide the testimony
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
to say whether or not this bill is uh
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
needed or helpful
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding um so first to the bill
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
language um the bill does require any uh
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
outsourced um cbd product isolate
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
product to be tested in accordance with
 
01:11:19.990 --> 01:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire uh law and rules um not
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
only the concentrate isolate itself but
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
also the products made from it
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
thus ensuring a high quality product um
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
free of contaminants per uh new
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire rule
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
um the origin of this i believe and i
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
believe the atcs can testify to this a
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
little better is that um
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
the seeds plants grow differently the
 
01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
the seeds plants grow differently the
the

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
the atcs have expressed a need to
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
outsource cbd because they cannot
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
produce enough of it it within
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
their current production facilities so
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
this would be a value to them to be able
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
to provide a wider range of cbd products
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
um for their patients
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
than they can currently
 
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.910 align:start position:0%
than they can currently
provide

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
we can accomplish
 
01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:13.669 align:start position:0%
we can accomplish
this

01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
in a safe manner but again it would be
 
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
up to the atcs to testify whether or not
 
01:12:22.310 --> 01:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
this is uh is still needed
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
and i would i would i'm happy to answer
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
i see no hands up
 
01:12:37.679 --> 01:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
i see no hands up
or

01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
any text indicating this anybody from
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh is michael mclaughlin here
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
he is listed as representing the
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
sanctuary alternative treatment center

01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
desire of having somebody from an atc is
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%

to be louder
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
i did by era i signed in and favored the
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
bill this morning but i talked to the uh
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
i clan earlier and they indicated they
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
were against the bill so i did not hear
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
michael holt's discussion uh
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
i was on a phone call but we are not in
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill they do not like the
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
thought of bringing out of state uh
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
canadian into the system
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%

01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
he doesn't like the idea of out-of-state
 
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.550 align:start position:0%
he doesn't like the idea of out-of-state
products

01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
all the materials that we provide to our
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
patients are manufactured in the state
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
tested in the state under strict control
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
so they're not comfortable with material
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%

support of it um you know especially a
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
couple years ago seeing the ability to

more efficiently grow hemp outdoors uh
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
versus utilizing power indoors to do it
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
however um watching the
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
cbd isolate and and um the hemp industry
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
nationwide over the last few years it
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
has resulted in a large number of
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know kind of inconsistent and in
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
many cases mediocre products that do not
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
meet our standards
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
now while we are able to formulate this
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
isolate and these compounds into
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
successful products
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
we also
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
you know want to continue to do what
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
we're doing which is producing
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
everything we make in-house in new
 
01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.910 align:start position:0%
everything we make in-house in new
hampshire

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
using employees from new hampshire and
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
the resources in new hampshire
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
and i think we have concerns at this
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
point with
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
the a kind of slippery slope of bringing
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
in products from outside that group
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
whether we test them here to confirm or
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
not i i would certainly be open and i
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
think um i can't speak for the other
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
atc's but i think we would be open
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
if we were able to produce it in new
 
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.630 align:start position:0%
if we were able to produce it in new
hampshire

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
we under a known circumstance that we
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
were able to oversee throughout the
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
process or be involved with throughout
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
the process i think we could see
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
utilizing hemp cbd
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
which would allow us to cultivate or
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
allow a partner to cultivate outdoors or
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
in a greenhouse which isn't really
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
currently uh possible under the
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
regulations for the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
program the security and other aspects
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
of how it's written make that
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
impractical however
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
for cbd in this scenario
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
we are able to keep up at this point uh
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
with our business with our cbd needs
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
we after finishing a large cultivation
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
build out and we believe that we can
 
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
continue to do so in the future under uh
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
basically under
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh an environment and under a situation
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
where we take absolute uh pride in the
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
quality the cleanliness and everything
 
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
we do so at this point
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
i think the preference of prime atc
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
would be to cultivate
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
everything in-house um and to reconsider
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
if we are able to oversee an outdoor
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
hemp cbd
 
01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
process and cultivation process
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
so if anyone has any questions i'm happy
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%

we will
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
close the hearing and we will have to
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
execute it at a later time which could
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

medical oversight board
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh point of point of order mr chairman
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's 10 20. i don't think you can
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
open a hearing scheduled for 10 30 at 10
 
01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.390 align:start position:0%
open a hearing scheduled for 10 30 at 10
20.

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
10 30. we're absolutely correct and i
 
01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.830 align:start position:0%
10 30. we're absolutely correct and i
think

01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
i would be delighted to make a motion if
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
you would care to open an executive
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
session on uh house bill 90. yeah
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
is is there any is there any sentiment
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the room that you
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
want to sit on this for a week or you
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
want to bring back
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
amendments or or are we good to go
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
whichever way we choose to vote are we
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
good to go on
 
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.830 align:start position:0%
good to go on
executing

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
looks like well and i i do thank the
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
honorable gentlelady for that uh not
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
only because she's correct but
 
01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:17.610 align:start position:0%
we can get this job done so with that um
 
01:22:17.610 --> 01:22:19.750 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
i'd be glad to make a motion
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
who is speaking yes yes please make a
 
01:22:25.199 --> 01:22:26.870 align:start position:0%
who is speaking yes yes please make a
motion

01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh i think you have to open the
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
executive session first if we didn't do
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
that yet i do
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
and since i think i opened 5.99 but
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
incorrectly it doesn't
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
count and now i will open the executive
 
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:41.990 align:start position:0%
count and now i will open the executive
station

01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
station
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
90 and recognize the gentlelady from
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
17 i forget your towns but
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
to make a motion
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you it's the gentlelady from
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
walpole and uh i would move itl on house
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
bill 90 on the basis that
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
it was very much wanted when it was
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
introduced situations have changed and
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
it now appears that it is not as useful
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
as it might have been at an earlier time
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
so i move itl
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative march seconds four
 
01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:18.070 align:start position:0%
representative march seconds four
seconds

01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
now discussions which can be
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
not questions
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
i think i've discussed it as much as it
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
does anybody else
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
and see no hands and um
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
trying to keep up with what i was asked
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
to do there were 10 people who decided
 
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
for support
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%

01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
as to pass
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
there was one person who signed in to
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
oppose it passing and that was the prime
 
01:23:58.719 --> 01:24:01.270 align:start position:0%
oppose it passing and that was the prime
sponsor

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%

01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay hang on a second let me just mute
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
the background sound here mute
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative acton you're recording
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you mr chair and uh thank
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
you committee members
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
i i'm just a little bit confused here so
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
i want to just take a step back to make
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
sure that we're
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
we all understand what's going on here
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh when this first came in
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
several years ago it was based on on the
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
lack of availability of of quality
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
hemp products within the state
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
i believe that's changing somebody can
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
correct me if not
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
we now have a hemp
 
01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
program in the state that's actually
 
01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.790 align:start position:0%
program in the state that's actually
functional

01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
functional
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
what i think i'm seeing here is that
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
atc's are now starting to grow their own
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
hemp in state that they weren't allowed
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:02.709 align:start position:0%
to do
even

01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
last year or the year before i know unh
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
has been pushing for hemp production and
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
so that seems to be
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
moving forward so
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
i'll agree to the itl but i but i am
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
worried that we've only heard from one
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
atc and and i'm assuming that they're
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
producing their own so they've started
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
their own hemp production
 
01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.350 align:start position:0%
their own hemp production
in

01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
business in
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
in concert with their atc but i really
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
would love to hear more
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
from to mescal and
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
the other atc's as to if if they aren't
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
are they going to be hampered by not
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
being able to source their own
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
cbd's and then in essence this is a
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
business model
 
01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:45.910 align:start position:0%
business model
issue

01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
between atcs versus
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
a solution to the problem where the
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
where the
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:06.149 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
weber

01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
i would say that um i believe we heard
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
from two different
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
industry representatives and
 
01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative clerk is giving me a
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
victory sign which i think means that he
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
agrees with me
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
and uh then the other thing is that this
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
is a properly noticed public hearing
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
members who want to talk about something
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
have a duty
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
members the public who want to talk
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
about something have a duty to sign up
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
and make their wishes known
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think it is the business of the
 
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.229 align:start position:0%
i don't think it is the business of the
committee

01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh except in very
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
specific and and i think narrow cases to
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
go out looking for people unless unless
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
serious questions have been raised about
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
the way we're going i mean it just seems
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
to me axiomatic at this point that the
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor doesn't want the bill the two
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
people who are here
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
from the industry don't want the bill
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
and and we've heard testimony
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
from um
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
the regulating authority
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
as to why it may not be needed anymore
 
01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:17.430 align:start position:0%
as to why it may not be needed anymore
so

01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
my thought would be to go ahead but
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's just me
 
01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:21.830 align:start position:0%
that's just me
okay

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
follow up if i could mr chairman yes
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative actor i
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
the only reason why i'm asking is this
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
itl changeover came in last night so
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
they may not even know so that that's
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
the issue um but you know
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
these problems have a tendency of of
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
working themselves out it doesn't always
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
require us to pass laws and that uh
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
seems like the situation we're in here
 
01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.709 align:start position:0%
seems like the situation we're in here
so

01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's all i need to say thank you
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
i might observe that it's been my
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
experience and sometimes it's a good
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
thing to show up
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
even if it looks like it's slammed up in
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
your favor because things have a way of
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
changing and on a couple of occasions i
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
am so glad
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
i appeared when i thought i didn't need
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
to but it proved i really did
 
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:09.189 align:start position:0%
to but it proved i really did
and

01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
there is no other person on the even on
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
the in list one way or the other about
 
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.149 align:start position:0%
the bill
so

01:28:18.149 --> 01:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative webber's point is very
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
well taken
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
i see representative
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's conner
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the upper left corner
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
yes um yes thank you and i i agree uh
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
whether they thought it was gonna be an
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
ital or not if they had a concern they
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be here and the only reason i
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
raised alarms in the beginning was
 
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
because it was fundamentally so
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
different than it was the previous year
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
but i think we've heard very compelling
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that we actually don't need
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
this now and so i agree with
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
representing weber that we should
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
proceed with an itl and i think we can
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
be comfortable doing it at this point
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
um my only comment is that you know just
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
because we don't need this now i mean i
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
think it it broadens the freedom of what
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
these a
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers can do
 
01:29:13.590 --> 01:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
and just because it's not
 
01:29:15.110 --> 01:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
needed now there may be changes in the
 
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.550 align:start position:0%
needed now there may be changes in the
market

01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.510 align:start position:0%
market
and

01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
the the reasoning behind it
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
is still a little bit unclear for me
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
why they're against it just because they
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't need it um
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just inclined to
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
broaden freedom of this industry to
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
to acquire
 
01:29:34.639 --> 01:29:36.229 align:start position:0%
to acquire
um

01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
these these have derived
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
um cbd isolates from elsewhere if they
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands from the
 
01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.550 align:start position:0%

01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
we're at the very end of a long
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
process where we've gone through a lot
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
of uh therapeutic cannabis bills
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
um this year and and i have to admit
 
01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
that this once looked through the cracks
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
01:44:39.510 --> 01:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't understand
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
some of the legislation and i received
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
some very marked
 
01:44:43.199 --> 01:44:44.709 align:start position:0%
some very marked
um

01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
input on how it is not going to work and
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'll allow the people who testify
 
01:44:51.910 --> 01:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
to explain but i think the best course
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
of action here is an itl so um i will uh
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
close my remarks and and allow others to
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
um including i believe michael holt to
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
comment on this and we can proceed thank
 
01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:04.550 align:start position:0%

01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
we will
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is michael
 
01:45:37.750 --> 01:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
holt i'm the administrator of the
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh the the department does register
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill i thought that
 
01:45:46.709 --> 01:45:46.719 align:start position:0%
my testimony would come after
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
representative canerx to be honest
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
as he is the chair of the tcmob
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
um but i can provide some introductory
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
remarks here
 
01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would create a duplicate
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
conflicting requirement for the clinical
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
review of all existing qualifying
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
medical conditions
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
for the therapeutic use of cannabis
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
currently this clinical review
 
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility belongs to the 13-member
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
board which is charged with the
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility of reviewing current and
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
new medical conditions and making
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations to add or remove them
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
from law
 
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
under the current statutory model such
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations to add or remove a
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
condition would be made to the
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner of hhs who could then
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
choose to seek legislation to add or
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
remove those conditions this bill
 
01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
proposes a duplicate conflicting
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the review of all
 
01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
existing conditions places it on a
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
single individual the medical director
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
of dhhs with no additional appropriation
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
for resources requires that information
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
to be reported within 90 days of the
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
bill's passage to the joint legislative
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
oversight committee on health and human
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
services it's a duplicate process
 
01:46:57.669 --> 01:46:57.679 align:start position:0%
it's a conflicting
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
requirement that is
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
envisioned in the current law
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
considering that there are 21 identified
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
medical diagnoses a catch-all that could
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
include any medical diagnosis and 10
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
associated qualifying symptoms and any
 
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
combination thereof it's simply not
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
feasible for such a review to be
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
undertaken by a single person with no
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
additional resources and completed
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
within a 90-day time frame
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
the second thing that this bill does is
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
creates a
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
or adds a conflict of interest provision
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
for these board members again this is a
 
01:47:31.199 --> 01:47:32.470 align:start position:0%
for these board members again this is a
duplicate

01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
duplicate
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
requirement with the financial
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements already required
 
01:47:41.109 --> 01:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
for this board under rsa 15a established
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
establishes an additional requirement
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
where members of the board would need to
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
identify any financial disclosures at
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
board meetings before taking actions um
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
on on
 
01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.709 align:start position:0%
on on
a

01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
topic that comes up during a meeting so
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's additional um it's redundant work
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
but it's also a higher standard than
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
other boards and commissions in the
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
state for these reasons the department
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
there was a very good reason why the
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
chair did not immediately recognize
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
representative kenner
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
i read my paper wrong
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.239 --> 01:48:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i yes indeed um i've
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
already told you who i am representing
 
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
jerry kinnick representative carroll
 
01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
county three um and that i'm the chair
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
of the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
oversight board we've already talked
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
about who they are
 
01:48:51.189 --> 01:48:51.199 align:start position:0%
again 599 is an unnecessary and
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
unworkable bill reflecting the lack of
 
01:48:54.550 --> 01:48:54.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the complexities of
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
decision making and how the tcmob
 
01:48:57.119 --> 01:48:59.109 align:start position:0%
decision making and how the tcmob
functions

01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
functions
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
as we said this puts a review which is
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
duplicative and 90-day period by the
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
chief medical officer um which contrary
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
to what stated in the bill he is not the
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
chairperson of the board i'm currently
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
the chair but the issue is that the
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
proper evaluation of a qualifying
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
condition requires a lot more
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
consideration of that
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
you've heard my testimony on other
 
01:49:20.229 --> 01:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
conditions and discussed some of the
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
detailed processes we follow we usually
 
01:49:24.149 --> 01:49:24.159 align:start position:0%
start with a discussion at a board
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
meeting we appoint a subcommittee to go
 
01:49:28.310 --> 01:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
do a deep dive in the literature because
 
01:49:29.590 --> 01:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
since we have a number of different
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
medical specialties involved they can
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
look at the ones for the area they know
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
best they then report back to the board
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
of the subsequent meeting we hold a
 
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing for example that's what
 
01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
we got to hear from miss abbott that
 
01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
testified in the previous bill and then
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
we put up together a total draft report
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee does a draft report
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
combining that scientific evidence and
 
01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:52.639 align:start position:0%
the hearing testimony
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's presented to the full board we
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
then discuss it and sometimes we even
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
take more than one meeting to really
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
finally come down with some language we
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
draft language to cover special
 
01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.310 align:start position:0%
draft language to cover special
considerations

01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
and then finalize a recommendation to
 
01:50:09.990 --> 01:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature it functions the tcmov
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
functions very well and is very diligent
 
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
utilizing their personal experience
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislative reviews or sorry literature
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
reviews and testimonials from the
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
patients to make its recommendations
 
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
so it really just doesn't make sense we
 
01:50:25.590 --> 01:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
already have evaluated a number of
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
different conditions i think it's five
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
all together mostly at the behest of
 
01:50:30.629 --> 01:50:30.639 align:start position:0%
bills that have come in but we are
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
planning to start working on the other
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
things this last year we focused on
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
the educational program so we didn't get
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
a lot done on other uh
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
pulling up already approved
 
01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.149 align:start position:0%
pulling up already approved
conditions

01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh the second part yes is unnecessary
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it does hold we already submit
 
01:50:47.350 --> 01:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
financial disclosure forms i don't have
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
to do it because i do it through the
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
legislation right through the
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
legislature and
 
01:50:52.239 --> 01:50:53.189 align:start position:0%
legislature and
the

01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
the requirement of having to disclose
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
before every action is indeed a higher
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
level not only for other boards but it's
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
a higher level than we hold our
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
legislators to
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
and the issue is that the inclusion of
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
participation of representatives of the
 
01:51:06.719 --> 01:51:08.229 align:start position:0%
participation of representatives of the
atc's

01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
atc's
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
and of the provi of providers who do
 
01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:11.990 align:start position:0%
and of the provi of providers who do
certify

01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
certify
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
is to balance that we also have
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
providers who are very very skeptical
 
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:17.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
skeptical about therapeutic cannabis and
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
so we end up with quite a diversity of
 
01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
opinions which makes chairing the
 
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.470 align:start position:0%
opinions which makes chairing the
beatings

01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
beatings
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
really interesting because we really
 
01:51:26.159 --> 01:51:27.030 align:start position:0%
really interesting because we really
have

01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
a very just uh
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
very important points of view that are
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
brought in from all sides and that that
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
requirement sorry that uh is actually a
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
strength of this and so it's not a
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest it's negative it's
 
01:51:41.830 --> 01:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
a conflict it's a
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's a positive tension that it adds to
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
the board in terms of its work that it
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
does sony i urge you to
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
move itl on this bill because it really
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
enhampers the ability of pm tcmob to
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
make sound scientific discussions which
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
take into account the needs of the
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
patients the needs of the providers
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
the atc's and the therapeutic cannabis
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:19.830 --> 01:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
i see a hand up along the bottom but i
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
is there anyone on the committee who
 
01:52:32.950 --> 01:52:32.960 align:start position:0%

of bills we were kind of just
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
grabbing them and taking them over and
 
01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:20.550 align:start position:0%
grabbing them and taking them over and
seeing

01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
which one worked uh for each of us
 
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
um and in in this case i was already
 
01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
overextended this came in
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
and i should have caught some of these
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
things beforehand um it's not a good
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
idea to
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
use the hearing as a way to vet a bill
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
but um i do apologize for that and
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
certainly to michael holt who i've
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%

02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
how you get the wider screen you just do

it so as you move it closer and you

start losing that perspective
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
so then
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%

02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you mr chairman um
 
02:04:29.679 --> 02:04:34.790 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you mr chairman um
oh

02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
it is the correct amendment thank you mr
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um as um as i imagine people
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
remember this is a
 
02:04:45.430 --> 02:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
bill which allows which initially was
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
meant to extend
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
um the prescription supply of
 
02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:53.870 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:55.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:04:59.109 --> 02:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
to 90-day supplies instead of
 
02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
60-day supplies and that was to improve
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
the continuity of care
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
to decrease co-payments and really as a
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
convenience for families who were um
 
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
constantly having to restock these
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
medications so
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
really was um
 
02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
just adds narcolepsy which um is treated
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
with the same medications and and
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
includes narcolepsy for a 90-day supply
 
02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
now when i submitted this amendment they
 
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
didn't write it ex precisely as i um
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
asked them to
 
02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:38.149 align:start position:0%
asked them to
um

02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:39.750 --> 02:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
but i think i was being too much of a
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
perfectionist and i think it's probably
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
adequate i'm going to ask representative
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
merchant as a pharmacist to comment on
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
it but my concern is that it covers
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
there are five subcategories of add
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
including um
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
inattentive type with hyperactivity and
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
impulsivity combined type not otherwise
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
specified so i'd like to ask
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative merchant if he could
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
comment on the way this is written which
 
02:06:10.070 --> 02:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
is the way that was written in the
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
02:06:14.070 --> 02:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
would be adequate for pharmacists um
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
getting these prescriptions to include
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
all the different subtypes of abd what i
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
ask representative shapiro is that you
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
move the amendment and it's seconded and
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
then we can discuss it we will call up
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.199 --> 02:06:32.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
i thought i did but maybe i didn't i
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
0408 for house bill 582
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%

02:06:44.639 --> 02:06:45.990 align:start position:0%
who is that

thank you mr chairman
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
um to speak to the issue of concern that
 
02:06:57.910 --> 02:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative farrell has as a
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
pharmacist it's actually written i think
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
appropriately um we're not getting into
 
02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
sub-categories of a diagnosis we're
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
looking at things at the macro level and
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
i think at that point in time where it
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
belongs is not try to get into the
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
sub-therapeutic diagnosis so the way the
 
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
bill is written today i as a pharmacist
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for my old years you please
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
trailed off are you are you saying the
 
02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is okay the amendment's okay
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
the way it's written actually is is
 
02:07:31.030 --> 02:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
preferred because it's actually at the
 
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
macro level um versus getting into the
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
sub-therapeutics of sub-diagnosis if you
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
will under the macro
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
um so therefore i will support the bill
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
actually the amendment to the bill and
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the sponsor
 
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:49.280 align:start position:0%

and representative woods if you would
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%

02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
record on that one so uh we're gonna
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
we're just gonna look at each other for
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
four minutes and 34 seconds before uh
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 146 comes up at its schedule

marsha's amendment to house bill 605
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
and as we might be executing that in the

and as we might be executing that in the
afternoon

02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
if that came into your computers
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
you can either download it print it out
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
now look at it now it's very brief or
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
you could do that over the lunch hour
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:14.390 --> 02:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
i just want everybody to know how really
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
bitter i am looking out the window at
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
this gorgeous warm sunny day and here we
 
02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:20.629 align:start position:0%
this gorgeous warm sunny day and here we
are

02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
all stuck in our various inside slots
 
02:12:24.159 --> 02:12:25.109 align:start position:0%
all stuck in our various inside slots
but

02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
um needs must so here we go
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
feeling like a sprint out there though
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
yeah take yourself outside
 
02:12:36.550 --> 02:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
add to that four inches of fresh powder
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
for those of us who like to
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
cross-country ski in a beautiful day
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
like today
 
02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
well i was thinking that among other
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
things the speaker's office that with
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
all the money they're saving on mileage
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
and toll remissions
 
02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
the whole committee could go to florida
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:00.550 --> 02:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
social distance we can bring our pets we
 
02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.669 align:start position:0%
social distance we can bring our pets we
can

02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
i was shown which way the door was so it
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
was not going to happen you forgot to
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
invite them
 
02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.109 align:start position:0%
invite them
darn

02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.870 --> 02:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
yep but i had to go out and scrape the
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
snow off the panel so it would really
 
02:13:29.910 --> 02:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
work well it's still working still
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
working on shedding the part i couldn't
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
get yeah we were lucky enough not to get
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
that much snow so it's gone
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
so your panels are not on the seat on
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
the roof
 
02:13:43.430 --> 02:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
my my solar panels are on the on the
 
02:13:45.510 --> 02:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
roof but we only got less than an inch
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
we put taps into our trees on sunday
 
02:13:59.189 --> 02:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
because at least in the massachusetts
 
02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:01.119 align:start position:0%
border it's going to be in the 40s
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
weber you're already in florida
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
yeah really look at that i do my poor
 
02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
yeah really look at that i do my poor
best

02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
and growth in the right direction
 
02:14:28.709 --> 02:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
it's great and then when you prune the
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
summer it's to kind of back you
 
02:14:32.709 --> 02:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
know actually for joe who's a fellow
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
gardener i've already started greens to
 
02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
do a spring an early spring transplant
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
into the greenhouse next week and i
 
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
started peas inside and i just
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
transplanted those out last night to the
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
greenhouse and it's about 80 degrees in
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
there today
 
02:14:51.669 --> 02:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
big enough
 
02:14:54.870 --> 02:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
and if we pass home grow you can start
 
02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:55.470 align:start position:0%
oh never mind
 
02:14:55.470 --> 02:15:00.870 align:start position:0%
oh never mind
[Laughter]

02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
i got a big lettuce factory going in my
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
basement under the lights right now it's
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
actually nice to have fresh lettuce
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it is we in the greenhouse i'm
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
loaded with lettuce and we have fresh
 
02:15:18.550 --> 02:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
salad every single night it's fabulous
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
we bought the house it had a greenhouse
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
added to one side of the garage but the
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
previous owner planted trees in front of
 
02:15:26.079 --> 02:15:27.109 align:start position:0%
previous owner planted trees in front of
it

02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
and so um this summer the job is going
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
to be cutting all those trees down and
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
then adding solar panels above the
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
greenhouse area so um
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
that that's our goal for that's our
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
project this summer
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
be cautious about one thing when you put
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
the solar panels there they do shed snow
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
a lot better than a roof and they'll
 
02:15:49.109 --> 02:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
shut it right out of the greenhouse
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
which may be
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
yeah our greenhouse is domed
 
02:15:57.599 --> 02:15:58.470 align:start position:0%
yeah our greenhouse is domed
good

02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
so it's it uh i mean it's it's a very
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful greenhouse yeah um
 
02:16:05.510 --> 02:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
and why
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
they planted these trees there
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
i have no clue
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
they weren't thinking no they they
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
definitely were not
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
declares it's not only 11 15 somewhere
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's 11 15 here
 
02:16:22.470 --> 02:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
and with that i open the hearing on
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%

wouldn't we not want to know what is
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
being injected into our bodies
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%

shop
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
shop there is more than one manufacturer
 
02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
and the only the active ingredients were
 
02:17:25.359 --> 02:17:26.629 align:start position:0%
and the only the active ingredients were
listed

02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
listed
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
so my question is what is the makeup of
 
02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:30.319 align:start position:0%
the inactive ingredients and do they
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
differ from manufacturer to manufacture
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
so all this still does is if you're a
 
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
patient or a legal guardian and you want
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
to know
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
what the health care provider or person
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
giving an injection is
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
and you ask them they need to furnish
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
you with a list of all ingredients
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's important
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
they don't have to furnish it to
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
everyone but only those who ask
 
02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
some of us read our labels on our food
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
and some of us don't
 
02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee for the
 
02:18:08.399 --> 02:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee for the
sponsor

02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:15.429 --> 02:18:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question am i right in
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
understanding that you are
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
not requiring a label you're just
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
requiring that the list of ingredients
 
02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:31.190 align:start position:0%
requiring that the list of ingredients
be

02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
furnished either on an internet or or by
 
02:18:34.399 --> 02:18:35.669 align:start position:0%
furnished either on an internet or or by
request

02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
rather than having to label every
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
individual product is that correct
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
representative weber um so when you go
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
to the doctors and you they want say a
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
tetanus shot because every one of us
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
needs one of those every 10 years
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
and they say you know it's time for your
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
tetanus shot
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
well what's in the tetanus shot
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have any way of knowing
 
02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:00.950 align:start position:0%
we don't have any way of knowing
so

02:19:00.950 --> 02:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking that the physician or
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
whoever's furnishing that injection to
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
you you can ask them i'd like to see a
 
02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
list of the ingredients
 
02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:12.870 align:start position:0%
list of the ingredients
um

02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:14.709 align:start position:0%
um
okay

02:19:14.709 --> 02:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:19:20.469 --> 02:19:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
i see uh representative merchants
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
um the way this is written
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
you help me explain this healthcare
 
02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:33.270 align:start position:0%
you help me explain this healthcare
provider

02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
that would be encompassing all health
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
care providers including a dentist even
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian um
 
02:19:41.030 --> 02:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
plus it would also include all locations
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
of health care whether it be a hospital
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
an urgent care center an emergency room
 
02:19:48.070 --> 02:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
and so forth is that
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
help me understand to clarify that for
 
02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:50.870 align:start position:0%
help me understand to clarify that for
me

02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question so it was
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
my intention um
 
02:19:57.190 --> 02:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
with with the writing of this bill
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
is that if you go to whether it's your
 
02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:00.790 align:start position:0%
is that if you go to whether it's your
doctor

02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh clinic or even
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy and they want to give you
 
02:20:06.870 --> 02:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
an injection
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
you should have the right to know what's
 
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
in that injection
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
what i my intent was is that anyone
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's gonna gonna give you an injection
 
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
you can request it's not mandated that
 
02:20:20.550 --> 02:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
um that they have to supply it to
 
02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
everyone it's only for those people who
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
all of it for me yes you may yes so
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
would you see that impeding the patient
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
care where all of a sudden the provider
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the information to treat
 
02:20:42.870 --> 02:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
the patient
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about a hospital setting
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
even an urgent care setting where the
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
patient requested
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
but the provider may not have all the
 
02:20:51.750 --> 02:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
information that's one concern number
 
02:20:51.760 --> 02:20:53.110 align:start position:0%
information that's one concern number
two

02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
within the manufacturing of
 
02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical products
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for the inactive
 
02:20:59.190 --> 02:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
ingredients sometimes to change from
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to manufacturer which could
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
put an onus on to the provider and being
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
able to timely provide care to the
 
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.389 align:start position:0%
able to timely provide care to the
patient

02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question and
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
but if i'm getting a shot and i
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
understand that and that was one of the
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
things i brought up but is it the the
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
ingredients do change from manufacturers
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
to manufacture
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
but shouldn't the person giving an
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
injection know what what's in that
 
02:21:26.319 --> 02:21:27.429 align:start position:0%
injection know what what's in that
injection

02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
injection
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
how do they know that you may not have a
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
an allergic reaction to something that's
 
02:21:31.359 --> 02:21:32.070 align:start position:0%
an allergic reaction to something that's
in

02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
to one of those ingredients
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
i mean isn't there due diligence to do
 
02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:37.030 align:start position:0%
i mean isn't there due diligence to do
that

02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
to know that
 
02:21:38.319 --> 02:21:39.429 align:start position:0%
to know that
so

02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
my question is why don't they already
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh the chair recognizes himself for a
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
question uh representative
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
is do you is it not the case now
 
02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:54.230 align:start position:0%
is do you is it not the case now
increasingly

02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
increasingly
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
in restaurants and in some cases by law
 
02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
they have to let you know on the menu if
 
02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:00.710 align:start position:0%
they have to let you know on the menu if
there's

02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:22:02.469 --> 02:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
peanuts in the kitchen if there's
 
02:22:04.469 --> 02:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
something that many people have an
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
allergy to on the menu somewhere and
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
isn't it increasingly the case
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
in previous years that uh people selling
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
canned goods had to let you know
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
everything you know frozen foods
 
02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
so isn't it the case that what you're
 
02:22:21.030 --> 02:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
just suggesting is yeah if it involves
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
work they're gonna have to do what
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
everybody else did
 
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
in restaurants in selling groceries
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
that's what that was do you do you think
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's parallel
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and yes i do and
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
um you know we even went so far in them
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the meat industry as saying that we
 
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
even wanted to know what country things
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
were coming from
 
02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.030 align:start position:0%
were coming from
um

02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:45.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
they already know it's in the
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
ingredients that are in their products
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they should be supplying that we we
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
should have the right to know and
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
depending on what you when i started the
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
web some people supplied both the active
 
02:23:01.750 --> 02:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
and inactive ingredients and some didn't
 
02:23:04.870 --> 02:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
it was a very interesting research uh
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
when i when i did that but because we
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
don't know which manufacturer or what's
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
being injected into us you know we don't
 
02:23:14.630 --> 02:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
we can't make a um
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
informative decision on what's going to
 
02:23:18.950 --> 02:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
work best for us for the patient
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative shapiro
 
02:23:24.309 --> 02:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking this question
 
02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:28.550 align:start position:0%
representative for taking this question
um

02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
generally i'm in favor of um consumers
 
02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
especially what they're ingesting i'm
 
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
curious as to why
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
this bill just covers um injections and
 
02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
not medication taken
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
orally uh thank you thank you for the
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
question um i do believe and i'm not
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
positive because i don't take a lot of
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
medication um but i believe when you get
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
your medication you have a lift i mean
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
you get like five pages of i believe
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
what the act what the ingredients are
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
and all the side effects when you go and
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
get an injection you get nothing you get
 
02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
the shot that's it
 
02:24:13.270 --> 02:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
and possible
 
02:24:15.270 --> 02:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
may be a list of side effects
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
but i may be wrong regarding the
 
02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:22.870 align:start position:0%
but i may be wrong regarding the
medications

02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
medications
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
02:24:27.429 --> 02:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question was really if you
 
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
were if somebody was a hospital patient
 
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
and they were given medication orally
 
02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:32.389 align:start position:0%
and they were given medication orally
then

02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
i think it would really
 
02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
might be the same situation
 
02:24:36.399 --> 02:24:37.270 align:start position:0%
might be the same situation
um

02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
as an injection um another question i
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
have do you know
 
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
this is alluding to representative
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
merchants question do you know
 
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
how readily available these ingredients
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
are for
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
clinicians who are providing these
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
medications and practically speaking
 
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
what will it take to make this bill work
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it is my
 
02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
understanding that the pharmaceutical
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
companies have to provide
 
02:25:12.469 --> 02:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
the ingredients to
 
02:25:13.990 --> 02:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
the people that they're selling their
 
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
the people that they're selling their
product

02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
shame on us
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
but i do believe that is happening and
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
this bill and i'll allude to your
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
question uh regarding taking oral
 
02:25:31.270 --> 02:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
medications in a hospital
 
02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:32.790 align:start position:0%
medications in a hospital
um

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're absolutely correct you
 
02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
don't know what's in those and we're
 
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
just take those upon faith and i can
 
02:25:40.150 --> 02:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
tell you from personal experience that
 
02:25:43.349 --> 02:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
after having an emergency surgery
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
my recovery period was hindered by some
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the medication that i was given
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
and i had no idea what was in that
 
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
so going forward i wouldn't even know
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
where to begin to look at something that
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:06.950 --> 02:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative merchant asked my
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
welcome representative woods
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you uh
 
02:26:16.710 --> 02:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh the first i have two and i'll ask
 
02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up if i can uh line seven
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
it says any health care provider who
 
02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:27.270 align:start position:0%
it says any health care provider who
recommends

02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
recommends
 
02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:28.150 align:start position:0%
recommends
or

02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:29.510 align:start position:0%
or
administers

02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
administers
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking about the practicalities
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
um uh you come to my office um and uh
 
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
you have a particular condition
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
and uh the treatment modalities are such
 
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
that um you need a particular uh
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
injectable which i don't have but i know
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
one of my uh colleagues
 
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
has that and so i recommend that you go
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have the medication i don't do
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
the injection
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
but that puts an onus on me
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
just by virtue of recommending
 
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
could you comment on how that would play
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
question uh the reason i put down
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
recommend in there was because when i go
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
to the doctors
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
and they say hey you know it we'd like
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
to give you this shot and my question is
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
is well what's in it
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
and they're just recommending that i
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
take it they're not telling me i have to
 
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
take it
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
but they're recommending it
 
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
and before i can make an informative
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
decision i want to know what's in that
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
product it's kind of like when i look at
 
02:27:40.469 --> 02:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
food i read the labels because i want to
 
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
02:27:44.550 --> 02:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
i want to know what i'm eating
 
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
so that is why the word recommend is
 
02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:48.550 align:start position:0%
so that is why the word recommend is
there

02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand
 
02:27:55.270 --> 02:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
the concern and i agree that you should
 
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
be able to do that
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
however again just reflecting
 
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
i may not have that information
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh and the the individual who would give
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
you the shot
 
02:28:05.439 --> 02:28:06.309 align:start position:0%
you the shot
um

02:28:06.309 --> 02:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
would have that so i i i i have some
 
02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
trouble with that the sec the second
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
part of the uh
 
02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:16.790 align:start position:0%
part of the uh
um

02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:18.309 --> 02:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
lost my train of thought here for a
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
second uh uh carry on i'll think of it
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
in a second
 
02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:26.790 align:start position:0%
in a second
[Music]

02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
we will come back to you if you wish
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and just as a quick follow-up
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
to representative woods um first line of
 
02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:38.710 align:start position:0%
to representative woods um first line of
inquiry

02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about the
 
02:28:44.630 --> 02:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
administration side
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
when the administration is done by
 
02:28:47.359 --> 02:28:49.190 align:start position:0%
when the administration is done by
somebody

02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i had my arm jabbed last week by
 
02:28:54.389 --> 02:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
a member of the national guard who
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't know or have access to
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
the ingredients
 
02:29:01.510 --> 02:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
in a particular shot
 
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
but is perfectly capable of
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
administering a shot
 
02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
administering a shot
under

02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
you know certain supervised conditions
 
02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:08.950 align:start position:0%
you know certain supervised conditions
so

02:29:08.950 --> 02:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you could be thinking
 
02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
about a way of dealing with the fact
 
02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
that some of the people not only do some
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the people who recommend the shots
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
not have the information but some of the
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
people who administer the shots may also
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
not have the administ
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
the information and i don't know how to
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
fix that but i thought maybe you might
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
want to think about it a bit thank you
 
02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and i understand your
 
02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:37.110 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and i understand your
concern

02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:38.070 align:start position:0%
concern
um

02:29:38.070 --> 02:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
but if the shots are being
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh handed out to
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
say the person that's administering it
 
02:29:46.469 --> 02:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
why couldn't the pharmaceutical company
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
send a list of ingredient sheets with
 
02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:49.590 align:start position:0%
send a list of ingredient sheets with
those

02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh injectables along
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
copies could be made
 
02:29:55.439 --> 02:29:59.590 align:start position:0%
copies could be made
follow-up

02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
my concern is that
 
02:30:05.190 --> 02:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
that could happen but the bill does not
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
require that to happen the bill requires
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
somebody else to do something with
 
02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
information that they might not have so
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you could just think
 
02:30:16.309 --> 02:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
about ways of perhaps
 
02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying that whole process thank you
 
02:30:21.670 --> 02:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and i will certainly give it a
 
02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:22.710 align:start position:0%
thank you and i will certainly give it a
look

02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
look
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
representative woods are you back with
 
02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
your second question i i tickled my bet
 
02:30:29.110 --> 02:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
cells and uh
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
they reconnected
 
02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh representative i'm
 
02:30:36.150 --> 02:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
getting uh uh carrying on with uh the uh
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
comment from uh uh representative
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
shapiro um in the emergency room um
 
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
let's let's pretend that it's two in the
 
02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:45.590 align:start position:0%
let's let's pretend that it's two in the
morning

02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
and in the process of uh ongoing
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
treatment which may have started six
 
02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
hours before
 
02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh you need an injection of such
 
02:30:57.270 --> 02:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
and such and you inquire
 
02:30:57.280 --> 02:30:59.190 align:start position:0%
and such and you inquire
um

02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
that creates an issue
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:31:04.870 --> 02:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's different pharmacies uh i mean
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh different uh providers for the same
 
02:31:12.309 --> 02:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh item and uh the um preservatives uh
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
and what are called the vehicles
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
are different for those preparations
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
however when it goes to the hospital
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go
 
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
down to the emergency room all the
 
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
emergency room is gets all they get is
 
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
the vial
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
insert information that you're talking
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
about that you get when you get a
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
prescription at the pharmacy is not
 
02:31:34.960 --> 02:31:36.150 align:start position:0%
prescription at the pharmacy is not
there

02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:31:37.349 --> 02:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
now we're at two in the morning
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
and you need some uh injectable
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
um and you inquire
 
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
this may delay uh for some time uh maybe
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
hours uh until that information uh is
 
02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:52.790 align:start position:0%
hours uh until that information uh is
available

02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
um is there some way and again
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative weber alluded to this as
 
02:31:57.920 --> 02:31:58.790 align:start position:0%
representative weber alluded to this as
well

02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
that we could rethink this
 
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
and maybe clarify how this plays out
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
both with the
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
line 7 recommends as well as the issues
 
02:32:10.080 --> 02:32:11.270 align:start position:0%
line 7 recommends as well as the issues
in

02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
the emergency room and
 
02:32:18.389 --> 02:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know i think we can take a look at
 
02:32:27.590 --> 02:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
that but you have this is not a mandate
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
this is not mandating
 
02:32:31.910 --> 02:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
that they have to supply it to everybody
 
02:32:34.469 --> 02:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
only those people that inquire
 
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
um and for me
 
02:32:38.550 --> 02:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
i would want to know what preservatives
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
are being put injected into my body and
 
02:32:43.990 --> 02:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
for me a delay
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
is okay
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
for some people a delay may not be okay
 
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
and they may be okay with saying yep
 
02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
just give me the shot
 
02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:51.349 align:start position:0%
just give me the shot
um

02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:53.190 --> 02:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
so i think it's
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think we have to look at it from that
 
02:32:57.670 --> 02:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
perspective because not everybody
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of people are going to take
 
02:33:01.510 --> 02:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
the injection or they're going to take
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
the medicine and they don't even look at
 
02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:04.309 align:start position:0%
the medicine and they don't even look at
it

02:33:04.309 --> 02:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
i mean people buy their groceries or
 
02:33:07.910 --> 02:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
their food and they don't ever read the
 
02:33:07.920 --> 02:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
their food and they don't ever read the
label

02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
label
 
02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:09.910 align:start position:0%
label
um

02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
but there is a certain set of the
 
02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
population where it's very important
 
02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:14.630 align:start position:0%
population where it's very important
because

02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
of bad reactions that they have had
 
02:33:19.830 --> 02:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh in the past and i think that's
 
02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:25.270 align:start position:0%
uh in the past and i think that's
important

02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not i know that doesn't probably
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
answer the question
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
but i don't have a
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:39.190 --> 02:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
and this is uh
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
a little bit complicated but as you know
 
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
we have an academic medical center in
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire at dartmouth
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
and they do medical research there
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that is done in
 
02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
medical research facilities is we have
 
02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
double-blind studies
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
where we try to find out if a new
 
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
medication works or not
 
02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
and what happens is people who sign up
 
02:34:10.710 --> 02:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
for these studies either get
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
what's being studied or they get what's
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
called a placebo and nobody on the team
 
02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
and the patient doesn't know which one
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
they get until the results are collated
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
at the end and then they can figure out
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
whether this medication is actually a
 
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
useful medication to bring further
 
02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:26.550 align:start position:0%
useful medication to bring further
forward

02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's the intent here to break the code
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
so that if somebody in the study asks
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
which arm am i in
 
02:34:35.030 --> 02:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
you have to tell them
 
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
or should we make an exception for
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:43.190 --> 02:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i believe
 
02:34:46.150 --> 02:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
that if somebody wants to be part of
 
02:34:48.389 --> 02:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
a test group then an exception should be
 
02:34:48.399 --> 02:34:50.469 align:start position:0%
a test group then an exception should be
made

02:34:50.469 --> 02:34:50.479 align:start position:0%
made
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:53.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:34:55.590 --> 02:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman thank
 
02:34:58.309 --> 02:34:58.319 align:start position:0%
you very much uh representative contour
 
02:35:02.070 --> 02:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
for my questions uh would you be
 
02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
like would you like to amend
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
to address these many issues
 
02:35:10.150 --> 02:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm seeing several
 
02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:11.110 align:start position:0%
um i'm seeing several
whereas

02:35:11.110 --> 02:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
mentioning active and inactive
 
02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:15.110 align:start position:0%
mentioning active and inactive
ingredients

02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
ingredients
 
02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:16.230 align:start position:0%
ingredients
um

02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
how to give a list to a person who
 
02:35:21.670 --> 02:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
requests like do we want to say
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
they can request a hard copy because we
 
02:35:26.309 --> 02:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
don't want to say oh sure here's the
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
link to it you can go home and read it
 
02:35:29.439 --> 02:35:30.469 align:start position:0%
link to it you can go home and read it
um

02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:32.309 --> 02:35:32.319 align:start position:0%
if people need
 
02:35:34.469 --> 02:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
like would you consider
 
02:35:34.479 --> 02:35:36.309 align:start position:0%
like would you consider
um

02:35:36.309 --> 02:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
expecting the supply the
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
provider who is providing the
 
02:35:42.319 --> 02:35:43.910 align:start position:0%
provider who is providing the
medication

02:35:43.910 --> 02:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
medication
 
02:35:44.950 --> 02:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
would they
 
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
a printer
 
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
handy so that online they could
 
02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:52.710 align:start position:0%
handy so that online they could
just

02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
just asked to print it
 
02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
just as needed they wouldn't have to
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
have a stack of papers to hand out but
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
they would have access to a file online
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
that they could as requested
 
02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:09.110 align:start position:0%
that they could as requested
um

02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
it sounds you know are you interested in
 
02:36:13.349 --> 02:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
amending so that we can address all
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and yes i would
 
02:36:20.070 --> 02:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
be uh very interested in that and
 
02:36:22.070 --> 02:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
interested in working with the committee
 
02:36:26.469 --> 02:36:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative compost for taking my
 
02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
question would would we be able to
 
02:36:39.270 --> 02:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
satisfy the need
 
02:36:41.270 --> 02:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh for the information you require with
 
02:36:43.030 --> 02:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
an online
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh look up on the internet and and i
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
asked that because
 
02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
my daughter is a formulation
 
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
bioscientist for pfizer and the
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
information associated with the pfizer
 
02:36:57.830 --> 02:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine for kovit is is all listed on
 
02:36:57.840 --> 02:36:58.870 align:start position:0%
vaccine for kovit is is all listed on
the

02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:00.230 align:start position:0%
the
internet

02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
internet
 
02:37:00.240 --> 02:37:01.349 align:start position:0%
internet
including

02:37:01.349 --> 02:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
multiple depth of information as
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
required by the fda and other
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
organizations around the world so the
 
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
information is readily available
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
by manufacturer and would that satisfy
 
02:37:16.710 --> 02:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
the need
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking uh
 
02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
for the question so i did i looked up
 
02:37:23.750 --> 02:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
the fights of the vaccine for pfizer and
 
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct all the active
 
02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
and inactive ingredients are listed
 
02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:29.110 align:start position:0%
and inactive ingredients are listed
however

02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:37:31.030 --> 02:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
when i looked up tetanus booster or
 
02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
tetanus shot
 
02:37:36.550 --> 02:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
there was uh several manufacturers and
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
only some of the active ingredients were
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
listed the inactive gradients were not
 
02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:44.790 align:start position:0%
listed the inactive gradients were not
so

02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
so to answer your questions that unless
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
we knew
 
02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
we knew
what

02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
was right there and the other the other
 
02:37:54.790 --> 02:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
question is if we can't get a list
 
02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
when they want to give us the shots
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
then it's going to make a delay where if
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
you had a printout or something to look
 
02:38:04.630 --> 02:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
at on a screen in the in the doctor's
 
02:38:06.469 --> 02:38:06.479 align:start position:0%
office you would see those ingredients
 
02:38:06.479 --> 02:38:11.590 align:start position:0%
office you would see those ingredients
immediately

02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:17.349 --> 02:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
very much um
 
02:38:19.349 --> 02:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
representative woods laid out a scenario
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
a little while ago about
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
two in the morning in the emergency room
 
02:38:26.070 --> 02:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
um and you made a comment that you
 
02:38:27.910 --> 02:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't mind if your treatment
 
02:38:29.750 --> 02:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
was delayed but would you agree that in
 
02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
a busy emergency room or
 
02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
provider's office
 
02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:36.630 align:start position:0%
provider's office
that

02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:38:38.710 --> 02:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
this will delay
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
these kinds of activities might not just
 
02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
delay the care of the person that
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
requests but the care of other people
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
are waiting to be taken care of
 
02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
and that maybe there might be better
 
02:38:50.550 --> 02:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
ways to transmit this information
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
what you're saying and there may be some
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
delays but i don't think the delays
 
02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
would be that great
 
02:39:01.359 --> 02:39:02.469 align:start position:0%
would be that great
um

02:39:02.469 --> 02:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:02.479 --> 02:39:04.150 align:start position:0%
um
because

02:39:04.150 --> 02:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
as i've said
 
02:39:06.630 --> 02:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:39:09.349 --> 02:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's inactive ingredients
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
or even some of the active ingredients
 
02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
that you might know have an adverse
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
effect on you
 
02:39:14.479 --> 02:39:15.750 align:start position:0%
effect on you
and

02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
the doctor might not realize that or the
 
02:39:20.230 --> 02:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
person giving it might not realize that
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
and it so it is to the health of the
 
02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:24.389 align:start position:0%
and it so it is to the health of the
patient

02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative nelson
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:39:38.550 --> 02:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question do
 
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know if they would list a scientific
 
02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:41.750 align:start position:0%
you know if they would list a scientific
name

02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
name
 
02:39:44.070 --> 02:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
versus an everyday name uh you know i'll
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
use uh wheat i don't know if there's a
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
scientific name for wheat you know which
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:54.309 --> 02:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and i didn't
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
get i i understand what you're saying
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
because really some of the names are
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
really tough to uh discern uh for the
 
02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
layperson but i wasn't going to go into
 
02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
the weeds with all of this i was just
 
02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
asking for a list of the active and
 
02:40:09.590 --> 02:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
inactive ingredients
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:17.270 --> 02:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:40:19.270 --> 02:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
02:40:23.510 --> 02:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
um if i go back to the issue about food
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
if i buy the food in the grocery store
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
it of course has a list of what's in
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
the container of the product i'm buying
 
02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
however if i go to a restaurant i don't
 
02:40:33.910 --> 02:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
have in the menu manual list of all the
 
02:40:35.349 --> 02:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
things that are in the food products
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
that the chef used to prepare
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
the meal what i'd be concerned about and
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the root here is if i
 
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
had a peanut allergy i would inform the
 
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
staff at the restaurant i have a peanut
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
allergy and ask them
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
does the food that you're serving me
 
02:40:51.750 --> 02:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
have any peanuts in it or any nut
 
02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
contain it so it puts the illness back
 
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
onto the restaurant to at that point in
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
time ensure that
 
02:40:59.510 --> 02:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
if i have an allergy to a peanut or to
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
something of whatever the food may be
 
02:41:03.670 --> 02:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
the restaurant's informed about that and
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
they have to make the decision that the
 
02:41:07.030 --> 02:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
food or what they're providing to me is
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
not going to contain something i'm
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
allergic to
 
02:41:11.110 --> 02:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
would that be something amenable to in
 
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
saying that if you tell the provider i
 
02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
have an allergy
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
to something
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
that will cause a problem harm to the
 
02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:19.990 align:start position:0%
that will cause a problem harm to the
patient

02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
patient
 
02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
that the provider then is informed and
 
02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
the provider has to make the
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
determination the product they're going
 
02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
to give to you is in fact
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
void of that particular chemical
 
02:41:32.469 --> 02:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:41:32.479 --> 02:41:34.870 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
and

02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:37.349 --> 02:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
going out to dinner is an option
 
02:41:39.990 --> 02:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
getting an injection may not be
 
02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.270 align:start position:0%
getting an injection may not be
and

02:41:41.270 --> 02:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
you can choose where you go to dinner
 
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
based on the food that they provide what
 
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
you know about the restaurant and some
 
02:41:49.349 --> 02:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
restaurants do list where they're
 
02:41:51.030 --> 02:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
getting their food from
 
02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh they actually list where the farms
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
that it's being brought from
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
if you are so inclined to uh go to those
 
02:41:58.319 --> 02:41:59.429 align:start position:0%
if you are so inclined to uh go to those
places

02:41:59.429 --> 02:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
places
 
02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
a choice we're talking about something
 
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
that somebody wants to administer into
 
02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
your body
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
that's not it
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
i mean i have rejected injections
 
02:42:12.550 --> 02:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
because i don't know what's in them my
 
02:42:14.469 --> 02:42:14.479 align:start position:0%
doctor keeps insisting i need it but
 
02:42:16.710 --> 02:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
until i can get that lift i am not
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
taking that injection
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
so it may be to the detriment to my
 
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
health but that's okay with me because i
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
i see representative nelson's hand is up
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
i no longer see it but i
 
02:42:44.070 --> 02:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
do see representative marsh
 
02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh yes this is another question
 
02:42:48.469 --> 02:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think about how the spill
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
might affect other products and one of
 
02:42:53.429 --> 02:42:53.439 align:start position:0%
the things that we have seen in medicine
 
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
is we've seen a huge infla increase in
 
02:42:57.270 --> 02:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
the number of conditions that can be
 
02:43:00.150 --> 02:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
treated uh due to biological products
 
02:43:02.630 --> 02:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
that are available we've debated bills
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
about biosimilars in this committee in
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
the past and one of the things that the
 
02:43:09.510 --> 02:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
fda tells us about biologics is that
 
02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
they aren't like drugs where they're
 
02:43:13.429 --> 02:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
manufactured from ingredients but they
 
02:43:16.469 --> 02:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
uh they they compare the
 
02:43:18.950 --> 02:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
biological activity of these things that
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
are being manufactured so i'm not sure
 
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
that the ingredients are actually even
 
02:43:26.550 --> 02:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
known for uh biologicals uh and i'm
 
02:43:29.270 --> 02:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
my question is have you considered uh
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
such products in this bill or should we
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
just make an exception for that
 
02:43:37.590 --> 02:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative and no i i
 
02:43:40.230 --> 02:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
did not consider that i am
 
02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:41.590 align:start position:0%
did not consider that i am
not

02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:43:44.469 --> 02:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
a doctor or in in the medical field at
 
02:43:46.389 --> 02:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
all so i was not even
 
02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh i didn't really look into that at all
 
02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:50.389 align:start position:0%
uh i didn't really look into that at all
so

02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:54.630 --> 02:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
02:43:56.230 --> 02:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:44:01.110 --> 02:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
again uh um could you help me out uh
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
could you give me an example of
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
something that might be listed in an
 
02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:06.070 align:start position:0%
something that might be listed in an
injection

02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
injection
 
02:44:08.550 --> 02:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
that would catch your eye
 
02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:11.429 align:start position:0%
that would
precipitate

02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
precipitate
 
02:44:12.469 --> 02:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
a no
 
02:44:15.670 --> 02:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
for an injection i'm i'm kind of curious
 
02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
i thank you for the question and no i
 
02:44:19.510 --> 02:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
cannot because i've never actually been
 
02:44:21.190 --> 02:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
given a list of anything that's been
 
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
given to me or when i was in the
 
02:44:25.030 --> 02:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
hospital for emergency surgery given a
 
02:44:26.469 --> 02:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
list of any of those
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh medications that were given to me
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i don't know i couldn't tell you
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
which ingredients
 
02:44:38.550 --> 02:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
follow up yes yeah thank you um
 
02:44:43.990 --> 02:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
is there a class of
 
02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
chemicals that you would be looking for
 
02:44:49.110 --> 02:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
is there any indicator
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
at all that as you
 
02:44:53.750 --> 02:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
interact with the provider that's going
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
to give this injection that you know
 
02:44:57.750 --> 02:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
ahead of time like a peanut allergy is
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:04.469 --> 02:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
is there something that you are looking
 
02:45:04.479 --> 02:45:05.990 align:start position:0%
is there something that you are looking
for

02:45:05.990 --> 02:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:45:07.830 --> 02:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative no there is
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
nothing specific that i'm looking for i
 
02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
just think that it is
 
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
the patient's right
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
to know what's being injected into their
 
02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:16.630 align:start position:0%
to know what's being injected into their
body

02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
body
 
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
i think we as consumers want to know
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
what we're eating in our food and we
 
02:45:22.870 --> 02:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
demand that labels are put on our food
 
02:45:24.630 --> 02:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
so that we know
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
what's in that
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
and what is the difference between
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
consuming something and having something
 
02:45:31.269 --> 02:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
injected into you
 
02:45:32.950 --> 02:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you want to know what's
 
02:45:34.790 --> 02:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
being injected into you versus what
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:50.630 --> 02:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none the chair calls on nick
 
02:45:50.640 --> 02:45:52.309 align:start position:0%
seeing none the chair calls on nick
dougherty

02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
dougherty
 
02:45:54.389 --> 02:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
he's from boston
 
02:45:57.670 --> 02:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
and the home of the champion red sox
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%

and he is signed in in opposition to the
 
02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:06.790 align:start position:0%
and he is signed in in opposition to the
bill

02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:46:08.309 --> 02:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh mr door
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure can everyone
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
hear me
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
okay perfect
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you for having me today uh
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
as mentioned my name is nick doherty i'm
 
02:46:19.750 --> 02:46:19.760 align:start position:0%

healthier and more productive lives
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
since 2000 farmer member companies have
 
02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
invested nearly 1 trillion dollars in
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
the search for new treatment and cures
 
02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
including an estimated 83 billion in

opportunity to listen to the discussion
 
02:46:57.190 --> 02:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh with the committee it's been very
 
02:46:59.429 --> 02:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
informative um and also gave me an
 
02:47:00.710 --> 02:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
02:47:03.510 --> 02:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
to uh search the internet um
 
02:47:06.870 --> 02:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
during the discussion um now i am here
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
to testify in opposition to house bill
 
02:47:11.910 --> 02:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
146 and that is because pharma believes
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary and also may be
 
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
preempted by
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
existing federal law under the federal
 
02:47:21.269 --> 02:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
food drug and cosmetic act
 
02:47:22.950 --> 02:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
the statement that we did submit to the
 
02:47:25.269 --> 02:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
committee provides a lot more detail of
 
02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:27.439 align:start position:0%
the federal laws already in place that
 
02:47:29.190 --> 02:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
address ingredients on prescription
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
labels and for the sake of time
 
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
and just
 
02:47:33.510 --> 02:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
in response to some of the questions
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'll try to adjust address the general
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
ideas here
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
so the fdca regulations already require
 
02:47:44.630 --> 02:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
drug labels to identify each active and
 
02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
inactive ingredients on a label
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
any label that does not conform to these
 
02:47:51.429 --> 02:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
requirements would be considered
 
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
misbranded and subject to fda
 
02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:55.429 align:start position:0%
misbranded and subject to fda
enforcement

02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
now the fdca regulations also expressly
 
02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
include exceptions for listing inactive
 
02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:02.870 align:start position:0%
include exceptions for listing inactive
ingredients

02:48:02.870 --> 02:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
ingredients
 
02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
result in divulging trade secrets and
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
when it's just trace amounts of harmless
 
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
substances that are added for
 
02:48:12.230 --> 02:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
identification of the product
 
02:48:14.710 --> 02:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
now because house bill 146 does not
 
02:48:17.710 --> 02:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
contain a parallel exception to either
 
02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
fdca requirements
 
02:48:21.990 --> 02:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
this proposal would create a conflict
 
02:48:24.070 --> 02:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
between the state and federal law
 
02:48:26.309 --> 02:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
which is the reason why we believe it
 
02:48:28.830 --> 02:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
would be preempted by existing federal
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
law but in addition to the preemption
 
02:48:33.190 --> 02:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
issues and i think this is where a lot
 
02:48:35.830 --> 02:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
of the conversation was happening today
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
there are two websites where this
 
02:48:40.790 --> 02:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
information could be found the
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
ingredient information both active and
 
02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
inactive could be found online
 
02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
the first one is the nih
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
daily med database
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
so this would allow anyone while i was
 
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
sitting here i was i did search a couple
 
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
of my medicines to see if they were on
 
02:48:59.590 --> 02:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
there so anyone from patients caregivers
 
02:49:01.429 --> 02:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
health care providers and members of the
 
02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
public can search
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
in a number of different ways it's
 
02:49:06.550 --> 02:49:06.560 align:start position:0%
either by drug
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
by the national drug code so every drug
 
02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
has an ndc
 
02:49:14.230 --> 02:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
or by drug class or by a set id
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that is i believe it was rep nelson
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
asked the question about how you could
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
search so scientific name would be one
 
02:49:21.040 --> 02:49:21.830 align:start position:0%
search so scientific name would be one
way

02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:49:24.710 --> 02:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
or or ndc which is uh
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
on every bottle or or information that
 
02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
is provided to a patient
 
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh and then the other way to do this on
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
the fda website there's also a database
 
02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
that allows for searches by both active
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
and inactive ingredients
 
02:49:40.710 --> 02:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons we are opposed to
 
02:49:42.630 --> 02:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
the bill i'm happy to take any questions
 
02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh from any of the committee members uh
 
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
to try to provide further information
 
02:49:51.750 --> 02:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
i have a question mr dougherty this is
 
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
the chairman mark pearson um if the
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
search on the websites that you
 
02:49:59.269 --> 02:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned um
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
i believe you i've never done it but i i
 
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
believe you then it shouldn't be very
 
02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
difficult for somebody in a doctor's
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
office to do the same when a patient
 
02:50:11.349 --> 02:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
wants uh something injected should it
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
correct so the the doctor would be able
 
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
to sit at their desk or on a smartphone
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
and and go to that website and and um
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
in search
 
02:50:24.070 --> 02:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
based on an nbc
 
02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else from the committee
 
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
somebody's saying
 
02:50:37.590 --> 02:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
um i see it looks like representative
 
02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:39.750 align:start position:0%
um i see it looks like representative
kanark

02:50:39.750 --> 02:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
kanark
 
02:50:42.389 --> 02:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr daugherty would you then
 
02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
agree that if a person has a specific
 
02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:45.910 align:start position:0%
agree that if a person has a specific
concern

02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:50:47.590 --> 02:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
that it would be less cumbersome on a
 
02:50:49.429 --> 02:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
practice for them to go seek this
 
02:50:51.269 --> 02:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
information at the websites you've
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
quoted rather than to ask a provider who
 
02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
then has to
 
02:50:57.590 --> 02:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
stop the work in their office to look up
 
02:50:59.429 --> 02:50:59.439 align:start position:0%
this information and provide it to the
 
02:51:01.429 --> 02:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
patient would that be a more efficient
 
02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
way for this for a given person who's
 
02:51:05.670 --> 02:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
worried to find that information
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
i i can't speak to which would be more
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
efficient but the the opportunity would
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
be available in either way uh always a
 
02:51:14.870 --> 02:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
fan of having multiple bites at the
 
02:51:17.030 --> 02:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
apple so it could be a review in the
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
doctor's office or the care
 
02:51:20.710 --> 02:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
the patient could look on their own or
 
02:51:23.429 --> 02:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
have a parental guardian or caregiver
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:33.910 --> 02:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see a yellow hand but i see a
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
a larger hand from mr acton
 
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative acton do you have a
 
02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you mr chairman
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
because i'm in the host mode i i can't
 
02:51:44.950 --> 02:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
seem to raise my hand so i'll
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
put my own big hand up there but anyway
 
02:51:47.040 --> 02:51:47.660 align:start position:0%
put my own big hand up there but anyway
uh

02:51:47.660 --> 02:51:47.670 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:49.110 align:start position:0%
uh
[Applause]

02:51:49.110 --> 02:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
02:51:51.990 --> 02:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh mr dory couldn't this be handled as
 
02:51:54.070 --> 02:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
simply as as the industry creates a
 
02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
clearinghouse of
 
02:51:57.349 --> 02:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
an online database of all this
 
02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
information and simply just hand the
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
person who asks a business card that
 
02:52:04.150 --> 02:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
gives them login information and then
 
02:52:05.429 --> 02:52:05.439 align:start position:0%
provide them that
 
02:52:07.030 --> 02:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
provide them all the data they want
 
02:52:09.510 --> 02:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
isn't it could it be that simple
 
02:52:12.070 --> 02:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
you don't even need login information uh
 
02:52:15.190 --> 02:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
i just this is a public website um that
 
02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
anyone can log into uh in the testimony
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
that we included
 
02:52:21.910 --> 02:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
you can click uh in the link click
 
02:52:23.190 --> 02:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
click the website and it'll bring you
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
directly to the location where you can
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
look up
 
02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
any drug based upon you know the class
 
02:52:31.750 --> 02:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
the ndc or an id number so it's not not
 
02:52:33.190 --> 02:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
anything that's exclusive to the
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers it's it's publicly
 
02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:38.950 align:start position:0%
manufacturers it's it's publicly
available

02:52:38.950 --> 02:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:44.550 --> 02:52:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:46.870 --> 02:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman but uh
 
02:52:48.309 --> 02:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
asked the question
 
02:52:53.429 --> 02:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
a representative gay
 
02:52:57.190 --> 02:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir thank you for taking my
 
02:53:00.070 --> 02:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
question what exactly is the website
 
02:53:03.269 --> 02:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
name that has the nbc class scientific
 
02:53:05.429 --> 02:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
name etc
 
02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
so if you were to look at the uh
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that we presented it's the nih
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%

hampshire
 
02:54:41.990 --> 02:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm a resident of salem new
 
02:54:43.590 --> 02:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm speaking on behalf of
 
02:54:47.269 --> 02:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
myself today in opposition of hb 146.
 
02:54:49.510 --> 02:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
i posit to you that the potential harm
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to protect against which
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
is if i'm interpreting right the
 
02:54:55.830 --> 02:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
administration of an injectable
 
02:54:57.910 --> 02:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical without providing
 
02:54:59.830 --> 02:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
information as requested by the patient
 
02:55:01.429 --> 02:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
or patient's proxy
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
that this is already protected against
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
we are bound by our vocation as
 
02:55:07.510 --> 02:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers to act ethically in
 
02:55:09.349 --> 02:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
the care of our patients
 
02:55:11.910 --> 02:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
if that binding does not suffice
 
02:55:13.269 --> 02:55:13.279 align:start position:0%
we are also bound to the new hampshire
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
board of medicine to abide by the rules
 
02:55:17.030 --> 02:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the board and as referenced by the
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
board the american medical association
 
02:55:20.790 --> 02:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
code of ethics
 
02:55:23.429 --> 02:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately an autonomous patient can
 
02:55:25.750 --> 02:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
agree to treatment or decline it
 
02:55:28.469 --> 02:55:28.479 align:start position:0%
and after discussion with the provider
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
and after requesting any information
 
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
that is additional it follows that the
 
02:55:35.110 --> 02:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
request is integral to the decision it's
 
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
important to the patient and so we
 
02:55:39.670 --> 02:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
providers provide it
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
furthermore uh by federal law from 1986
 
02:55:43.830 --> 02:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
we furnish at every vaccine
 
02:55:46.389 --> 02:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
administration a vis or vaccine
 
02:55:47.910 --> 02:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
information statement
 
02:55:50.230 --> 02:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
notably i'm sure the officers are aware
 
02:55:52.150 --> 02:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
this does not include ingredients
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
however even though it's not in the vis
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
we still provide it when asked because
 
02:55:59.030 --> 02:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
our patient expressed that it's
 
02:56:01.269 --> 02:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
important to them in their decision
 
02:56:03.910 --> 02:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
i was trained at what was for 20 years
 
02:56:05.590 --> 02:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
the only family medicine residency in
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:56:08.309 --> 02:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that we are trained to
 
02:56:10.150 --> 02:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
answer patient questions
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
it would not for example be good care if
 
02:56:15.429 --> 02:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
a patient asked me for information and i
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
declined to provide it while continuing
 
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
to then go on to administer the
 
02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:20.870 align:start position:0%
to then go on to administer the
treatment

02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:56:22.710 --> 02:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to my care for a panel of
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
2200 patients and my experience in an
 
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
office that cares for nearly 17 000
 
02:56:29.429 --> 02:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
granite staters
 
02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
i have not seen any account of refusing
 
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
patients information when requested in
 
02:56:35.429 --> 02:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
this manner
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
through my involvement with organized
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
medicine in the state i have also not
 
02:56:40.550 --> 02:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
seen any report that this is happening
 
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
on any larger scale as well
 
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
additionally the regulatory burden that
 
02:56:46.230 --> 02:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
this imposes
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
for a harm that is to me neither
 
02:56:50.389 --> 02:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
apparent nor on the horizon
 
02:56:52.550 --> 02:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
is high and it poses the potential for
 
02:56:54.870 --> 02:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
more burden i can furnish the list of
 
02:56:56.710 --> 02:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
ingredients and i already do when i'm
 
02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:57.670 align:start position:0%
ingredients and i already do when i'm
asked

02:56:57.670 --> 02:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
asked
 
02:57:00.070 --> 02:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
they come with the pharmaceuticals
 
02:57:02.230 --> 02:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
they are also widely available as we've
 
02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:03.030 align:start position:0%
they are also widely available as we've
heard

02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
keeping paper copies of any list will
 
02:57:07.269 --> 02:57:07.279 align:start position:0%
take time updating and vaccines and
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
injectable medications are also
 
02:57:10.870 --> 02:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
administered beyond the auspices of a
 
02:57:12.389 --> 02:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
provider's office
 
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
furthermore i'd like to have
 
02:57:17.349 --> 02:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
in consideration that i'm under no such
 
02:57:19.030 --> 02:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
requirement to furnish a list of all
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
medication ingredients for other
 
02:57:22.550 --> 02:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals we discussed the active
 
02:57:22.560 --> 02:57:23.830 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals we discussed the active
ingredient

02:57:23.830 --> 02:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
ingredient
 
02:57:25.830 --> 02:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
but this has also been addressed already
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
by the representatives thus far with
 
02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
regards to pharmacy administration but
 
02:57:31.110 --> 02:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
there was the point raised about
 
02:57:32.469 --> 02:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
hospital administration of oral
 
02:57:32.479 --> 02:57:33.830 align:start position:0%
hospital administration of oral
medications

02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
medications
 
02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
the last and potentially most important
 
02:57:37.510 --> 02:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
arguments i would make are those of
 
02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
patient autonomy and the paramount
 
02:57:41.269 --> 02:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
importance of the patient provider
 
02:57:41.279 --> 02:57:42.710 align:start position:0%
importance of the patient provider
relationship

02:57:42.710 --> 02:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
02:57:45.750 --> 02:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
to me there should be a material need to
 
02:57:48.150 --> 02:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
insert government into the medical exam
 
02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
room to make mandatory policies that
 
02:57:53.590 --> 02:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
would impact the care a patient receives
 
02:57:55.429 --> 02:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
at status quo patients and their
 
02:57:57.990 --> 02:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
providers discuss treatments the content
 
02:57:59.990 --> 02:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
of those discussions is part of the
 
02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
beauty and the bedrock of medical
 
02:58:03.910 --> 02:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
practice based in the inherent autonomy
 
02:58:05.030 --> 02:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
of the patient
 
02:58:06.790 --> 02:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
the health care decisions that arise
 
02:58:09.110 --> 02:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
come from shared decision-making models
 
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
between the patient and their designated
 
02:58:12.790 --> 02:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
medical professional
 
02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
and for me when government inserts
 
02:58:16.230 --> 02:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
itself into that practice there should
 
02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
be a very clear need and for me when i
 
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
look at this when patients request
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
information they should receive the
 
02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
information based under the current
 
02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory paradigms that exist and so
 
02:58:28.870 --> 02:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
because of that i speak in opposition of
 
02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
hb 146 and i thank everybody for their
 
02:58:31.439 --> 02:58:33.910 align:start position:0%
hb 146 and i thank everybody for their
time

02:58:33.910 --> 02:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:36.389 --> 02:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
will you take questions
 
02:58:36.399 --> 02:58:42.389 align:start position:0%
will you take questions
yes

02:58:42.389 --> 02:58:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:43.990 --> 02:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
while others decide if they have
 
02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:45.590 align:start position:0%
while others decide if they have
questions

02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:58:48.550 --> 02:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
i have a semi question
 
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
that is i dropped
 
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
a primary care physician as mine
 
02:58:58.469 --> 02:58:58.479 align:start position:0%
because the doc in the box facility in
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
which he worked made him see so many
 
02:59:03.750 --> 02:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
patients per day
 
02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
the questions were not encouraged
 
02:59:08.469 --> 02:59:08.479 align:start position:0%
oh there's nothing that i could quote in
 
02:59:11.429 --> 02:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit that is very apparent he
 
02:59:13.190 --> 02:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have time he was not allowed to
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
have time
 
02:59:17.190 --> 02:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
to answer questions such as what's in
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
this medicine you've prescribed me
 
02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
and while
 
02:59:23.670 --> 02:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
i very much am
 
02:59:25.590 --> 02:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
in favor of keeping government out of
 
02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
things as much as possible
 
02:59:30.230 --> 02:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
i had a bad experience which is why i
 
02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
left that primary care person i've heard
 
02:59:35.349 --> 02:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
similar stories
 
02:59:35.359 --> 02:59:36.550 align:start position:0%
similar stories
so

02:59:36.550 --> 02:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:38.469 --> 02:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
where is my recourse there other than
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
changing pcps which is what i did
 
02:59:43.990 --> 02:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:59:47.590 --> 02:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh that is a story that we
 
02:59:49.429 --> 02:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
hear from patients i've heard it from
 
02:59:51.750 --> 02:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
patients switching to me and i i know
 
02:59:53.030 --> 02:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
that that is not unique and it's very
 
02:59:55.030 --> 02:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
hard and i'm i'm sorry for you and
 
02:59:57.190 --> 02:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
everybody who experiences that with
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
certain offices
 
03:00:01.750 --> 03:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
i would say that this is similar to any
 
03:00:04.150 --> 03:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
other course of treatment right if you
 
03:00:06.550 --> 03:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
are not comfortable with a course of
 
03:00:08.230 --> 03:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
treatment that you and your provider
 
03:00:11.110 --> 03:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
formulate through shared decision making
 
03:00:13.590 --> 03:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
then we have the right to seek
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
uh seek recourse
 
03:00:16.870 --> 03:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
elsewhere through other through other
 
03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:17.830 align:start position:0%
elsewhere through other through other
means

03:00:17.830 --> 03:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
means
 
03:00:21.190 --> 03:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
this isn't i we heard the
 
03:00:23.429 --> 03:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
gentleman who was speaking before me
 
03:00:25.349 --> 03:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
from public testimony
 
03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
had indicated that you know this
 
03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
information is out there so for me when
 
03:00:32.550 --> 03:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
patients ask it's not too hard for me to
 
03:00:34.710 --> 03:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
get that information
 
03:00:36.389 --> 03:00:36.399 align:start position:0%
i know that there are some offices that
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
offer stricter time requirements than i
 
03:00:41.269 --> 03:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
am forced to uh to comply with
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
however at the end of the day my
 
03:00:44.710 --> 03:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to my
 
03:00:47.030 --> 03:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
my oath as a physician and to my
 
03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:48.710 align:start position:0%
my oath as a physician and to my
licensure

03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
03:00:51.429 --> 03:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
as well as first and foremost my patient
 
03:00:53.349 --> 03:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
and if i was in a situation where i
 
03:00:55.510 --> 03:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to make uh good shared
 
03:00:57.910 --> 03:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
decisions with a patient i probably be
 
03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
would be looking for a different
 
03:01:05.030 --> 03:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:06.720 align:start position:0%

for example what happened at the hearing
 
03:30:51.349 --> 03:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
of the senate bill which happened last
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
week but
 
03:30:54.309 --> 03:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
i don't think for someone who knows
 
03:30:55.910 --> 03:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
who's knowledgeable about this i don't
 
03:30:57.190 --> 03:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
think there's going to be too much new

thank you uh
the

03:32:44.630 --> 03:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of house bill 220 is to
 
03:32:49.830 --> 03:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
elaborate in statute that every person
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
has their right
 
03:32:53.110 --> 03:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
to natural
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent right to bodily
 
03:32:57.670 --> 03:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
integrity and that applies to medical
 
03:32:59.750 --> 03:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
treatments and i i personally believe
 
03:33:00.790 --> 03:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
that has been implicit in the statutes
 
03:33:05.910 --> 03:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
for a long time but it makes it explicit
 
03:33:08.469 --> 03:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
in the statutes the problem with the
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill as we received it is it was rather
 
03:33:13.750 --> 03:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
unworkable for a variety of reasons
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the most obvious example
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
is when you consider how it would affect
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
the involuntary emergency admission
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
process for people who are going to be
 
03:33:25.030 --> 03:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
admitted to the mental hospital because
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
they are a threat to themselves or
 
03:33:26.560 --> 03:33:27.429 align:start position:0%
they are a threat to themselves or
others

03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
others
 
03:33:30.309 --> 03:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
clearly if it's involuntary
 
03:33:31.590 --> 03:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
that is not something that they are
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
consenting to and clearly as most of us
 
03:33:37.750 --> 03:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
know because we wrote the laws uh at
 
03:33:39.670 --> 03:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
some time uh
 
03:33:39.680 --> 03:33:40.710 align:start position:0%
some time uh
the

03:33:40.710 --> 03:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:33:42.309 --> 03:33:42.319 align:start position:0%
rights of people going through that
 
03:33:46.870 --> 03:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
process are very well protected um
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
so we need to
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
make an exception in the
 
03:33:54.710 --> 03:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
in this new statute so that those
 
03:33:56.550 --> 03:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
processes that we've already put in
 
03:33:56.560 --> 03:33:57.349 align:start position:0%
processes that we've already put in
place

03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
place
 
03:33:59.910 --> 03:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
to respect the rights of the individuals
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
involved in them
 
03:34:02.870 --> 03:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
while getting the treatment that they
 
03:34:02.880 --> 03:34:04.070 align:start position:0%
while getting the treatment that they
need

03:34:04.070 --> 03:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:34:06.309 --> 03:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
continue to work as they work at this
 
03:34:08.550 --> 03:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
point in time so we made a number of
 
03:34:10.630 --> 03:34:10.640 align:start position:0%
exceptions to this
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
we made an exception for involuntary
 
03:34:12.479 --> 03:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
we made an exception for involuntary
admissions

03:34:13.750 --> 03:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
admissions
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
we made
 
03:34:18.070 --> 03:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
an exception uh in that vaccinations are
 
03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
required as a prerequisite for
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
admissions to schools which then people
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh or their parents
 
03:34:26.469 --> 03:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
voluntarily comply with so they can
 
03:34:28.309 --> 03:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
actually go to school and go to school
 
03:34:28.319 --> 03:34:29.590 align:start position:0%
actually go to school and go to school
safely

03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
safely
 
03:34:31.349 --> 03:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
and we have made exceptions for the
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
commissioners authority to authorize to
 
03:34:36.389 --> 03:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
order treatments pursuant to the
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
infectious disease statute and also to
 
03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
the pursuant to the venereal disease
 
03:34:40.399 --> 03:34:42.870 align:start position:0%
the pursuant to the venereal disease
statute

03:34:42.870 --> 03:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
last one of the concerns of the people
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
who brought this bill before us
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
was the
 
03:34:49.120 --> 03:34:50.710 align:start position:0%
was the
um

03:34:50.710 --> 03:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
before i go to that we also have
 
03:34:54.550 --> 03:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
occasions in law where people have
 
03:34:56.710 --> 03:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
appointed guardians to make their
 
03:34:58.870 --> 03:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
clinical decisions for them and we
 
03:35:00.870 --> 03:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
needed to make an exception for that so
 
03:35:03.429 --> 03:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
that process can can continue to happen
 
03:35:05.429 --> 03:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
in the way it does now
 
03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
last one of the concerns of the people
 
03:35:09.269 --> 03:35:09.279 align:start position:0%
who brought this bill before us were
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
that they thought that they were being
 
03:35:13.990 --> 03:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
required to have certain vaccinations as
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
a condition of employment when i
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
investigated this i i
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
discovered that certain people have been
 
03:35:23.110 --> 03:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
terminated from employment for refusing
 
03:35:26.070 --> 03:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and when these cases are
 
03:35:28.469 --> 03:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
appealed on to the
 
03:35:30.389 --> 03:35:30.399 align:start position:0%
federal equal employment opportunity
 
03:35:30.399 --> 03:35:31.429 align:start position:0%
federal equal employment opportunity
commission

03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:35:33.590 --> 03:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
they're educated under
 
03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:35.190 align:start position:0%
they're educated under
a

03:35:35.190 --> 03:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
rule that's that's in federal statute
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
that i referenced at the end of this
 
03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
amendment specifically if there's not an
 
03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
immediate threat
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
that this requirement is addressing then
 
03:35:48.229 --> 03:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
they are determined to have been
 
03:35:50.710 --> 03:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
terminated without cause and receive
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate benefits there too by
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
putting that same standard into statute
 
03:35:57.030 --> 03:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to make it so people have
 
03:35:59.429 --> 03:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
the benefit of that protection without
 
03:36:00.870 --> 03:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
going through the long and drawn-out
 
03:36:03.429 --> 03:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
process and expensive process
 
03:36:05.110 --> 03:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
of appealing to the equal appointment
 
03:36:07.110 --> 03:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity commission so i i believe
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
that this amendment makes the the house
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill 220 workable um
 
03:36:15.110 --> 03:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
and uh still maintains the original
 
03:36:16.469 --> 03:36:16.479 align:start position:0%
intent of
 
03:36:17.670 --> 03:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative lang who brought it
 
03:36:19.510 --> 03:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
before us to
 
03:36:21.670 --> 03:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
make explicit in statute that people
 
03:36:23.910 --> 03:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
have the right to their own bodily
 
03:36:26.790 --> 03:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
integrity so thank you for that
 
03:36:28.870 --> 03:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative woods you have a question
 
03:36:31.190 --> 03:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
for representative marsh
 
03:36:33.269 --> 03:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
i do uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
03:36:34.870 --> 03:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative march
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
i i did pull up uh the definitions as
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
you've referred to with the cfrs
 
03:36:42.950 --> 03:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's still rather vague
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
i guess it's
 
03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to be vague i guess
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
um help me out
 
03:36:52.710 --> 03:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
i run a company
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh i've got 30 employees
 
03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh they work it's a semi manufacturing
 
03:36:57.520 --> 03:36:58.469 align:start position:0%
uh they work it's a semi manufacturing
area

03:36:58.469 --> 03:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
area
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh they're very close
 
03:37:03.990 --> 03:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh proximity to each other
 
03:37:06.910 --> 03:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing manufacturing process just
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the nature of the product
 
03:37:11.920 --> 03:37:13.269 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the nature of the product
um

03:37:13.269 --> 03:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
an individual applies
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.120 --> 03:37:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
vaccinated

03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:26.630 --> 03:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
thinking back to the situation i think
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
it was north or south dakota with the
 
03:37:30.790 --> 03:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
meat packing plants
 
03:37:30.800 --> 03:37:31.750 align:start position:0%
meat packing plants
and

03:37:31.750 --> 03:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
the individual says no
 
03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i said i can't take the risk for the
 
03:37:36.710 --> 03:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
rest of my
 
03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:38.070 align:start position:0%
rest of my
staff

03:37:38.070 --> 03:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
staff
 
03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
where might that play out
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
i i think that there's a difference
 
03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
between choosing not to hire somebody
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
and choosing to terminate somebody who's
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
currently under your employment so let
 
03:37:52.550 --> 03:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a clearer question perhaps
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
you're working in a meat processing
 
03:37:56.309 --> 03:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
plant one of your employees refuses the
 
03:37:58.950 --> 03:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
vaccination at this point in time the
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
covert vaccination is not an fda
 
03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
approved vaccination and i believe that
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
problematic if you terminated them for
 
03:38:12.550 --> 03:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
refusing to take a vaccination that is
 
03:38:14.630 --> 03:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh currently only authorized under an
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
emergency use authorization now uh until
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
that entirely plays out under the
 
03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:21.269 align:start position:0%
that entirely plays out under the
economic

03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
economic
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
the equal opportunity employment
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
commission i don't think we have that
 
03:38:28.389 --> 03:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
benefit of the prior rulings but
 
03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
by making reference to that statute
 
03:38:32.950 --> 03:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
we're basically trying to follow the
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes um and this is an exec
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
session so it does not have to be a
 
03:38:43.439 --> 03:38:45.429 align:start position:0%
session so it does not have to be a
question

03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:38:49.670 --> 03:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
you alluded to not fda approved
 
03:38:52.710 --> 03:38:52.720 align:start position:0%
however the eua is a form of fda
 
03:38:54.469 --> 03:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
approval it follows
 
03:38:56.550 --> 03:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
for the fda to provide
 
03:39:02.229 --> 03:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
this kind of approval so in a certain
 
03:39:02.239 --> 03:39:03.910 align:start position:0%
this kind of approval so in a certain
sense

03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
sense
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
they have four two forms of approval
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
one is the full formal approval which
 
03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
meets certain criteria the second is
 
03:39:15.670 --> 03:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
approval uh for the eua so in a sense
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh it would follow under at least my
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is
 
03:39:21.510 --> 03:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
and again that's what lawyers are for i
 
03:39:25.429 --> 03:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
guess uh the fda um
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
is still approving it even though it's
 
03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
eua it's under a different protocol
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding as well
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that i thought it
 
03:39:36.950 --> 03:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
would be good to have state law parallel
 
03:39:39.510 --> 03:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
federal law in this instance and i agree
 
03:39:41.429 --> 03:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
that the lawyers are continuing to argue
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
about it and whatever we decide they're
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
probably going to continue to do so
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
but this way we are making a standard
 
03:39:50.309 --> 03:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
that is neither stricter nor less strict
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:00.720 --> 03:40:01.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
i

03:40:01.990 --> 03:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:40:05.110 --> 03:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
agree that this makes the
 
03:40:08.469 --> 03:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh legislation considerably better so i
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
will certainly vote for the amendment
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
all of my concerns about the original
 
03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
legislation still remain and i
 
03:40:20.469 --> 03:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
i i think it um somewhat ironic that i
 
03:40:21.830 --> 03:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
am sitting here
 
03:40:24.550 --> 03:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
arguing the free market in that i think
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
that employers ought to be able to set
 
03:40:27.040 --> 03:40:27.830 align:start position:0%
that employers ought to be able to set
their

03:40:27.830 --> 03:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:40:30.710 --> 03:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
requirements and then people ought to be
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
able to decide whether they want to meet
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
them and be employed by that employer or
 
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
not meet them and be employed somewhere
 
03:40:37.760 --> 03:40:38.710 align:start position:0%
not meet them and be employed somewhere
else

03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
else
 
03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:39.830 align:start position:0%
else
um

03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:40.710 align:start position:0%
um
but

03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
life is full of ironies
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
i'm really concerned about the situation
 
03:40:49.750 --> 03:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
in which i
 
03:40:51.910 --> 03:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
will undoubtedly find myself at some
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
point in my life i live alone i might
 
03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
need personal care
 
03:40:58.150 --> 03:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
personal services whether it be
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
housekeeping or actual
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
physical care
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
and if i am presented by two different
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
people who
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
might seek my
 
03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:10.309 align:start position:0%
might seek my
job

03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
job
 
03:41:13.190 --> 03:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
i'm for darn sure going to employ the
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
one who has chosen to be vaccinated
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
rather than one who has chosen not to be
 
03:41:17.359 --> 03:41:19.030 align:start position:0%
rather than one who has chosen not to be
vaccinated

03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
as a matter of my personal safety and my
 
03:41:24.070 --> 03:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
personal choices and i don't want
 
03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
anybody to get vaccinated that doesn't
 
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
want to be i get it that they have their
 
03:41:31.269 --> 03:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
personal choice but i think that this
 
03:41:34.950 --> 03:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill skews the personal choice far too
 
03:41:34.960 --> 03:41:37.190 align:start position:0%
bill skews the personal choice far too
far

03:41:37.190 --> 03:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
far
 
03:41:39.830 --> 03:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
in in the opposite direction and i think
 
03:41:39.840 --> 03:41:40.950 align:start position:0%
in in the opposite direction and i think
that

03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
people have their own personal choices
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
and they
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
as mr
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
boy this committee is bringing my old
 
03:41:52.630 --> 03:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
teachers to my mind but as mr schwartz
 
03:41:54.630 --> 03:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
used to say you gotta make choices and
 
03:41:56.710 --> 03:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
then you gotta live with them
 
03:41:56.720 --> 03:41:58.469 align:start position:0%
then you gotta live with them
um

03:41:58.469 --> 03:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:02.229 --> 03:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
and and i really think that that's
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's true and so i think the bill goes
 
03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
too far i i think the amendment makes it
 
03:42:08.710 --> 03:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
better but i don't think the amendment
 
03:42:12.790 --> 03:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:12.800 --> 03:42:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you my read of
 
03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
the cfr
 
03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
might resolve the concern for
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
representative weber because it does
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
talk about the employer
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh who has
 
03:42:28.309 --> 03:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
this it affects people who have 15 or
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
more employees so it does sound like a
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
person who is small might be able to set
 
03:42:33.910 --> 03:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
a rule
 
03:42:35.830 --> 03:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
but more importantly as we look at the
 
03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
direct threat this is what makes me feel
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
a little more comfortable
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative woods it's
 
03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
vague but the sentence says significant
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
risk of substantial harm to the health
 
03:42:46.469 --> 03:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
or safety of the individual or others
 
03:42:48.229 --> 03:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
that cannot be eliminated or reduced by
 
03:42:50.870 --> 03:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation so
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
because the one i worry about the most
 
03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
is a healthcare facility being able to
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
ask that somebody who wishes to have
 
03:42:58.950 --> 03:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
direct patient contact
 
03:42:58.960 --> 03:42:59.670 align:start position:0%
direct patient contact
be

03:42:59.670 --> 03:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for let's say covet or for
 
03:43:02.080 --> 03:43:03.030 align:start position:0%
vaccinated for let's say covet or for
flu

03:43:03.030 --> 03:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
flu
 
03:43:05.990 --> 03:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
and it would seem like um
 
03:43:07.670 --> 03:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
that there's not really a good
 
03:43:09.429 --> 03:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation sure are things
 
03:43:12.150 --> 03:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
we can try to do for source spread for a
 
03:43:14.309 --> 03:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
person who's working with somebody else
 
03:43:16.630 --> 03:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
but they certainly still will present a
 
03:43:19.750 --> 03:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
threat to their patient if they are not
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and indeed get either covert
 
03:43:23.910 --> 03:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
or flu either one and these are people
 
03:43:25.590 --> 03:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
who are going to be a very unique risk
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
because they are not in the hospital
 
03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
because they're healthy usually
 
03:43:29.439 --> 03:43:30.229 align:start position:0%
because they're healthy usually
and

03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
as a result reading this
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
at least the language as i see it um
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
this still would allow an employer to be
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:43:41.349 --> 03:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
fire or not hire somebody because they
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
say look we can't reasonably accommodate
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
you as a nurse in this intensive care
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
unit uh
 
03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
if you are not vaccinated for
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
pick your disease covet or flu some type
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
of true transmissible um
 
03:43:57.670 --> 03:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm not at first i wasn't happy
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
with this but i think the reading of
 
03:44:01.750 --> 03:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is so squishy
 
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
and i guess i'd really love to have
 
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative weber's thought because
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
she is the token attorney on the
 
03:44:10.389 --> 03:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
committee as to whether or not that does
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
mean that it would still allow
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
an employer
 
03:44:13.439 --> 03:44:14.150 align:start position:0%
an employer
to

03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:44:15.510 --> 03:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
fire a person who refused to get
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated if they were in a position of
 
03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
directly potentially harming a patient
 
03:44:20.640 --> 03:44:21.750 align:start position:0%
directly potentially harming a patient
um

03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:22.710 --> 03:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
and i
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
remember yeah so i was wondering uh okay
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
headphones are back on representative
 
03:44:27.830 --> 03:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
mark if you alluded to the fact that it
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't occurred
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
do you say that then that
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
healthcare facilities have not been able
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
to tell somebody that they have to have
 
03:44:38.630 --> 03:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
a flu shot to work in there
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that the equal
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
employment opportunity commission held
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
that in the time of h1n1 that people who
 
03:44:49.189 --> 03:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
were fired because they refused the
 
03:44:52.150 --> 03:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine at that time were uh
 
03:44:55.590 --> 03:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
entitled to benefits so i believe that
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
at that point in time that's what they
 
03:44:58.630 --> 03:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
determined and i believe that more
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
recent rulings may be different and this
 
03:45:03.910 --> 03:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
is subject to some change
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
and and i don't have a problem with that
 
03:45:06.870 --> 03:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
because i think that as we understand
 
03:45:12.630 --> 03:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:37.670 --> 03:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
ken you're muted
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%

i said that
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%

is the amendment that we're talking
 
03:46:49.030 --> 03:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
about the correct number o three three
 
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
four h is that the one that we're
 
03:46:53.150 --> 03:46:53.160 align:start position:0%

representative nelson
 
03:47:02.830 --> 03:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
chairman i miss part of this
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
conversation but i think the question i
 
03:47:09.269 --> 03:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
have let's use the school system in
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
chicago for example the union does not
 
03:47:14.550 --> 03:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
want them to go back
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
what would happen if the nursing home
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
union or something pushes this
 
03:47:20.950 --> 03:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're not going to come back unless
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
you would they have the rights over
 
03:47:26.469 --> 03:47:26.479 align:start position:0%
the people who the facility
 
03:47:28.469 --> 03:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
or the teachers union have more rights
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:49.590 --> 03:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:53.670 --> 03:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:47:57.349 --> 03:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
i do support
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment to house bills due to
 
03:48:01.990 --> 03:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
i believe it
 
03:48:03.990 --> 03:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve all the issues but it does
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
address many of the concerns i had
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
when i look at the federal statute
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
specifically 29
 
03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:13.429 align:start position:0%
specifically 29
cfr

03:48:13.429 --> 03:48:13.439 align:start position:0%

03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:18.870 --> 03:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
it does talk about the issue of a direct
 
03:48:18.880 --> 03:48:19.990 align:start position:0%
it does talk about the issue of a direct
threat

03:48:19.990 --> 03:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
threat
 
03:48:22.150 --> 03:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
so it is defined to a certain degree
 
03:48:24.389 --> 03:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
within the statute the federal statute
 
03:48:26.469 --> 03:48:26.479 align:start position:0%
about what a direct threat is
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
answer i think the question that
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
representative nelson raised
 
03:48:31.439 --> 03:48:32.309 align:start position:0%
representative nelson raised
if

03:48:32.309 --> 03:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between having
 
03:48:36.950 --> 03:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
my opinion a threat to an organization
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
versus an organization wanting to have a
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
standard for employment so if the
 
03:48:43.030 --> 03:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
standard for employment was to have a
 
03:48:45.910 --> 03:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination as part of that versus a
 
03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
threat to the organization i think it's
 
03:48:49.189 --> 03:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
a different
 
03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
take on it this doesn't deal with the
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
standards it deals with threat to the
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
organization and also the employees
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
within the organization so it kind of
 
03:48:57.750 --> 03:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
looks at the individual rights versus
 
03:49:00.070 --> 03:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
the rights of all the other employees
 
03:49:01.990 --> 03:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
within the organization i think
 
03:49:03.750 --> 03:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
basically if the employer
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
determines that the threat everyone else
 
03:49:07.750 --> 03:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the organization outweighs the
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
individual rights that's when this would
 
03:49:13.030 --> 03:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:16.630 --> 03:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um

03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
um this amendment and um
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
as a school board member i recognize
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%

in on school children
 
03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
but as a city employer of the teachers
 
03:49:46.950 --> 03:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
we have had situations where we've
 
03:49:51.349 --> 03:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
already had teachers come down with
 
03:49:53.910 --> 03:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
with covet and they've been asked to go
 
03:49:53.920 --> 03:49:55.510 align:start position:0%
with covet and they've been asked to go
quarantine

03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
quarantine
 
03:49:58.630 --> 03:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
instead of staying in school to teach
 
03:50:00.870 --> 03:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
a memo of understanding with the
 
03:50:04.229 --> 03:50:04.239 align:start position:0%
teachers union
 
03:50:06.710 --> 03:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
that they won't come back to school
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
fully until we meet certain white
 
03:50:09.439 --> 03:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
fully until we meet certain white
criteria

03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
03:50:11.040 --> 03:50:11.990 align:start position:0%
criteria
um

03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm struggling with this bill and
 
03:50:16.870 --> 03:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
how we as a school board can get our
 
03:50:19.189 --> 03:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
children back children and their
 
03:50:21.510 --> 03:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
teachers back to school safely
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh interested in that discussing 29 cfr
 
03:50:34.399 --> 03:50:36.950 align:start position:0%
uh interested in that discussing 29 cfr
1630.2

03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
1630.2
 
03:50:40.870 --> 03:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
and using the examples of being
 
03:50:42.710 --> 03:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
not vaccinated
 
03:50:44.229 --> 03:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
should you you know what are their
 
03:50:44.239 --> 03:50:48.790 align:start position:0%
should you you know what are their
rights

03:50:48.790 --> 03:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:50.150 --> 03:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
other people
 
03:50:52.229 --> 03:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
like people in the hospital
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
or kids
 
03:50:56.710 --> 03:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
in this case the i'd say the elephant in
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
the room but to be fair is an elephant a
 
03:51:01.110 --> 03:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
donkey in the room
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
the real concern here is we're talking
 
03:51:05.910 --> 03:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
about covet because that's our direct
 
03:51:07.990 --> 03:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
concern right now
 
03:51:09.110 --> 03:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
as my
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that cova does not
 
03:51:13.990 --> 03:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
fit the bill here you can have the
 
03:51:16.070 --> 03:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine it protects you from getting
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
sick but you can still transmit
 
03:51:23.189 --> 03:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
that really changes the story about
 
03:51:28.150 --> 03:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative merchant hey i was just
 
03:51:32.710 --> 03:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
talking to him said it's a scam
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
i got this bill
 
03:51:37.189 --> 03:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
paul who was not muted would you please
 
03:51:37.199 --> 03:51:38.469 align:start position:0%
paul who was not muted would you please
mute

03:51:38.469 --> 03:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
mute
 
03:51:40.870 --> 03:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
the representative um
 
03:51:42.389 --> 03:51:42.399 align:start position:0%
i think i called on representative
 
03:51:51.269 --> 03:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i i i still
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
i have looked at the direct threat
 
03:51:57.439 --> 03:51:58.710 align:start position:0%
i have looked at the direct threat
language

03:51:58.710 --> 03:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:52:01.590 --> 03:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i agree that i i will i will take it
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
on faith that it applies only when there
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
are 15 or more um employees because
 
03:52:07.990 --> 03:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's somewhere else in the statute and
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
i haven't had a chance to up and down on
 
03:52:11.429 --> 03:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
that but
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
i i still don't think that this strikes
 
03:52:15.670 --> 03:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
the right balance for me i mean i think
 
03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
that the amendment is better but my
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
concern is that normal
 
03:52:23.030 --> 03:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:52:27.189 --> 03:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh an employer and they set out what are
 
03:52:27.199 --> 03:52:28.070 align:start position:0%
uh an employer and they set out what are
the

03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:30.630 --> 03:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh core functions of a job and i'm sort
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
of thinking for purposes of ada and
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
other things but you know there are jobs
 
03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
where you need to be there at 8 30 in
 
03:52:38.150 --> 03:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
the morning because you're the
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
receptionist and you need to be
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
there both to let people in the door and
 
03:52:44.469 --> 03:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
to answer the telephone and then there
 
03:52:46.150 --> 03:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
are other jobs where it doesn't matter
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
whether you come in at eight o'clock or
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
whether you come in at 10 o'clock as
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
long as your work gets done
 
03:52:56.790 --> 03:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
but i i really think that what this does
 
03:52:56.800 --> 03:52:57.670 align:start position:0%
but i i really think that what this does
is

03:52:57.670 --> 03:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:52:57.680 --> 03:52:59.189 align:start position:0%
is
it

03:52:59.189 --> 03:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:52:59.199 --> 03:53:00.389 align:start position:0%
it
shifts

03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
shifts
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
the analysis
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
so far
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
in favor of
 
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
the person who is refusing to get
 
03:53:08.800 --> 03:53:10.389 align:start position:0%
the person who is refusing to get
vaccinated

03:53:10.389 --> 03:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
that it takes away
 
03:53:15.189 --> 03:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of the autonomy of
 
03:53:17.269 --> 03:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
employers over
 
03:53:21.750 --> 03:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
how they want to set up their work says
 
03:53:24.309 --> 03:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
space and how they
 
03:53:28.950 --> 03:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh intend to make a safe space not only
 
03:53:31.269 --> 03:53:31.279 align:start position:0%
for the unvaccinated person but all the
 
03:53:32.950 --> 03:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
other employees
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
and then all the people that all the
 
03:53:37.110 --> 03:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
other employees go
 
03:53:39.830 --> 03:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
and breathe on or whatever it is that
 
03:53:41.990 --> 03:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about at the time
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
um and i think that
 
03:53:48.710 --> 03:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill even with the
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions this statement
 
03:53:51.680 --> 03:53:52.790 align:start position:0%
exceptions this statement
is

03:53:52.790 --> 03:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:53:52.800 --> 03:53:55.830 align:start position:0%
is
um

03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
so broad initially
 
03:53:58.800 --> 03:54:00.790 align:start position:0%
so broad initially
um

03:54:00.790 --> 03:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
and now i have i'm i'm sorry i have the
 
03:54:07.030 --> 03:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
cfr on my other device rather than the
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
actual bill but i think the statement in
 
03:54:11.189 --> 03:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
the original bill is so broad even with
 
03:54:13.990 --> 03:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
the exceptions that we are going to find
 
03:54:16.630 --> 03:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
it covers situations that are are going
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
to make us very uncomfortable
 
03:54:20.070 --> 03:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative cushman
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:54:27.840 --> 03:54:28.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:28.640 --> 03:54:29.429 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:54:29.429 --> 03:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:54:31.510 --> 03:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
the discussion that we're having is
 
03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:32.950 align:start position:0%
the discussion that we're having is
that

03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
you know the cfr um
 
03:54:36.870 --> 03:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
reference and this
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment is
 
03:54:38.960 --> 03:54:40.389 align:start position:0%
this amendment is
um

03:54:40.389 --> 03:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:42.309 --> 03:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing from
 
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
my friends across the aisle is that it's
 
03:54:44.160 --> 03:54:47.189 align:start position:0%
my friends across the aisle is that it's
not

03:54:47.189 --> 03:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:49.510 --> 03:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't leave enough freedom to the
 
03:54:51.670 --> 03:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
employers but i would argue that it
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
really isn't changing anything that
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
happens in our state if people
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
if someone gets fired
 
03:54:59.279 --> 03:55:00.630 align:start position:0%
if someone gets fired
currently

03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
for refusing to receive a vaccine from
 
03:55:03.840 --> 03:55:04.710 align:start position:0%
for refusing to receive a vaccine from
uh

03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:55:09.670 --> 03:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
in contrast to an employer's policy
 
03:55:10.870 --> 03:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
their their
 
03:55:13.110 --> 03:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
ability to address that
 
03:55:15.830 --> 03:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know and seek redress for that is by
 
03:55:18.150 --> 03:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
going through the eeoc and filing a
 
03:55:18.160 --> 03:55:19.110 align:start position:0%
going through the eeoc and filing a
complaint

03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:20.389 align:start position:0%
complaint
and

03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
um hoping that they
 
03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
receive a ruling on in their favor
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that's this what's in this bill is
 
03:55:30.389 --> 03:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
not is not going to change that this
 
03:55:33.429 --> 03:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
bill is addressing government mandating
 
03:55:33.439 --> 03:55:35.830 align:start position:0%
bill is addressing government mandating
vaccination

03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of the bill
 
03:55:38.560 --> 03:55:39.590 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of the bill
and

03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:40.870 --> 03:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:55:43.990 --> 03:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
this referencing the cfr
 
03:55:45.670 --> 03:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
just keeps things the same way that they
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
are with with employers in respect to
 
03:55:48.000 --> 03:55:51.670 align:start position:0%
are with with employers in respect to
employees

03:55:51.670 --> 03:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative merchants
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:01.590 --> 03:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
what i'm looking for is
 
03:56:03.990 --> 03:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
03:56:06.309 --> 03:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
there's the employment
 
03:56:07.990 --> 03:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
once you're employed and there's also
 
03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:09.510 align:start position:0%
once you're employed and there's also
pre-employment

03:56:09.510 --> 03:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
pre-employment
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
so does the amendment as written apply
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
to both pre-employment as well as
 
03:56:14.880 --> 03:56:16.229 align:start position:0%
to both pre-employment as well as
post-employment

03:56:16.229 --> 03:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
post-employment
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
in other words can an employer
 
03:56:19.990 --> 03:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
have a mandate that you have to have a
 
03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:21.110 align:start position:0%
have a mandate that you have to have a
certain

03:56:21.110 --> 03:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
certain
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
whatever may be to be a condition about
 
03:56:23.279 --> 03:56:24.630 align:start position:0%
whatever may be to be a condition about
employment

03:56:24.630 --> 03:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
employment
 
03:56:25.910 --> 03:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
would they still
 
03:56:28.229 --> 03:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
be allowed to do that
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
which is different than a threat once
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
you are employed so i look at the threat
 
03:56:35.670 --> 03:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
as current employees
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
that all of a sudden something is going
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
to threaten the organization and
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
therefore the employer thinks for the
 
03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
benefit of the whole
 
03:56:43.750 --> 03:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
we need to do something
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
which is different than
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
prior employment but the employer
 
03:56:50.150 --> 03:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
decides the employee in order to be
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
hired has to have a certain
 
03:57:02.389 --> 03:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:02.399 --> 03:57:07.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:09.510 --> 03:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:57:09.520 --> 03:57:11.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

03:57:11.830 --> 03:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.990 --> 03:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
i guess looking at this amendment i i do
 
03:57:16.950 --> 03:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
believe that it addresses the
 
03:57:19.590 --> 03:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know potential concerns and
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
conflicts in the law
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i thank representative marsh for
 
03:57:26.469 --> 03:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
having uh for having put together the
 
03:57:26.479 --> 03:57:27.910 align:start position:0%
having uh for having put together the
amendment

03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:57:27.920 --> 03:57:28.870 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

03:57:28.870 --> 03:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:31.030 --> 03:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth i
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just a tad bit uncomfortable with
 
03:57:35.910 --> 03:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
the with the provision regarding direct
 
03:57:38.150 --> 03:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
threat because i think that the
 
03:57:41.189 --> 03:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
the the language there is
 
03:57:43.830 --> 03:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
a bit too ambiguous having said that i i
 
03:57:46.150 --> 03:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
will vote for the amendment because i
 
03:57:47.910 --> 03:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
i would like this bill to pass i think
 
03:57:49.750 --> 03:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's important i guess the
 
03:57:49.760 --> 03:57:51.429 align:start position:0%
it's important i guess the
um

03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know the the the point i would make
 
03:57:56.550 --> 03:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
is that the decision to be vaccinated or
 
03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
not vaccinated is not a trivial decision
 
03:58:02.070 --> 03:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
i think that they're among many people
 
03:58:02.080 --> 03:58:03.189 align:start position:0%
i think that they're among many people
who

03:58:03.189 --> 03:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:58:05.189 --> 03:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
want the vaccine and intend to get the
 
03:58:05.199 --> 03:58:06.309 align:start position:0%
want the vaccine and intend to get the
vaccine

03:58:06.309 --> 03:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
and here i'm talking about covid but it
 
03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
could be any vaccine
 
03:58:12.790 --> 03:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
i think the attitude is very much that
 
03:58:14.950 --> 03:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
it isn't that big a deal what's the
 
03:58:18.630 --> 03:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
problem why wouldn't you want to do this
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
i can speak personally that for me the
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
decision to not
 
03:58:26.870 --> 03:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
um get the coveted vaccine in particular
 
03:58:29.510 --> 03:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
is a it comes from a deep deeply held
 
03:58:31.510 --> 03:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
personal belief
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
there are people who have very serious
 
03:58:35.670 --> 03:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
concerns about the
 
03:58:38.229 --> 03:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
the safety and efficacy of of that
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
particular vaccine and other vaccines
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
as such
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
this bill intends to protect people's
 
03:58:50.309 --> 03:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
rights to bodily integrity
 
03:58:52.309 --> 03:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
their right to exercise their personally
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
held belief and puts the burden on
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
employers and others to
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrate um that there is a
 
03:59:03.269 --> 03:59:03.279 align:start position:0%
compelling need for uh to to require
 
03:59:03.279 --> 03:59:04.150 align:start position:0%
compelling need for uh to to require
uh

03:59:04.150 --> 03:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:05.590 --> 03:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
any particular medical treatment
 
03:59:07.510 --> 03:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
including immunization
 
03:59:11.030 --> 03:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
we do restrict employers um
 
03:59:13.429 --> 03:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
03:59:13.439 --> 03:59:15.110 align:start position:0%
ability to
um

03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:16.389 --> 03:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
to impose certain employment
 
03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
requirements or or standards
 
03:59:21.670 --> 03:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh that have nothing to do with the job
 
03:59:24.070 --> 03:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
um this is this is common
 
03:59:26.790 --> 03:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that's a good thing
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
um if it doesn't have if somebody's life
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
decisions don't have anything to do with
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
their ability to perform the job um i i
 
03:59:35.670 --> 03:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
think the employer does not you know
 
03:59:37.590 --> 03:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
should not be uh should not be dictating
 
03:59:37.600 --> 03:59:38.469 align:start position:0%
should not be uh should not be dictating
that

03:59:38.469 --> 03:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
um so so i guess that you know that
 
03:59:42.550 --> 03:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
really is what drives my
 
03:59:42.560 --> 03:59:44.229 align:start position:0%
really is what drives my
um

03:59:44.229 --> 03:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
my decision on this uh which is that we
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
we really need to protect people's uh
 
03:59:51.349 --> 03:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
people's right to make that decision for
 
03:59:51.359 --> 03:59:52.550 align:start position:0%
people's right to make that decision for
themselves

03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
barring as is outlined in this amendment
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
a compelling case on the on the part of
 
04:00:00.150 --> 04:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
an employer
 
04:00:03.269 --> 04:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
that it is necessary to uh to to deal
 
04:00:07.510 --> 04:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.670 --> 04:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:13.830 --> 04:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i
 
04:00:15.429 --> 04:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm
 
04:00:18.389 --> 04:00:18.399 align:start position:0%
anticipating and going back to the
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
um bill when i shouldn't but i think
 
04:00:21.359 --> 04:00:22.389 align:start position:0%
um bill when i shouldn't but i think
that

04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:23.910 --> 04:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
in in the context of the discussion of
 
04:00:29.189 --> 04:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
direct threat and all the rest of the
 
04:00:32.150 --> 04:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
exceptions here i think we all need to
 
04:00:34.550 --> 04:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
bear firmly in mind that the underlying
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
bill does not talk about
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh solely about immunizations it says
 
04:00:43.030 --> 04:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
including immunizations but
 
04:00:45.269 --> 04:00:45.279 align:start position:0%
it requires that you can't be
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
discriminated against on the basis of
 
04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
any unwanted medical interventions and i
 
04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
wonder if people who require masks to
 
04:00:55.830 --> 04:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
enter their stores
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
would be held not to be able to do that
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
because it's an unwanted
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
medical intervention for somebody who
 
04:01:06.870 --> 04:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
does not want to wear a mask they
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:11.349 --> 04:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
do store keepers hospitals and other
 
04:01:14.710 --> 04:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
places hospitals obviously you can say
 
04:01:17.030 --> 04:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
that there is a direct medical necessity
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
and i think it probably would satisfy
 
04:01:21.349 --> 04:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
the tests under the cfr that we're
 
04:01:23.189 --> 04:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
talking about but i think that there are
 
04:01:25.830 --> 04:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
other places where
 
04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
you know getting into that kind of
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
litigation every single time
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
somebody decides they want to require a
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
mask as opposed to a vaccination
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
is a very real potential under this
 
04:01:42.180 --> 04:01:42.190 align:start position:0%
under this bill so
 
04:01:42.190 --> 04:01:43.750 align:start position:0%
under this bill so
[Music]

you know impose new regulations on
 
04:02:03.990 --> 04:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
places of public accommodation it is
 
04:02:10.630 --> 04:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
just for the sake of those who are
 
04:02:14.790 --> 04:02:14.800 align:start position:0%

we're almost there
 
04:02:22.070 --> 04:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
but we're not on 605 at the moment we
 
04:02:24.309 --> 04:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
are doing an executive session on house
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%

representative

04:02:41.110 --> 04:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
representative weber you're muted
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
you you just muted yourself again
 
04:02:52.710 --> 04:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
commuted again
 
04:02:54.550 --> 04:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
all right sorry about that
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
um in in response to representative
 
04:02:58.710 --> 04:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
cushman's point
 
04:03:02.070 --> 04:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
if that is what we want to be doing we
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
need to say that because this says no
 
04:03:06.389 --> 04:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
person may discriminate
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
no one may discriminate it's not limited
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
to government so if we want to ensure
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
that it's only government intrusion that
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
we are preventing then we need another
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
amendment that says we are preventing
 
04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:26.389 --> 04:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
the blanket that we have here
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman may i raise my hand uh you
 
04:03:31.830 --> 04:03:31.840 align:start position:0%

04:03:34.469 --> 04:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
i'm about to ask you if you would like
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%

04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%

04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
four minutes or if you would like uh
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%

04:03:50.070 --> 04:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
amendment is satisfactorily i will point
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
out to people there's been a lot of talk
 
04:03:53.670 --> 04:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
about discrimination the word
 
04:03:55.510 --> 04:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination does not appear here
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
anywhere uh it's merely uh
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
saying that people can't be compelled to
 
04:04:04.229 --> 04:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
have medical interventions uh so uh i'm
 
04:04:06.150 --> 04:04:06.160 align:start position:0%

and representative pearson yes
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment passes 20 to zero with one

the amendment passes 20 to zero with one
absence

04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
absence
 
04:05:44.870 --> 04:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
now we um
 
04:05:47.750 --> 04:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
are looking at house bill 220 amended
 
04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment it becomes
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
almost the entire reveal the only part
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
it doesn't is on the
 
04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh effective date which is 60 days after
 
04:06:00.550 --> 04:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
passage everything else the amendment
 
04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
replaces the bill
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
i hope we don't have a long conversation
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
because we've talked about most of it
 
04:06:08.070 --> 04:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
but we do have a few things that could
 
04:06:13.349 --> 04:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:13.359 --> 04:06:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
my

04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
concern and of course in unmuting myself
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
i've gotten rid of my text to the bill
 
04:06:18.960 --> 04:06:22.469 align:start position:0%
i've gotten rid of my text to the bill
again

04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
the concern that i have is we have left
 
04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
section one it doesn't replace section
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
one of the bill
 
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
and the second section sentence despite
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
what representative marsh just told you
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
the second sentence of section one which
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
still exists is
 
04:06:41.429 --> 04:06:41.439 align:start position:0%
no person
 
04:06:44.630 --> 04:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
may be discriminated against
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
for refusal to accept an unwanted
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
medical intervention including
 
04:06:53.429 --> 04:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
immunization it is not limited to
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
who is or is not doing the
 
04:06:57.910 --> 04:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
discriminating and it applies to every
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
person so that's pretty darn broad and i
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
just want to be sure that everybody
 
04:07:05.429 --> 04:07:05.439 align:start position:0%
understands that's what they're voting
 
04:07:07.510 --> 04:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
for if they're voting for it and that
 
04:07:10.550 --> 04:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
that language is why i'm not voting for
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
it because it doesn't confine things to
 
04:07:13.830 --> 04:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
the govern
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
government intervention it means
 
04:07:16.080 --> 04:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
government intervention it means
everybody

04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
well representative uh weber i would
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
i would ask you please to look at the
 
04:07:25.349 --> 04:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
amendment i think the amendment says
 
04:07:28.309 --> 04:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
amend the bill by replacing section one
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
so section one
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
the old bill is gone and that language
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
therefore is gone isn't it
 
04:07:36.960 --> 04:07:39.189 align:start position:0%
therefore is gone isn't it
and

04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i've gotten confused in my
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
screens here but
 
04:07:42.960 --> 04:07:44.870 align:start position:0%
screens here but
um

04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:46.389 --> 04:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
i am going to have to eat humble pie and
 
04:07:51.600 --> 04:07:53.349 align:start position:0%
i am going to have to eat humble pie and
um

04:07:53.349 --> 04:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
say that i was reading the part of the
 
04:07:58.309 --> 04:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
amendments that said inserting after
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
section one the following new section so
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
i was reading line four as being uh the
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill so i am going to
 
04:08:09.830 --> 04:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
apologize for that and
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
just say that um
 
04:08:13.349 --> 04:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:08:15.990 --> 04:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
not knowing when things are coming up
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
i ought to have been more prepared
 
04:08:18.399 --> 04:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
i ought to have been more prepared
but

04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:08:20.950 --> 04:08:20.960 align:start position:0%

anybody else with a hand up on the bill
 
04:08:27.760 --> 04:08:30.830 align:start position:0%
anybody else with a hand up on the bill
representative

04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:35.030 --> 04:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
shapiro you mr chairman i am um
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
comforted by many of the
 
04:08:40.229 --> 04:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
many aspects of the amendment
 
04:08:40.239 --> 04:08:41.670 align:start position:0%
many aspects of the amendment
especially

04:08:41.670 --> 04:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
especially
 
04:08:41.680 --> 04:08:43.110 align:start position:0%
especially
um

04:08:43.110 --> 04:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:43.120 --> 04:08:44.389 align:start position:0%
um
regarding

04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinations in schools um which my
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
understanding is that will remain
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
exactly as it is with an exception
 
04:08:51.840 --> 04:08:54.469 align:start position:0%
exactly as it is with an exception
um

04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.479 --> 04:08:55.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:08:55.269 --> 04:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:58.469 --> 04:08:58.479 align:start position:0%
with the cooperation of a physician or a
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
medical practitioner so i am comforted
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
by many of the things um
 
04:09:04.950 --> 04:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:12.550 --> 04:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
a nursing home does not really have the
 
04:09:17.260 --> 04:09:17.270 align:start position:0%
ability to um
 
04:09:17.270 --> 04:09:18.870 align:start position:0%
ability to um
[Music]

04:09:18.870 --> 04:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
to mandate that all its employees
 
04:09:24.070 --> 04:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
get vaccinated
 
04:09:25.990 --> 04:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
and under this bill
 
04:09:26.000 --> 04:09:27.189 align:start position:0%
and under this bill
um

04:09:27.189 --> 04:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
that would that would still be the case
 
04:09:32.070 --> 04:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
so nothing practical would change if my
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is correctly
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
but i am still concerned that you know
 
04:09:38.469 --> 04:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of a there's more
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
than a little bit there's a tug of war
 
04:09:40.239 --> 04:09:41.510 align:start position:0%
than a little bit there's a tug of war
between

04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:09:45.110 --> 04:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
group versus the rights of the
 
04:09:46.720 --> 04:09:48.070 align:start position:0%
group versus the rights of the
individual

04:09:48.070 --> 04:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
individual
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i am concerned that this kind of
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
further enshrines the rights of the
 
04:09:57.030 --> 04:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
individual over the rights of the
 
04:09:57.040 --> 04:09:59.830 align:start position:0%
individual over the rights of the
um

04:09:59.830 --> 04:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
of the group and in in the case of a
 
04:10:03.590 --> 04:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
nursing home all the patients and other
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
employees who work there so
 
04:10:05.920 --> 04:10:07.110 align:start position:0%
employees who work there so
um

04:10:07.110 --> 04:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
i am going to vote against
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else i think i see representative
 
04:10:18.000 --> 04:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
anyone else i think i see representative
kanark

04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
kanark
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes just a follow-up to representative
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
shapiro we often hear that phrase that
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard for the last 12 months we're
 
04:10:28.150 --> 04:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
all in this together i think that's kind
 
04:10:29.670 --> 04:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
of what representative shapiro is
 
04:10:31.269 --> 04:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
driving at
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
yes we do have individual rights we also
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
do have the rights to the group as a
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
whole and we are all in this together
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
and we have to sometimes
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
change a few things about our behavior
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
for the respect of others
 
04:10:44.319 --> 04:10:45.110 align:start position:0%
for the respect of others
uh

04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
our fellow
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
our fellow citizens or in the case of
 
04:10:49.760 --> 04:10:50.790 align:start position:0%
our fellow citizens or in the case of
employment

04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:10:52.229 --> 04:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
our patients that we're looking after
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we have to make sure we don't make
 
04:10:54.870 --> 04:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
them sick
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
so i also think that the amendment makes
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
it markedly better but i still oppose
 
04:11:00.950 --> 04:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
the bill thank you
 
04:11:03.349 --> 04:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
04:11:05.030 --> 04:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for my fellow representatives
 
04:11:07.349 --> 04:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
and especially representative shapiro i
 
04:11:08.790 --> 04:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
we truly need to be concerned as to
 
04:11:12.309 --> 04:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
whether we are protecting patients in
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and hospitals particularly
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
considering the number of patients
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
who've died in nursing homes uh from
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
covet 19 in the current epidemic i i
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
think that the number of deaths that
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
have occurred in nursing homes in this
 
04:11:28.229 --> 04:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
current pandemic is more than sufficient
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh to
 
04:11:31.910 --> 04:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
make the case that failing to be
 
04:11:33.910 --> 04:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated in that specific instance
 
04:11:36.389 --> 04:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
would constitute a direct threat so i
 
04:11:38.150 --> 04:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
believe that the language as we now have
 
04:11:40.469 --> 04:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
before us would cover that eventuality
 
04:11:42.389 --> 04:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
and and allow nursing homes to protect
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
their residents and for that reason i
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
intend to support this this bill is
 
04:11:46.800 --> 04:11:48.710 align:start position:0%
intend to support this this bill is
amended

04:11:48.710 --> 04:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
amended
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:11:56.309 --> 04:11:56.319 align:start position:0%
i also concur with representativero that
 
04:11:58.710 --> 04:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
the fundamental issue that i see is the
 
04:12:01.269 --> 04:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
group versus the individual
 
04:12:02.950 --> 04:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment the way it's written does
 
04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
allow for the employer to make that
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
determination based upon an individual
 
04:12:06.880 --> 04:12:08.070 align:start position:0%
determination based upon an individual
situation

04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
that the benefits of the group outweigh
 
04:12:11.590 --> 04:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
the benefits of the individual
 
04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
so even though
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
we're leaving it open to uh
 
04:12:18.070 --> 04:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation i think it comes down to
 
04:12:20.150 --> 04:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
allowing the employer to make that
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
determination is to benefit the group
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
does outweigh in fact the benefit to the
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
individual and therefore they can still
 
04:12:29.429 --> 04:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
mandate under the federal law
 
04:12:29.439 --> 04:12:33.750 align:start position:0%
mandate under the federal law
requirement

04:12:33.750 --> 04:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
final chance before we vote
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
seeing representative cushman stand up
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee i urge you
 
04:12:43.920 --> 04:12:44.630 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee i urge you
to

04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
vote the support of this bill
 
04:12:46.640 --> 04:12:47.830 align:start position:0%
vote the support of this bill
um

04:12:47.830 --> 04:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're having this philosophical
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
difference here about uh individualism
 
04:12:53.910 --> 04:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
versus collectivism
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
and i just want to remind everybody that
 
04:12:58.070 --> 04:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is the united states of america and
 
04:13:00.389 --> 04:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
the individual rights are protected by
 
04:13:02.070 --> 04:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
04:13:02.080 --> 04:13:02.950 align:start position:0%
the constitution
and

04:13:02.950 --> 04:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
enshrined in nursing codes of ethics
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
also in provision one
 
04:13:11.110 --> 04:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
the the right of bodily autonomy
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
and self-determination is outlined as
 
04:13:13.439 --> 04:13:14.309 align:start position:0%
and self-determination is outlined as
being

04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:13:18.070 --> 04:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
imperative it is of utmost importance in
 
04:13:18.080 --> 04:13:19.189 align:start position:0%
imperative it is of utmost importance in
care

04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:13:21.030 --> 04:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
this is a principle that
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
is threaded throughout our society and
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
throughout our history and we need to
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
ensure that people have that right
 
04:13:30.229 --> 04:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:13:31.590 --> 04:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that it's the
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility of you know if someone
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
sees that
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
a risk with a vaccine they shouldn't
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
have to potentially set themselves on
 
04:13:43.110 --> 04:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
fire to keep others warm this is a way
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
i've heard it phrased before you know
 
04:13:45.279 --> 04:13:46.710 align:start position:0%
i've heard it phrased before you know
it's

04:13:46.710 --> 04:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
it this is an individual decision
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
people's health
 
04:13:53.269 --> 04:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's a balance of benefit versus risk
 
04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
to an intervention
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
and no one should be
 
04:13:58.149 --> 04:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:14:01.030 --> 04:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
on a second tier in society because they
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
make a decision about their health that
 
04:14:04.469 --> 04:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
other people don't agree with they're
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
individuals and they have a right to
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
make decisions over their bodies thank
 
04:14:08.080 --> 04:14:10.950 align:start position:0%
make decisions over their bodies thank
you

04:14:10.950 --> 04:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
i see representative i think i say
 
04:14:19.189 --> 04:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:21.510 --> 04:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
i will try to be extraordinarily brief
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm also going to vote against this bill
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
although i do like the
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
some attempts that the amendment has
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
made to correct it
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
i guess when we talk about bodily
 
04:14:32.229 --> 04:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
integrity that's one thing but
 
04:14:34.149 --> 04:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
when we talk about integrity from having
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
to wear masks or socially distance etc
 
04:14:38.550 --> 04:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
that i have the right to refuse to do
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
that even though i know full well that
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
it endangers people around me i do not
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
want to give any individual the right to
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
make that claim and put my health in the
 
04:14:50.149 --> 04:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
health of other people that i care about
 
04:14:51.990 --> 04:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
at risk so i'm going to vote against the
 
04:14:53.429 --> 04:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill although i will vote for the
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
amendment because i think
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
at least that's a qualified attempt to
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
improve what i consider to be a bad bill
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
to start with
 
04:15:05.110 --> 04:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm i'm a little
 
04:15:08.950 --> 04:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
confused i think we've already have we
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
not already voted the amendment we have
 
04:15:12.469 --> 04:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
heard the amendment we're not voting the
 
04:15:14.309 --> 04:15:14.319 align:start position:0%
bill and i
 
04:15:16.469 --> 04:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that
 
04:15:20.550 --> 04:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know having completely mis
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
missed a small piece uh but an important
 
04:15:25.830 --> 04:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
small piece of the amendment
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
and knowing that we're over time
 
04:15:31.189 --> 04:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
i would very much appreciate it if we
 
04:15:34.710 --> 04:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
could recess the executive session and
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
until the next time we meet on this bill
 
04:15:39.750 --> 04:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
because i have been arguing very
 
04:15:41.830 --> 04:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
fiercely against it
 
04:15:45.269 --> 04:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
on the basis of having the no person may
 
04:15:48.550 --> 04:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
discriminate language which has now been
 
04:15:48.560 --> 04:15:49.830 align:start position:0%
discriminate language which has now been
removed

04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
removed
 
04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
and i'd like a chance to just think
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
about it a little more
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
and i want to be sure also that i have
 
04:15:57.199 --> 04:15:58.149 align:start position:0%
and i want to be sure also that i have
not

04:15:58.149 --> 04:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:15:58.159 --> 04:15:58.950 align:start position:0%
not
been

04:15:58.950 --> 04:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:16:02.950 --> 04:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
to the extent that i can influence
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
anybody on this committee and and heaven
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
knows you're all very very strong people
 
04:16:10.630 --> 04:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh i want to be sure that i have not
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
been raising red flags for people which
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
have actually been addressed and i can't
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
really make that determination this
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
quickly and i'm sorry not to have
 
04:16:24.309 --> 04:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
gotten hold of the right end of the
 
04:16:27.269 --> 04:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
stick earlier but i wonder if we might
 
04:16:30.070 --> 04:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
just have a little more time on this one
 
04:16:32.309 --> 04:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
let me put this to representative marsh
 
04:16:36.389 --> 04:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor of the now amended bill
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
would you like us to come back to this
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative or are you ready to roll
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
well that's two separate questions
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
personally i'm ready to roll but i don't
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
think representative weber's ready to
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
roll and this committee usually works
 
04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
fairly cooperatively and she's made
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
accommodations for me in the past and
 
04:16:55.590 --> 04:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm okay this is the deadline for
 
04:16:58.309 --> 04:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
this is not tomorrow so i'm i'm willing
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
to let it go until the next time we
 
04:17:01.990 --> 04:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
exact bills if
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's your pleasure pervasive on many
 
04:17:04.080 --> 04:17:08.950 align:start position:0%
that's your pleasure pervasive on many
occasions

04:17:08.950 --> 04:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.110 --> 04:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
all right is that is that a hand surgeon
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrating his crafter does he wish
 
04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
to be recognized representative woods
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you i'm going to expose my
 
04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
um perhaps confusion
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
but i need uh clarification
 
04:17:30.720 --> 04:17:32.070 align:start position:0%
but i need uh clarification
um

04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:34.870 --> 04:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we addressed i
 
04:17:34.880 --> 04:17:35.830 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we addressed i
thought

04:17:35.830 --> 04:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
thought
 
04:17:37.590 --> 04:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
i understood
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
but could you clarify exactly the number
 
04:17:43.990 --> 04:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that we talked about
 
04:17:49.189 --> 04:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
0 3 3 4 h that's exactly what i thought
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
might i add
 
04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
and this was to a comment made by
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
04:17:57.590 --> 04:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
that section one still stands an
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
amendment states it says
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
by inserting after
 
04:18:05.349 --> 04:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
section one
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
so section one in the original bill
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
no if i may mr chair yes
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh no i i neglected to read line one i
 
04:18:20.630 --> 04:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
believe you're reading
 
04:18:20.640 --> 04:18:21.670 align:start position:0%
believe you're reading
line

04:18:21.670 --> 04:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
three and you just took the same wrong
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
turn that i took to begin with
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
line one says amend the bill by
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
replacing section one with the following
 
04:18:35.670 --> 04:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
so the language of the original bill
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
that has the
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
this is this is why i'd really like a
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
little more time basically to get this
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
sort of i see where you're i i just i
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
didn't read i didn't
 
04:18:48.149 --> 04:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
did not read line one
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to move on because one
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
good question leads to another and i'm
 
04:18:55.830 --> 04:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
going to take the suggestion that we
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
will look at this and continue the
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
executive session from where we left off
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
we don't revoke the amendment that's
 
04:19:05.349 --> 04:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
been voted in if representative marsh
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
wishes to do anything or anybody else
 
04:19:08.950 --> 04:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
wishes to bring an amendment they have
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
the right to do that we will not be
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
picking this up
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
until at least we meet again if not
 
04:19:14.560 --> 04:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
until at least we meet again if not
later

04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the chair calls on the clerk for
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
probably a
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
procedural question
 
04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
you guessed that one um in uh for past
 
04:19:24.720 --> 04:19:25.750 align:start position:0%
you guessed that one um in uh for past
clerks

04:19:25.750 --> 04:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
clerks
 
04:19:27.110 --> 04:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
do i
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
um begin an executive session report
 
04:19:34.070 --> 04:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
turn it in and then later do a
 
04:19:34.080 --> 04:19:35.429 align:start position:0%
turn it in and then later do a
supplement

04:19:35.429 --> 04:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
supplement
 
04:19:39.910 --> 04:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
since we did vote on the amendment today
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
i would defer to um
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
my predecessor for wisdom on that and i
 
04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
didn't even bring
 
04:19:48.870 --> 04:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
masons with me uh
 
04:19:51.670 --> 04:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
i mean i i can ask i can i can contact
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
paul smith
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
i would ask hcs frankly okay
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
my own thought would be hold it until we
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
have the entire executive session
 
04:20:02.080 --> 04:20:04.149 align:start position:0%
have the entire executive session
completed

04:20:04.149 --> 04:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
completed
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
they may want it done differently so
 
04:20:06.319 --> 04:20:07.189 align:start position:0%
they may want it done differently so
okay

04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:20:09.030 --> 04:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'll double check with them thank you
 
04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:20:12.070 --> 04:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
but i'd hold on to it until we got all
 
04:20:14.149 --> 04:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
the way done
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
executive session is in recess and now
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
the chair opens a
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
what it is a discussion a hearing that's
 
04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
it on um
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
house bill 605
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
and we start with an amendment
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:20:38.229 --> 04:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.239 --> 04:20:39.429 align:start position:0%
 
h

04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
h
 
04:20:43.670 --> 04:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment to 605.
 
04:20:43.680 --> 04:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
an amendment to 605.
um

04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:49.910 --> 04:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
i'm totally yeah we have to hear the
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
bill first
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
you need to have somebody introduce the
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
bill that is that is where my mind was
 
04:21:00.550 --> 04:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
limping towards
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
so right
 
04:21:01.920 --> 04:21:03.030 align:start position:0%
so right

605 f and representative conley your
bill

04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:20.550 --> 04:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
mr chairman committee members are you

uh well thank you uh for the opportunity
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
to come before you today i am
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
casey connolly state representative from
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
dover stratfor county district 13.
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i am here to introduce hb 605.
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill contains a number of
 
04:21:39.110 --> 04:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
enhancements to the new hampshire
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis statute some of
 
04:21:43.269 --> 04:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
which the house has heard before
 
04:21:45.110 --> 04:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
and some of which this committee has
 
04:21:48.790 --> 04:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
heard before in separate measures
 
04:21:51.429 --> 04:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
but i will highlight a few key aspects
 
04:21:54.070 --> 04:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
of this bill um
 
04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
now one is uh it would allow for home
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
cultivation of cannabis for people who
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
are designated caregivers that's
 
04:22:02.600 --> 04:22:02.610 align:start position:0%
something not allowed under statute
 
04:22:02.610 --> 04:22:03.830 align:start position:0%
something not allowed under statute
[Music]

04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:22:05.590 --> 04:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill sets guidelines and restrictions
 
04:22:07.429 --> 04:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
for how this would be done
 
04:22:07.439 --> 04:22:09.429 align:start position:0%
for how this would be done
um

04:22:09.429 --> 04:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
and it also provides an avenue for
 
04:22:13.510 --> 04:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
people who who use this medicine to to
 
04:22:15.349 --> 04:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
get it at a more affordable price we
 
04:22:16.630 --> 04:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
know cost
 
04:22:18.550 --> 04:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
is a recurring concern
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic cannabis patients
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
and this could presumably help with that
 
04:22:25.110 --> 04:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
um it also sort of brings new
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire's standards uh for therapy
 
04:22:28.950 --> 04:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis more in line with surrounding
 
04:22:28.960 --> 04:22:30.229 align:start position:0%
cannabis more in line with surrounding
states

04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:22:30.239 --> 04:22:31.110 align:start position:0%
states
um

04:22:31.110 --> 04:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:33.429 --> 04:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
it adds two new qualifying conditions
 
04:22:35.189 --> 04:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
one for moderate and severe insomnia the
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
other for opioid misuse disorder
 
04:22:38.479 --> 04:22:39.349 align:start position:0%
other for opioid misuse disorder
um

04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:41.269 --> 04:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
it will allow therapeutic cannabis
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
patients to be certified for up to three
 
04:22:46.149 --> 04:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
years instead of every year
 
04:22:48.550 --> 04:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
it would allow people from other states
 
04:22:51.030 --> 04:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
who are qualified and certified in the
 
04:22:52.790 --> 04:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
places they live for therapeutic
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis to access their medicine within
 
04:22:56.469 --> 04:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
therefore you know eliminating issues
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
around transporting the medicine across
 
04:23:03.990 --> 04:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
state lines and just ensures that they
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
can have access to it while they're
 
04:23:06.950 --> 04:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
visiting our state or working here or
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
whatever brings them here
 
04:23:09.990 --> 04:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
and finally there are just a number of
 
04:23:11.530 --> 04:23:11.540 align:start position:0%
other housekeeping
 
04:23:11.540 --> 04:23:12.710 align:start position:0%
other housekeeping
[Music]

04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
points uh included in this bill
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
so although i am the prime sponsor uh

rockingham district 21 and i'm here in
 
04:24:09.670 --> 04:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
when the legislature kind of went into
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
hibernation last year
 
04:24:15.349 --> 04:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
there were a number of pieces of
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that had passed both the
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
house and the senate that related to our
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
and uh what i did
 
04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:24:29.349 --> 04:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the early uh spring late spring and
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
early summer was to cobble bills that
 
04:24:34.870 --> 04:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
had been passed by the house
 
04:24:34.880 --> 04:24:35.910 align:start position:0%
had been passed by the house
um

04:24:35.910 --> 04:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
primarily through this committee and
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
bills that have been passed through the
 
04:24:42.790 --> 04:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
senate uh that related a therapeutic
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis and put them together and and i
 
04:24:46.950 --> 04:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
tried to bring them
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
forward to the senate in the hopes that
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
it might make the cut uh as
 
04:24:56.630 --> 04:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
a one of the um omnibus bills that the
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
senate uh put before us uh unfortunately
 
04:25:01.830 --> 04:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
i was told that there would be no
 
04:25:04.229 --> 04:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
bills that had the word cannabis in them
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
that would make it to the level of being
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
able to be an omnibus bill
 
04:25:11.670 --> 04:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
so what you have before you is uh
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
essentially that that would be
 
04:25:14.880 --> 04:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
essentially that that would be
uh

04:25:15.750 --> 04:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill uh that that we bring in
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
now and upset what the bill contains are
 
04:25:24.870 --> 04:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
includes senate bill 548 from last year
 
04:25:28.469 --> 04:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 703 from last year
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
those were both passed by the senate
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
unanimously on their way both of those
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
bills were requested by the department
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
of health and human service by the
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and it's
 
04:25:40.309 --> 04:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
incorporated and one of the simple
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
protections for uh you know employees of
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
health and human services for
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
transporting you know materials that
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be otherwise prescribed but doing
 
04:25:53.590 --> 04:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
so as part of their job for working with
 
04:25:56.309 --> 04:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program um and
 
04:25:58.389 --> 04:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
the other uh
 
04:26:01.429 --> 04:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
was a uh you know making some changes
 
04:26:03.189 --> 04:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
registry identification card again
 
04:26:07.990 --> 04:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
simple just simple uh the matters that
 
04:26:08.000 --> 04:26:08.790 align:start position:0%
simple just simple uh the matters that
the

04:26:08.790 --> 04:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:11.349 --> 04:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
the agency thought would be appropriate
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
and did um
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
so then it also included house bill 366
 
04:26:21.189 --> 04:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
which added opioid misuse and abuse to
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
the qualifying conditions
 
04:26:26.550 --> 04:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
and house bill 461
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
which added insomnia to qualifying
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
medical conditions
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
it also uh included house bill 1150
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
which permitted qualified patients
 
04:26:38.630 --> 04:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
visiting from the out of state to access
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire therapeutic cannabis
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
dependent dispensaries you know right
 
04:26:44.790 --> 04:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
now uh
 
04:26:47.590 --> 04:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
maine you know some states recognize uh
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
a reciprocity if someone has a is a
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient here in new
 
04:26:54.710 --> 04:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire they go to maine on vacation
 
04:26:56.950 --> 04:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
or go to school uh their their card
 
04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
there is recognized and they can use it
 
04:27:01.269 --> 04:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
in a dispensary uh right now new
 
04:27:03.429 --> 04:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire does not have a similar
 
04:27:06.149 --> 04:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
reciprocity uh system so that was a
 
04:27:09.750 --> 04:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward uh request um and
 
04:27:13.510 --> 04:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the last two are house bill 1356
 
04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
which repealed the therapeutic use of
 
04:27:16.750 --> 04:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis advisory board in house bill
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
1591 relative to cannabis use during
 
04:27:21.429 --> 04:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
pregnancy both of which as you know
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
passed the the house and i believe that
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
they are before you as um a
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
as new bill's separate bills this um
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
session um but anyhow that's what that's
 
04:27:35.830 --> 04:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
basically what's included in house bill
 
04:27:37.910 --> 04:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
605 i wanted to know where it came from
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted to um you know
 
04:27:44.309 --> 04:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:46.710 --> 04:27:46.720 align:start position:0%

04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
it appears that we have actually already
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
exact several provisions that may be
 
04:28:12.790 --> 04:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
either included or similar to provisions
 
04:28:14.469 --> 04:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
that are in
 
04:28:15.830 --> 04:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
would you be okay if somebody on the
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee took out
 
04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
knowing the senate's
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
dislike of omnibus bills not created by
 
04:28:25.279 --> 04:28:26.389 align:start position:0%
dislike of omnibus bills not created by
them

04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:28:26.399 --> 04:28:27.429 align:start position:0%
them
um

04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
would you be okay if if committee
 
04:28:32.309 --> 04:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
members took out the pieces that we've
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
acted on separately already and simply
 
04:28:36.870 --> 04:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
left the other bits
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:28:40.630 --> 04:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know of course
 
04:28:42.870 --> 04:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
i you know what like i'm gonna steal it
 
04:28:44.950 --> 04:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
again as i said i recognized
 
04:28:46.790 --> 04:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
that uh you know when this bill was
 
04:28:48.550 --> 04:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
written and submitted i had no idea
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
which individual component what other
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
bills would be out there that would
 
04:28:52.870 --> 04:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
relate to this i know that you've passed
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
legislation and if that makes sense go
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
ahead and do it please
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:01.670 --> 04:29:01.680 align:start position:0%

any other questions for the democratic
leader

04:29:07.349 --> 04:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
i think representative acton wants to
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
ask me a question
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%

you mr leader um
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe that it was probably
 
04:29:22.870 --> 04:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
me who should have communicated with you
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
and cleaned this up before it got to
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
this point but it happened at a time i
 
04:29:28.229 --> 04:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
was extremely busy and it slipped
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
through the cracks like earlier this
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%

so however it is that the that you and
 
04:29:55.910 --> 04:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
your committee feel uh would be best to
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
proceed i'm supportive of that
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and i will be available for uh
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.830 --> 04:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you uh
 
04:30:11.349 --> 04:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
representative cushing um
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
my question is having to do the first
 
04:30:13.680 --> 04:30:14.950 align:start position:0%
my question is having to do the first
portion

04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
portion
 
04:30:17.110 --> 04:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
where it protects employees of the
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
funds possessing the transporting
 
04:30:21.199 --> 04:30:22.389 align:start position:0%
funds possessing the transporting
um

04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:26.710 --> 04:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
do they have protections for if they're
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
in possession for transporting any other
 
04:30:32.710 --> 04:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh um
 
04:30:35.269 --> 04:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
medications that would
 
04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise be illegal to transport
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
without a prescription
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
i believe that this was said you know
 
04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
this would recognize that there are
 
04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
exemptions for we do we make exemptions
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
under under the therapeutic cannabis law
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
for uh use for possession
 
04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
of uh substances that otherwise are
 
04:31:01.510 --> 04:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited and this would be ensure that
 
04:31:01.520 --> 04:31:02.550 align:start position:0%
prohibited and this would be ensure that
um

04:31:02.550 --> 04:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
that an employee of dhhs who in the
 
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
process of you know transporting this
 
04:31:09.429 --> 04:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't isn't held liable for it i think
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
it's kind of i can't anticipate anyone
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
actually being prosecuted for doing
 
04:31:18.630 --> 04:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:25.670 --> 04:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
my hand is not raised
 
04:31:25.680 --> 04:31:27.590 align:start position:0%
my hand is not raised
sorry

04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
my hand is not up but thank you for
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
recognizing me
 
04:31:33.510 --> 04:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i can recognize you all from about 30
 
04:31:34.950 --> 04:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
feet now
 
04:31:39.670 --> 04:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
then uh thank you mr leader and we all
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
stand with you at this time sir
 
04:31:51.189 --> 04:31:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:53.510 --> 04:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes uh representative
 
04:31:53.520 --> 04:31:56.710 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes uh representative
kenner

04:31:56.710 --> 04:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um and again for the
 
04:32:00.469 --> 04:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
record representative jerry kirk
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
representing carroll county dis uh
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
district three and uh
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
i'm here again today in my capacity as
 
04:32:08.229 --> 04:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
the chair of the therapeutic cannabis
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board
 
04:32:12.870 --> 04:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
um i sent everybody written testimony a
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
lot of it is redundant with what we said
 
04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
before but i wanted it in the record for
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
this particular bill um so i will be
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
kind of glossing over things because
 
04:32:23.110 --> 04:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
again this is a bill that certainly has
 
04:32:25.110 --> 04:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of different parts to it and the
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
part that i'm going to primarily
 
04:32:28.389 --> 04:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
concentrate on then is the part about
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at hb 605 page 1 lines 22 to
 
04:32:35.510 --> 04:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
that adds opioid use disorder as a
 
04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition
 
04:32:40.149 --> 04:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
yet as organisms stated this language
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
stems from a 2019 retained bill hb 366
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
which sought to add opius opioid use
 
04:32:49.830 --> 04:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
disorder oud as a qualifying condition
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
tcmob did consider this condition in
 
04:32:53.830 --> 04:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
detail with a preliminary discussion
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
hearing and really a couple of different
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
meetings where we had rather robust uh
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
heated discussions about it and the
 
04:33:01.269 --> 04:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
point is that the question of using
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and oud is
 
04:33:03.279 --> 04:33:05.029 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and oud is
complicated

04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
04:33:06.470 --> 04:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
first it's important to understand and
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
this is really critical the cannabis
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
does have benefit in treating chronic
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
pain either replacing an opioid or
 
04:33:15.510 --> 04:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
decreasing the required dose of an
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
opioid for a patient to have sufficient
 
04:33:17.279 --> 04:33:18.390 align:start position:0%
opioid for a patient to have sufficient
relief

04:33:18.390 --> 04:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
relief
 
04:33:20.629 --> 04:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
but that fact does not prove that
 
04:33:24.070 --> 04:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis can successfully treat oud
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
because oud is different than chronic
 
04:33:28.230 --> 04:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
pain it is an addiction with craving and
 
04:33:31.029 --> 04:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
life disruption so very different so we
 
04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
can't make an automatic assumption
 
04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
pointless cannabis has a lot of uh
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
bioactive cannabinoids and terpenes that
 
04:33:40.150 --> 04:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
all have different physiologic effects
 
04:33:40.160 --> 04:33:41.590 align:start position:0%
all have different physiologic effects
thc

04:33:41.590 --> 04:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
thc
 
04:33:43.189 --> 04:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
the psychoactive component that causes
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
euphoria and this is the tricky part it
 
04:33:47.670 --> 04:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
stimulates the reward system and
 
04:33:49.349 --> 04:33:49.359 align:start position:0%
therefore it does have addictive
 
04:33:49.359 --> 04:33:50.551 align:start position:0%
therefore it does have addictive
properties

04:33:50.551 --> 04:33:50.561 align:start position:0%
properties
 
04:33:52.150 --> 04:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
which is what can lead to cannabis use
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
disorder directly and the increased rate
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
of oud in people who have chronic
 
04:33:57.990 --> 04:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis use and that may be
 
04:34:00.310 --> 04:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
counterproductive in treating oud now
 
04:34:02.551 --> 04:34:02.561 align:start position:0%
cbd can be very helpful in reducing
 
04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
anxiety and craving in the early
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
abstinence from opioids
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
so it may have a role in treating oud by
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
reducing the risk of relapse so in 2019
 
04:34:15.109 --> 04:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
we worked really hard to try to develop
 
04:34:17.109 --> 04:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
some compromised language to
 
04:34:19.590 --> 04:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
allow oud as a qualifying condition but
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
again with some rather strict parameters
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
the parameters being that we certified
 
04:34:26.510 --> 04:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
only by a clinician waivered to provide
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
medication-assisted treatment for oud
 
04:34:31.830 --> 04:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
or a certified addiction medicine or
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
addition addiction psychiatry physician
 
04:34:36.629 --> 04:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
and would be used to treat the cravings
 
04:34:38.310 --> 04:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
or the withdrawal
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
and we it's important to understand that
 
04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
the certifying provider does have the
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
authority to require that the atc would
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
provide a cbd dominant therapeutic
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis if that's what they desired
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately the boat the board voted to
 
04:34:56.470 --> 04:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
not approve oud as a qualifying
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
condition but the decision was quite
 
04:35:01.590 --> 04:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
split it was four to six
 
04:35:02.869 --> 04:35:02.879 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:35:04.470 --> 04:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
we brought i brought that recommendation
 
04:35:07.590 --> 04:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
back to hhsea and the um
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
fall of 19 and then it came through to
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
us uh to vote on later in the early part
 
04:35:16.470 --> 04:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
of 2020. um and the
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
committee hhsea did vote to still
 
04:35:20.949 --> 04:35:20.959 align:start position:0%
approve oud they felt that
 
04:35:23.109 --> 04:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
you know they got kind of mixed guidance
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
from tcmob
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
and felt it was reasonable enough to
 
04:35:28.709 --> 04:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
still put it in again it passed the
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
house but died in the table in the
 
04:35:30.561 --> 04:35:31.429 align:start position:0%
house but died in the table in the
senate

04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
senate
 
04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
now i brought it back to the to the
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
board we decided not to formally revote
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
on it but we did actually even work on
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
the language a little bit further
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
implying that you know again we
 
04:35:42.869 --> 04:35:42.879 align:start position:0%
understand that this isn't a cut and
 
04:35:44.949 --> 04:35:44.959 align:start position:0%
dried uh decision
 
04:35:46.949 --> 04:35:46.959 align:start position:0%
so we clarified one other thing which
 
04:35:48.949 --> 04:35:48.959 align:start position:0%
will need to be added to this if we go
 
04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
forward with this we wanted to clarify
 
04:35:53.590 --> 04:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
that that waivered physician has to be
 
04:35:56.789 --> 04:35:56.799 align:start position:0%
the physician that's providing the mat
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
for that individual patient not just any
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
random person that does mat but the
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
person who cares for the patient who's
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
being certified
 
04:36:07.349 --> 04:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
and in my written testimony i do have
 
04:36:09.670 --> 04:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
that language and the that phrase that
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be added for the individual
 
04:36:11.279 --> 04:36:12.949 align:start position:0%
needs to be added for the individual
patient

04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
the section on insomnia we've already
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
talked about that that's in
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
hb 89 we've already passed that this
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
morning i won't go any further on that
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
um the autism spectrum disorder i was
 
04:36:25.670 --> 04:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to bring forward again the request
 
04:36:27.590 --> 04:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
to add that as an amendment here if
 
04:36:29.670 --> 04:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
desired but again we've already added
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
that to
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%
sb-80 sorry hb 89 so it's probably not
 
04:36:38.070 --> 04:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to consider that for this bill
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
depending on whether strategy wise we
 
04:36:42.390 --> 04:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
think it's better to have an
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill or not but given what we've
 
04:36:46.150 --> 04:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
just said the other side of the wall
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't always like an omnibus bill they
 
04:36:49.750 --> 04:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
didn't write so it's probably better to
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
let that be freestanding the pregnancy
 
04:36:53.990 --> 04:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
and cannabis use i would say again hb
 
04:36:55.910 --> 04:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
163 which we're voting on in a couple of
 
04:36:55.920 --> 04:36:56.789 align:start position:0%
163 which we're voting on in a couple of
days

04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
days
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
does an even better job than in this
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
bill it's more robust and includes that
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
education about cannabis use and
 
04:37:04.390 --> 04:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
adolescence so that could certainly be
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
amended out so the bottom line is large
 
04:37:10.709 --> 04:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
portions of this bill can be amended out
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
and the oud though is still i think
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
controversial question but with the uh
 
04:37:19.990 --> 04:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
rather strict
 
04:37:23.269 --> 04:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
criteria that the tcmob came up with
 
04:37:25.670 --> 04:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
um i think they will be at least
 
04:37:27.269 --> 04:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
understanding if this gets passed they
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
weren't adamantly against it by any
 
04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
means i would also just want to quickly
 
04:37:32.789 --> 04:37:32.799 align:start position:0%
comment on that issue about that first
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
section it is just clarifying some
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
language about the
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
the immunity for the alternative
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
treatment center it has it just simply
 
04:37:43.109 --> 04:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
adds because the original language just
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
said if they're giving this information
 
04:37:47.349 --> 04:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
to qualifying patients but we know that
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of patients have designated
 
04:37:51.269 --> 04:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
caregivers and it allows it to be able
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
to be dealing with designated care
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
caregivers and visiting qualifying
 
04:37:56.869 --> 04:37:56.879 align:start position:0%
patients so it really is just a
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
technical correction um that's really
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
all i have and basically again in
 
04:38:00.959 --> 04:38:01.910 align:start position:0%
all i have and basically again in
summary

04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
summary
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
oud is reasonable to consider with a
 
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
mixed feeling from the
 
04:38:08.949 --> 04:38:08.959 align:start position:0%
board and uh the other things we've
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
really kind of taken care of and the
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
other some of the issues which have to
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
do with much more mechanical and not
 
04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
medical i'm going to defer to michael
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.949 --> 04:38:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.230 --> 04:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um thank you
 
04:38:32.480 --> 04:38:34.070 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um thank you
representative

04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:34.080 --> 04:38:34.949 align:start position:0%
representative
um

04:38:34.949 --> 04:38:34.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'd like to uh piggyback onto something
 
04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative weber said earlier about
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
the senate and omnibus bills
 
04:38:46.150 --> 04:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
um when i look at section uh the first
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
point in the analysis
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
04:38:52.629 --> 04:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
just a cleanup kind of legal issue
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
the other is the oud
 
04:38:59.910 --> 04:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
which is a more complex medical issue
 
04:38:59.920 --> 04:39:00.949 align:start position:0%
which is a more complex medical issue
um

04:39:00.949 --> 04:39:00.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
the permit out of state residents
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
almost seems like a commerce type issue
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
would it now be better for all of us and
 
04:39:13.510 --> 04:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
our brains and handing this over to the
 
04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
personally i think that would have been
 
04:39:23.830 --> 04:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
better i i'm not i know omnibus bills
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
can be more efficient in some senses but
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
you're right when we're dealing with
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
medical questions and we're linking them
 
04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
together with uh
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
correcting language and linking together
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
with some extensions and changes i think
 
04:39:36.629 --> 04:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
it can make it difficult to pass which
 
04:39:38.948 --> 04:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
is why i think for example uh the
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
insomnia and asd are better to just stay
 
04:39:43.430 --> 04:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
in 89 because that's a clean bill
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
without a lot of other
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
baggage that might bring down
 
04:39:50.628 --> 04:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
that the passage of those qualifying
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
conditions so i wish it were the case um
 
04:39:55.750 --> 04:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we can
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
divide the bill or not i'm not sure if
 
04:39:59.350 --> 04:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's our capability but a lot of it
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
can just be amended out
 
04:40:02.550 --> 04:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i know that we have an amendment
 
04:40:04.150 --> 04:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
that has been sent out by representative
 
04:40:05.990 --> 04:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
marsh i think it might have end out too
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
much because it leaves out the
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition
 
04:40:12.230 --> 04:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
condition of oud if i remember right but
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:17.910 --> 04:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
um this uh i'm not quite sure
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair who i should address this to
 
04:40:28.230 --> 04:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh he brought uh representative knick
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
brought up the question of whether or
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
not going to be broken out into separate
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
bills so this might be your question or
 
04:40:38.470 --> 04:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative weber's question
 
04:40:38.480 --> 04:40:39.750 align:start position:0%
representative weber's question
um

04:40:39.750 --> 04:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
how far is where
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
should we even look at that
 
04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
my experience and knowledge i don't
 
04:40:49.270 --> 04:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
think we can't break this bill up in a
 
04:40:51.430 --> 04:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
number of places and send them to one of
 
04:40:53.350 --> 04:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
the committees that should be
 
04:40:57.350 --> 04:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
sailed but uh okay thank you
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative knurk for taking this
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
question first i'd like to just like to
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
add that the um
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis cultivation bill also was exact
 
04:41:15.030 --> 04:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
and um yeah voted ought to pass in this
 
04:41:16.868 --> 04:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
committee too so that is another one
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
04:41:20.948 --> 04:41:20.958 align:start position:0%
edited out of this bill
 
04:41:24.788 --> 04:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
my question really revolves around um
 
04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
all the specific considerations in the
 
04:41:30.550 --> 04:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
oud bill
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:41:34.590 --> 04:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
specific kinds of
 
04:41:34.600 --> 04:41:36.310 align:start position:0%
specific kinds of
providers

04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
specific kinds of products at the atc
 
04:41:41.910 --> 04:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
this would also apply to the autism
 
04:41:41.920 --> 04:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
this would also apply to the autism
spectrum

04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
spectrum
 
04:41:44.000 --> 04:41:46.550 align:start position:0%
spectrum
disorder

04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
amendment that we looked at before
 
04:41:52.150 --> 04:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
and um i'm asking this in naivete i just
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
don't know how it works well enough and
 
04:41:54.560 --> 04:41:55.910 align:start position:0%
don't know how it works well enough and
um

04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
it seems like most of the qualifying
 
04:42:00.708 --> 04:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
conditions earlier on were just black or
 
04:42:02.948 --> 04:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
white you got qualified or you didn't so
 
04:42:06.070 --> 04:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how onerous these specific
 
04:42:09.590 --> 04:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
considerations are for
 
04:42:13.510 --> 04:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
patients practitioners the atc's to
 
04:42:16.740 --> 04:42:16.750 align:start position:0%
actually keep track of and
 
04:42:16.750 --> 04:42:19.510 align:start position:0%
actually keep track of and
[Music]

04:42:19.510 --> 04:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
use the specific considerations it seems
 
04:42:25.110 --> 04:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
like a lot more it seems a lot more
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
complicated but maybe it isn't so you're
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
the one to ask
 
04:42:32.550 --> 04:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
well here's the issue remember
 
04:42:33.910 --> 04:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
in the beginning
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
it was a bunch of legislators that
 
04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
passed this based on testimony we didn't
 
04:42:39.910 --> 04:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
do the kind of deep dive that tcmob does
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
and you those of you our providers know
 
04:42:45.350 --> 04:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
just how much time a lot of providers
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
can spend really
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
digging deep and into all the details
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
about treatment and what's the best way
 
04:42:53.190 --> 04:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
to do something i mean if we read any
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
clinical guidelines you know that
 
04:42:56.390 --> 04:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
they're really long and a lot of
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
information in them because it is always
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
really straightforward we this is an
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
intentionally high barrier because again
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
it is not something where everybody with
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
oud ought to just start taking
 
04:43:08.868 --> 04:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis because we don't
 
04:43:10.470 --> 04:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
want to cause harms
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
by too much thc which may be
 
04:43:14.708 --> 04:43:14.718 align:start position:0%
counterproductive so the goal was to
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
have somebody who knows what they're
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
doing so somebody who treats addiction
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
or medical medication assisted treatment
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
and with really dealing with the
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
cravings and withdrawal is the primary
 
04:43:23.600 --> 04:43:24.550 align:start position:0%
cravings and withdrawal is the primary
thing

04:43:24.550 --> 04:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
so with all that in mind
 
04:43:29.350 --> 04:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
this is one where it is so dicey now it
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
may be that when we go back and revisit
 
04:43:32.788 --> 04:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
some of those other older qualifying
 
04:43:34.230 --> 04:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
conditions we may add some more
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
conditions would it be burdensome
 
04:43:39.590 --> 04:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
yes and no i mean it means that the the
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
patient simply can't go to their pcp and
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
say hey doc i want to try therapeutic
 
04:43:45.190 --> 04:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis because i've been really having
 
04:43:46.310 --> 04:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems for the last three
 
04:43:48.230 --> 04:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
years with my heroin addiction
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh probably a primary care doc shouldn't
 
04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
be doing that but if they are waivered
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
to do medication assisted treatment or
 
04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're an addiction psychiatrist they
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
would have the quality understanding as
 
04:43:59.830 --> 04:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
to how this all works and we have these
 
04:44:01.030 --> 04:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
kind of people on the board which is
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
what makes this such a robust discussion
 
04:44:04.708 --> 04:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
for for that provider if you ask your
 
04:44:08.948 --> 04:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
person who's already taking you through
 
04:44:10.708 --> 04:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
on your suboxone therapy or something
 
04:44:12.788 --> 04:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
like that they'll be aware of this and
 
04:44:14.310 --> 04:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
they can just say you know either yes or
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
no as far as the department michael holt
 
04:44:17.750 --> 04:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
will have to answer that but i would
 
04:44:20.550 --> 04:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
presume it's not overly burdensome
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
because they would just have a they
 
04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
would just look at the credentials of
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
the person who sent in the certification
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
but it does add probably a little
 
04:44:28.948 --> 04:44:28.958 align:start position:0%
complexity but these are bars that we
 
04:44:30.868 --> 04:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
set intentionally to make it more
 
04:44:33.510 --> 04:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
difficult because we don't have the kind
 
04:44:35.430 --> 04:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
of straightforward fda approval because
 
04:44:38.628 --> 04:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
it's a schedule one drug
 
04:44:38.638 --> 04:44:39.750 align:start position:0%
it's a schedule one drug
follow-up

04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
oh yes sir
 
04:44:43.270 --> 04:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
yes um maybe you've already said this
 
04:44:45.430 --> 04:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
but i understand the clinical
 
04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
considerations completely and i think
 
04:44:50.070 --> 04:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
you've done an incredibly thorough job
 
04:44:50.080 --> 04:44:51.590 align:start position:0%
you've done an incredibly thorough job
um

04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
so it's really just the practicality you
 
04:44:55.910 --> 04:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
know if we make it clinically sound but
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
then too complicated to use it kind of
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
defeats the purpose so i would look
 
04:45:03.030 --> 04:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
forward to hearing from mr holt about
 
04:45:03.040 --> 04:45:04.230 align:start position:0%
forward to hearing from mr holt about
um

04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
how smooth he feels that this could be
 
04:45:06.240 --> 04:45:07.830 align:start position:0%
how smooth he feels that this could be
accommodated

04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
accommodated
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
right and the other thing that is
 
04:45:10.868 --> 04:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
interesting is again this is when the
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
great virtues of having a patient
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative we're currently
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
on our meeting in a week and a half
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to be hashing through sb 29
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
04:45:22.150 --> 04:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
another bill and one and one of the
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
things that we are really troubled with
 
04:45:27.030 --> 04:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
is does it set up too many barriers
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh for people uh because it has a limit
 
04:45:31.990 --> 04:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
on the on the um
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
on the strength of thc that would be
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
available in a dispensary for somebody
 
04:45:39.750 --> 04:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
who's under age 21. and the question is
 
04:45:40.948 --> 04:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
you know we agree with the medical
 
04:45:42.390 --> 04:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
concept but same with thing you're
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
saying is it too much of a barrier so we
 
04:45:46.230 --> 04:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
do take that into account and that's
 
04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
where that patient representative and
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
the at representatives really help us a
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
lot because they did not have too many
 
04:45:54.708 --> 04:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
they didn't have any difficulties with
 
04:45:58.390 --> 04:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
this particular issue um on on this one
 
04:45:59.910 --> 04:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
but it is it is something we do take
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:07.830 --> 04:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else for representative canark
 
04:46:10.788 --> 04:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
seeing no one but then the jerk calls on
 
04:46:22.628 --> 04:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:23.990 --> 04:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh hello mr chair members of the
 
04:46:25.590 --> 04:46:25.600 align:start position:0%

04:46:36.628 --> 04:46:36.638 align:start position:0%
about house bill 605
 
04:46:36.638 --> 04:46:37.750 align:start position:0%

um
the

04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
so um so yeah i'm happy to happy to
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%

04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to provide some a little
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
bit of clarity on the framework here so
 
04:46:50.310 --> 04:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh to to echo uh representative cushing
 
04:46:53.430 --> 04:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is all of the bills from last
 
04:46:56.788 --> 04:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
session that passed at least one uh
 
04:46:59.590 --> 04:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
chamber of the legislature and uh was
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
tabled by the other
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
chamber so this is an omnibus bill from
 
04:47:05.190 --> 04:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
every piece of legislation tcp
 
04:47:07.030 --> 04:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that passed at least one
 
04:47:09.190 --> 04:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
chamber from last year
 
04:47:11.910 --> 04:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
there are a total of eight provisions in
 
04:47:15.030 --> 04:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
in this bill um seven of which are
 
04:47:18.868 --> 04:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
listed on page one the analysis section
 
04:47:18.878 --> 04:47:20.070 align:start position:0%
listed on page one the analysis section
um

04:47:20.070 --> 04:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:22.868 --> 04:47:22.878 align:start position:0%
of those eight total provisions
 
04:47:26.230 --> 04:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
two the first two are part of the
 
04:47:28.708 --> 04:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
department requested omnibus bill which
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
is currently in uh the senate senate
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill 162.
 
04:47:36.550 --> 04:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
four of the remaining ones have been
 
04:47:38.788 --> 04:47:38.798 align:start position:0%
have standalone bills that this
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
committee has already exect on
 
04:47:44.868 --> 04:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
there are two provisions left of which
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is the only
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle for consideration
 
04:47:52.230 --> 04:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
on the analysis section those would be
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
parts three and part five part three
 
04:47:57.910 --> 04:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
would add opiate opioid use disorder and
 
04:48:00.390 --> 04:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
part five would permit out-of-state
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
residents to access
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire atcs
 
04:48:05.920 --> 04:48:06.788 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire atcs
so

04:48:06.788 --> 04:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:09.590 --> 04:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of an amendment that would
 
04:48:11.590 --> 04:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
pair this bill down
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
to be not redundant with anything else
 
04:48:17.110 --> 04:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
in this session uh the the sections
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
related to parts three and part five
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
would be maintained and everything else
 
04:48:23.830 --> 04:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
could be eliminated
 
04:48:26.070 --> 04:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to walk through anyone who
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
the the the representative who will be
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
preparing an amendment to deal with uh
 
04:48:32.070 --> 04:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
the clean up of this bill um to make
 
04:48:34.470 --> 04:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
sure we get uh all the eyes dotted and
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
the t's crossed
 
04:48:40.550 --> 04:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
so with that i would ask the chair if
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
if that is the intent or the likely
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
intent um
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
we can talk about the two provisions of
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
this bill that are part of the
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
department's omnibus bill in the senate
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
which is the protections for tcp
 
04:48:56.788 --> 04:48:56.798 align:start position:0%
department staff to possess cannabis for
 
04:49:00.070 --> 04:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory purposes and also section two
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
or part two which um is a cleanup based
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
on an uh performance audit um by the lba
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
from 2019
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to go through these uh
 
04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
these sections of the bill that are
 
04:49:14.868 --> 04:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
redundant with our bill um in the senate
 
04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
uh that we would support that we do
 
04:49:19.270 --> 04:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
support department requested um if
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's the best use of uh the
 
04:49:23.670 --> 04:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
committee's time
 
04:49:23.680 --> 04:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee's time
um

04:49:24.080 --> 04:49:24.090 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:24.090 --> 04:49:27.270 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
i would pause there to say how much how
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
much do you want to hear from me about
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh this bill based on a potential
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
amendment coming along down the pike mr
 
04:49:38.070 --> 04:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
holt let me throw this out and i can see
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
dramatic gestures
 
04:49:45.510 --> 04:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
does this sound good to the committee
 
04:49:48.628 --> 04:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
that what we hear going forward is about
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
those parts which are likely to be
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
removed by amendment as unnecessary
 
04:49:56.788 --> 04:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
we've already done them and so to save
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
time we just hear about the parts that
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
potentially we could
 
04:50:01.200 --> 04:50:02.070 align:start position:0%
potentially we could
keep

04:50:02.070 --> 04:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
keep
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay and if it's not good to you make a
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
and if you're not sure diagonal
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay somebody fell out of a chair on
 
04:50:21.430 --> 04:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
that sorry um yes mr hall please go on
 
04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
on the parts that uh
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're likely to keep
 
04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay very good so um the two again to
 
04:50:30.230 --> 04:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
reiterate there's two sections of the
 
04:50:32.230 --> 04:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
bill um that will be coming over from
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
the senate as part of our omnibus bill
 
04:50:36.550 --> 04:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
that which we support would be uh parts
 
04:50:39.670 --> 04:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
one and two um audit related information
 
04:50:42.390 --> 04:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh to increase the uh the the duration
 
04:50:44.550 --> 04:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
of a certification for up to three years
 
04:50:46.628 --> 04:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
and also to allow department staff to
 
04:50:48.948 --> 04:50:48.958 align:start position:0%
possess cannabis for regulatory purposes
 
04:50:50.070 --> 04:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
so those are the provisions that will
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
come over we'll hear those when it comes
 
04:50:53.190 --> 04:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
over from the senate
 
04:50:55.510 --> 04:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative knurk has done a an
 
04:50:58.150 --> 04:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
excellent job introducing the section of
 
04:51:00.550 --> 04:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
the bill um that would add opiate opioid
 
04:51:02.310 --> 04:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
use disorder uh the department doesn't
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
have a position on that the tcmob is
 
04:51:08.070 --> 04:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
doing uh fine work um in this regard uh
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
the only other provision that i would
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
like to speak about and again this is a
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
provision that does not uh the
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
department does not have a position on
 
04:51:18.070 --> 04:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
um however my testimony will establish
 
04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
that it it is a value and the the the
 
04:51:23.830 --> 04:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislature should consider it or it
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
can't consider it and that is
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
the provision it's listed as number five
 
04:51:30.470 --> 04:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
on the analysis section um
 
04:51:32.788 --> 04:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
permits visiting qualifying patients
 
04:51:32.798 --> 04:51:33.830 align:start position:0%
permits visiting qualifying patients
basically

04:51:33.830 --> 04:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
patients who have
 
04:51:37.910 --> 04:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana cards from a different
 
04:51:37.920 --> 04:51:39.270 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana cards from a different
state

04:51:39.270 --> 04:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:51:41.190 --> 04:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to access new
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire's alternative treatment
 
04:51:43.840 --> 04:51:45.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire's alternative treatment
centers

04:51:45.110 --> 04:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
centers
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
um so this is the this is the main
 
04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
policy provision proposal here um
 
04:51:52.470 --> 04:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
currently under state law we have what i
 
04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
would call limited reciprocity what that
 
04:51:58.070 --> 04:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
means is that the current law allows
 
04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
out-of-state cardholders
 
04:52:04.230 --> 04:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
to legally possess cannabis in the state
 
04:52:05.830 --> 04:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire they're afforded the
 
04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
same protections
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
from arrest and prosecution for
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
possessing cannabis in accordance with
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
our state law
 
04:52:13.280 --> 04:52:13.990 align:start position:0%
our state law
as

04:52:13.990 --> 04:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents do
 
04:52:16.878 --> 04:52:18.070 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents do
however

04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:52:21.510 --> 04:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
they are not permitted by state law to
 
04:52:21.520 --> 04:52:22.550 align:start position:0%
they are not permitted by state law to
purchase

04:52:22.550 --> 04:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
04:52:24.390 --> 04:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis in new hampshire
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
or acquire cannabis through any means
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
legally in new hampshire from either a
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
patient or a caregiver in new hampshire
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
what this means is that we allow
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
visiting qualifying patients the
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to legally possess it here
 
04:52:42.150 --> 04:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
but we are encouraging them to break an
 
04:52:43.990 --> 04:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
additional federal law by carrying it
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
across state borders
 
04:52:48.390 --> 04:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
so what this bill would do
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
would allow those visiting qualifying
 
04:52:55.110 --> 04:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
patients to access the atcs here
 
04:52:57.270 --> 04:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
purchase cannabis products here so that
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
they don't run afoul
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
the the federal prohibition of crossing
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
state lines with therapeutic cannabis
 
04:53:07.270 --> 04:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
in addition this provision of the bill
 
04:53:09.670 --> 04:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
would also clarify the law
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
um for the purposes of law enforcement
 
04:53:15.190 --> 04:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
right now current law affords this
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
protection to out-of-state patients only
 
04:53:20.868 --> 04:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
if they have a qualifying medical
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
condition that is recognized by new
 
04:53:25.510 --> 04:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire state law
 
04:53:28.390 --> 04:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
so for example a common condition
 
04:53:30.868 --> 04:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic cannabis throughout new
 
04:53:30.878 --> 04:53:31.830 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic cannabis throughout new
england

04:53:31.830 --> 04:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
england
 
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
is anxiety
 
04:53:36.070 --> 04:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does not permit
 
04:53:37.830 --> 04:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
patients with anxiety to possess
 
04:53:37.840 --> 04:53:38.868 align:start position:0%
patients with anxiety to possess
cannabis

04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
what this means is that someone from
 
04:53:43.110 --> 04:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
massachusetts who has a medical
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana card issued in that state for
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
the condition of anxiety when they cross
 
04:53:49.510 --> 04:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
over the border
 
04:53:52.070 --> 04:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
do not enjoy the legal protections
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire does not permit
 
04:53:54.320 --> 04:53:55.590 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire does not permit
anxiety

04:53:55.590 --> 04:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
anxiety
 
04:53:57.350 --> 04:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
as a qualifying condition here in the
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
state what that means is that law
 
04:54:02.948 --> 04:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement personnel um in in the field
 
04:54:05.750 --> 04:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
at a traffic stop would need to
 
04:54:05.760 --> 04:54:07.110 align:start position:0%
at a traffic stop would need to
uh

04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
have internalized and know all the
 
04:54:11.910 --> 04:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
qualifying conditions here in this uh in
 
04:54:13.110 --> 04:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:54:14.628 --> 04:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:54:14.638 --> 04:54:15.350 align:start position:0%
know that
a

04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state patient may have a
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
different qualifying condition
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
require that out-of-state patient to
 
04:54:24.310 --> 04:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
also produce a letter from their medical
 
04:54:26.868 --> 04:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
provider that states that qualifying
 
04:54:29.350 --> 04:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
condition match them up all the side of
 
04:54:32.788 --> 04:54:32.798 align:start position:0%
the road during a traffic stop um so
 
04:54:35.030 --> 04:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
this this proposal would have the the
 
04:54:37.590 --> 04:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
the effect of simplifying the process
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
and grant um a broad uh recognition of
 
04:54:44.948 --> 04:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
out-of-state medical marijuana cards
 
04:54:44.958 --> 04:54:45.910 align:start position:0%
out-of-state medical marijuana cards
um

04:54:45.910 --> 04:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:47.670 --> 04:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
so those are those are the
 
04:54:49.830 --> 04:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
those are the aspects of this provision
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill that i would ask the
 
04:54:53.910 --> 04:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislature to consider
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%

04:55:21.040 --> 04:55:22.150 align:start position:0%
visible he was just muted when he
replied

04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
04:55:30.550 --> 04:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
holt for taking my question my question
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
is just one of drafting uh with respect
 
04:55:34.000 --> 04:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
is just one of drafting uh with respect
to

04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:55:37.750 --> 04:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
the analysis sections one and two which
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
you said are in a bill coming towards us
 
04:55:42.390 --> 04:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
from the uh senate
 
04:55:42.400 --> 04:55:44.310 align:start position:0%
from the uh senate
the

04:55:44.310 --> 04:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:55:47.590 --> 04:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
is the senate bill exactly like ours or
 
04:55:49.990 --> 04:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat different and do you think we
 
04:55:50.000 --> 04:55:50.948 align:start position:0%
somewhat different and do you think we
should

04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:55:55.830 --> 04:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh keep those two in just as
 
04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
belt and suspenders or do you think they
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
should be taken out entirely if indeed
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
you have an opinion if you don't want to
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
give an opinion that's okay too
 
04:56:05.750 --> 04:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative weber i
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate the allowance to not have an
 
04:56:09.350 --> 04:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
opinion uh
 
04:56:12.150 --> 04:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
um however um i i can say that both of
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
those provisions are an exact carbon
 
04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
copy of um of
 
04:56:19.270 --> 04:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
what's coming over in the senate
 
04:56:21.270 --> 04:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
um and i do not have a preference on
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not they should be maintained
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
here i fully expect
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
our omnibus bill to uh to pass the
 
04:56:29.190 --> 04:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
senate with those provisions intact
 
04:56:30.788 --> 04:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much that's very
 
04:56:32.470 --> 04:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
helpful i appreciate it
 
04:56:37.830 --> 04:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:40.230 --> 04:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh mr chair i would like to address uh
 
04:56:44.070 --> 04:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro's question about
 
04:56:46.628 --> 04:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
the department's ability to administer a
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
if i may yes
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh so representative
 
04:56:58.470 --> 04:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
shapiro um the the departments
 
04:57:00.230 --> 04:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
recognizes that it does create a
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
different standard it's not just a yes
 
04:57:05.590 --> 04:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
no check box um it will require uh some
 
04:57:08.070 --> 04:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
work on our part to verify
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
um that the providers who are certifying
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
for that particular condition
 
04:57:16.628 --> 04:57:16.638 align:start position:0%
are in fact um uh have have certified
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
specialties in those uh in in those
 
04:57:22.070 --> 04:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
fields but that's not something that i
 
04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
see as an administrative uh really
 
04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
burdensome task it will add some uh some
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but it's something that
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:39.350 --> 04:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
mr michael mclaughlin to come back
 
04:57:44.390 --> 04:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
from sanctuary alternative treatment
 
04:57:44.400 --> 04:57:49.590 align:start position:0%
from sanctuary alternative treatment
center

04:57:49.590 --> 04:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chairman but representative
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
salloway had his hand up and i believe
 
04:57:57.030 --> 04:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
it was for a question from mr holt i am
 
04:58:00.070 --> 04:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
sorry my friend
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
question away
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
after you're unmuting
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:09.440 --> 04:58:10.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:58:10.948 --> 04:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:58:15.750 --> 04:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
mr holt are you are you there
 
04:58:18.788 --> 04:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
i am thank you oh it's i've i always
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
enjoy your testimony i learned from you
 
04:58:23.270 --> 04:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
so i have a question
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
were the fda
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
drop the current categorization of
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:36.718 --> 04:58:37.830 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:58:37.830 --> 04:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:39.670 --> 04:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
that is a million dollar or
 
04:58:41.670 --> 04:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar question facing the
 
04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
entire country at this point um
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh and it's speculative um
 
04:58:50.788 --> 04:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
depending on what the federal government
 
04:58:53.430 --> 04:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
did with the federal legalization of
 
04:58:56.550 --> 04:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis um whether they they have
 
04:58:58.868 --> 04:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
options of whether to to deschedule
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
entirely uh which means it's tobacco
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
like a tobacco product or they could
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
reschedule it as a different schedule uh
 
04:59:06.550 --> 04:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
um a drug
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
um would depend would would determine
 
04:59:11.750 --> 04:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
what impact that has
 
04:59:14.310 --> 04:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
on state legal therapeutic cannabis
 
04:59:14.320 --> 04:59:15.830 align:start position:0%
on state legal therapeutic cannabis
programs

04:59:15.830 --> 04:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
programs
 
04:59:17.270 --> 04:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
one of the thoughts in the federal
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
government is to
 
04:59:21.750 --> 04:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
simply remove barriers for states to
 
04:59:21.760 --> 04:59:23.430 align:start position:0%
simply remove barriers for states to
implement

04:59:23.430 --> 04:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
implement
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis laws on their own and not have
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
a federal uh policy um so it's it really
 
04:59:32.310 --> 04:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
is speculative up in the air and um with
 
04:59:34.390 --> 04:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
the new federal administration you know
 
04:59:36.310 --> 04:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
we may see some some action over the
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
next four years um that we have not seen
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the past so to be continued i'm sure
 
04:59:43.270 --> 04:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr hope
 
04:59:43.280 --> 04:59:44.788 align:start position:0%
thank you mr hope
welcome

04:59:44.788 --> 04:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:59:44.798 --> 04:59:46.470 align:start position:0%
welcome
wow

04:59:46.470 --> 04:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
wow
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
i see no one else
 
04:59:50.830 --> 04:59:50.840 align:start position:0%
with a hand up either yellow or
 
04:59:54.150 --> 04:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise so i will now call on
 
04:59:56.708 --> 04:59:56.718 align:start position:0%
mr michael mclaughlin from sanctuary
 
05:00:00.150 --> 05:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center
 
05:00:01.830 --> 05:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
05:00:03.430 --> 05:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee i'm going to say that
 
05:00:06.390 --> 05:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
traditional can you hear me now voice
 
05:00:08.230 --> 05:00:08.240 align:start position:0%

no
 
05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
some of us can't just enough to know how
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
to answer that
 
05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:20.310 --> 05:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're not muted but you're very um it's
 
05:00:21.590 --> 05:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
hard to hear
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay are we better now
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%

sanctuary atc
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
and we are very much in favor of the
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
provision in
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%

05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
patients with
 
05:00:43.990 --> 05:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate cards from their states to
 
05:00:46.150 --> 05:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
access new hampshire atc's i would
 
05:00:47.910 --> 05:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that last year
 
05:00:49.990 --> 05:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 1150
 
05:00:51.990 --> 05:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
was heard by the committee and the
 
05:00:53.910 --> 05:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
committee voted
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
to or ought to pass on that bill and we
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
sent it over to the senate where it as
 
05:01:00.628 --> 05:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
people mentioned earlier it did die on
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
the table
 
05:01:01.680 --> 05:01:02.390 align:start position:0%
the table
the

05:01:02.390 --> 05:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:01:04.868 --> 05:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide service to
 
05:01:08.070 --> 05:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
out-of-state patients with qualifying id
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
cards is helpful in many ways to enhance
 
05:01:12.310 --> 05:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
your agencies
 
05:01:14.708 --> 05:01:14.718 align:start position:0%

conway
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
and the opportunity to be able to
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
provide quality therapeutic cannabis to
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
both people from out of state who are
 
05:01:32.708 --> 05:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
near new hampshire and to transits and
 
05:01:34.868 --> 05:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
tourists who come to new hampshire
 
05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
to experience new hampshire experience
 
05:01:37.830 --> 05:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
is very helpful
 
05:01:39.990 --> 05:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
again as michael hope mentioned it's
 
05:01:41.680 --> 05:01:41.690 align:start position:0%

05:01:45.350 --> 05:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
relieve law enforcement of any confusion
 
05:01:47.830 --> 05:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
on who may uh have the benefits of new
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire law so uh again we've been
 
05:01:54.628 --> 05:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
much in favor of leaving the out of
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
state um provisions in house bill 605
 
05:02:00.628 --> 05:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
and would only remind the committee that
 
05:02:02.310 --> 05:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
we had a very good discussion of last
 
05:02:04.550 --> 05:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
year it's a
 
05:02:06.550 --> 05:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
something the department is put together
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
and will help us enforce and i think it
 
05:02:12.948 --> 05:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
works for new hampshire thank you
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none of the chair calls on mr
 
05:02:43.910 --> 05:02:43.920 align:start position:0%

sarick
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
medical director for sanctuary atc i did
 
05:02:57.670 --> 05:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
speak earlier
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
in favor of house bill 89 which also
 
05:03:02.470 --> 05:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
adds insomnia
 
05:03:04.628 --> 05:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
to the qualifying medical conditions to
 
05:03:07.030 --> 05:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire tc law so
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
we do support that in this bill as well
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
and see and we also uh strongly support
 
05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
adding the opiate use disorder to the
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
qualifying meta conditions as well
 
05:03:23.200 --> 05:03:24.310 align:start position:0%
qualifying meta conditions as well
and

05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
as mr mclaughlin just stated too
 
05:03:29.590 --> 05:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
sanctuary atc also supports out-of-state
 
05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
patients access to our dispensaries here
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
and i in my opinion this really should
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
have been allowed from the inception of
 
05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
the program and for those of you who are
 
05:03:43.430 --> 05:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
out there that particularly um are
 
05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill don't really know
 
05:03:47.030 --> 05:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
how sort of embarrassing is when a
 
05:03:49.110 --> 05:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
patient from a different state comes
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
with a legal cannabis card
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
and basically has to be turned away at
 
05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
the door by us it's pretty embarrassing
 
05:03:56.718 --> 05:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
the door by us it's pretty embarrassing
so

05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
05:04:01.750 --> 05:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
allowing patients access
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
in a different state with a card you
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
know obviously will prevent this and
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
actually you know
 
05:04:08.550 --> 05:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
make new hampshire
 
05:04:10.470 --> 05:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
appeal a little less
 
05:04:12.628 --> 05:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
uncompassionate basically
 
05:04:12.638 --> 05:04:14.070 align:start position:0%
uncompassionate basically
um

05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:14.080 --> 05:04:16.708 align:start position:0%
um
also

05:04:16.708 --> 05:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:18.788 --> 05:04:18.798 align:start position:0%
allowing um
 
05:04:20.550 --> 05:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure was the pregnancy a part of
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sure the pregnant like allowing
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
patients education and pregnancy we
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
obviously support that by really having
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
available pamphlets of brochures at the
 
05:04:32.160 --> 05:04:35.990 align:start position:0%
available pamphlets of brochures at the
dispensary

05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
other than that i think we're pretty
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor for your testimony does
 
05:04:49.030 --> 05:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:51.030 --> 05:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you dr cyrek thank you
 
05:04:54.628 --> 05:04:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:56.628 --> 05:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who has signed up
 
05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
any co-hosts have anybody in their
 
05:05:13.200 --> 05:05:20.310 align:start position:0%
any co-hosts have anybody in their
sights

05:05:20.310 --> 05:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like everyone has spoken that
 
05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
was signed up
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you it seems to me that uh
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's quite possibly
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
05:05:30.550 --> 05:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
coming taking out certain redundant
 
05:05:33.350 --> 05:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
things and so therefore we will sit on
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
this for a week or so
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
so we we now
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on house bill 605
 
05:05:42.958 --> 05:05:47.910 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on house bill 605
and

05:05:47.910 --> 05:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.150 --> 05:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
we will go into executive session
 
05:05:57.030 --> 05:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
on house bill 2 21.
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%

i
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
have no amendments in front of me did
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
anyone bring forth an amendment that
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%

05:06:42.550 --> 05:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
no one sees any so i guess
 
05:06:44.070 --> 05:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
we're all in this together if we're
 
05:06:44.080 --> 05:06:47.270 align:start position:0%
we're all in this together if we're
wrong

05:06:47.270 --> 05:06:47.280 align:start position:0%

05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
state legislatures intervening
 
05:07:38.708 --> 05:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
in the relationship between physicians
 
05:07:39.990 --> 05:07:40.000 align:start position:0%

as being here it is in russia now you
 
05:08:18.310 --> 05:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
will see it here it is imperative
 
05:08:22.230 --> 05:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
that we have decent data to be able to
 
05:08:22.240 --> 05:08:23.110 align:start position:0%
that we have decent data to be able to
track

05:08:23.110 --> 05:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
track
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%

loud and clear against this we need to
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
build a public health infrastructure
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
it's imperative and there's no time to
 
05:08:49.910 --> 05:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
waste thank you mr chairman
 
05:09:02.070 --> 05:09:02.080 align:start position:0%

05:09:07.190 --> 05:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay um we did hear a lot of testament
 
05:09:08.788 --> 05:09:08.798 align:start position:0%
about the difficulties of having this be
 
05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
an opt-in
 
05:09:12.788 --> 05:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
and really what it amounts to is that
 
05:09:16.390 --> 05:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
it is far too easy for people to neglect
 
05:09:18.230 --> 05:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
opting into this
 
05:09:18.240 --> 05:09:19.030 align:start position:0%
opting into this
and

05:09:19.030 --> 05:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:20.788 --> 05:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
if a person really doesn't want to be in
 
05:09:22.150 --> 05:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
it they have that choice to opt out
 
05:09:24.230 --> 05:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's fine but to make it opt-in means
 
05:09:27.270 --> 05:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a very poor
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
collection of data as representative
 
05:09:31.430 --> 05:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
salloway was just commenting about but
 
05:09:33.030 --> 05:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's we've heard about the difficulty
 
05:09:34.150 --> 05:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
with communication and i don't know how
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
many of you have had this problem but i
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
know i've had a problem where i go into
 
05:09:40.868 --> 05:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
my pcp and they ask about did i get uh
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know my flu shot and when did i get
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
it and i don't remember and yes i got it
 
05:09:46.708 --> 05:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
over at the pharmacy but between the
 
05:09:48.948 --> 05:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
fact that people get their injections at
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
providers at pharmacies or now even in
 
05:09:53.430 --> 05:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
freestanding immunization clinics that
 
05:09:55.590 --> 05:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
we have going on for covid
 
05:09:57.430 --> 05:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
and that may occur again some other time
 
05:09:59.350 --> 05:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
for other diseases as representative
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
soloway has alluded to the ability to be
 
05:10:03.270 --> 05:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
able to know whether somebody's been
 
05:10:04.550 --> 05:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or not is critical
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
particularly that whole issue of
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
preventing redundant vaccinations that
 
05:10:10.628 --> 05:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
are really totally unnecessary a waste
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
of resources and might expose a patient
 
05:10:14.788 --> 05:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
to more risk because they're getting
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
a um
 
05:10:18.550 --> 05:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
immunization too early before that you
 
05:10:18.560 --> 05:10:19.270 align:start position:0%
immunization too early before that you
know

05:10:19.270 --> 05:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:10:21.510 --> 05:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
right after they've had another one so
 
05:10:23.110 --> 05:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
for the communication
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to actually have things work
 
05:10:27.270 --> 05:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's important if we look at the
 
05:10:29.190 --> 05:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
countries like israel who have been able
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
to manage very good aggressive robust
 
05:10:34.390 --> 05:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination programs a lot of that is
 
05:10:37.510 --> 05:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
because they do have health records that
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
are interoperable i mean in our case you
 
05:10:41.590 --> 05:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
know you go from a private practitioner
 
05:10:43.590 --> 05:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
to your hospital and they can't even
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
talk to one another with an electronic
 
05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
health record the ability to have
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
centralized databases for this kind of
 
05:10:50.948 --> 05:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
information should be across the
 
05:10:52.948 --> 05:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
healthcare spectrum i mean for example
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
in the va you're you're saying you live
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
in san francisco you hurt yourself in
 
05:10:58.390 --> 05:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
boston you go in the va your va patient
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
they got access to your record they can
 
05:11:01.910 --> 05:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
take care of you we can't do that across
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
our health care system for vaccinations
 
05:11:05.750 --> 05:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
at least it's a good start to be able to
 
05:11:07.670 --> 05:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
know who has been vaccinated and who
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't i don't mean for someone above to
 
05:11:12.310 --> 05:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
know necessarily except maybe for data
 
05:11:14.070 --> 05:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
acquisition for studies
 
05:11:16.310 --> 05:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
but as far as your own internal
 
05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
communication between your healthcare
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
providers and for your own peace of mind
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
to know what you've had
 
05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
i do also remember
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
having to get my vaccination records
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
when i moved out to different areas and
 
05:11:29.670 --> 05:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
trying to find out what i had for
 
05:11:31.990 --> 05:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
pediatric vaccines and when i had them
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
it's very confusing so i think that this
 
05:11:34.958 --> 05:11:35.670 align:start position:0%
it's very confusing so i think that this
is

05:11:35.670 --> 05:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
a bad idea to make it opt-in because far
 
05:11:39.910 --> 05:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
too many people will be compromised
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
without even knowing that they've
 
05:11:43.430 --> 05:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
compromised their care because they did
 
05:11:45.990 --> 05:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
not opt in if someone really wishes to
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
opt out that's fine but but do not make
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
it an opt-in
 
05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:53.430 --> 05:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
and representative woods
 
05:11:57.750 --> 05:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:12:01.030 --> 05:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to start at 30 000 feet
 
05:12:03.750 --> 05:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
and then bring it down to 10 feet
 
05:12:03.760 --> 05:12:04.948 align:start position:0%
and then bring it down to 10 feet
um

05:12:04.948 --> 05:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
when we talk about this uh we think of
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
two general themes one is
 
05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
you know the the personal aspect of it
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the privacy issue etc
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
but our charge as a legislature is the
 
05:12:18.000 --> 05:12:19.270 align:start position:0%
but our charge as a legislature is the
welfare

05:12:19.270 --> 05:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
welfare
 
05:12:22.390 --> 05:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
of our constituents of all new hampshire
 
05:12:24.550 --> 05:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh folk
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
and it's been invoked uh article 2b
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
and i read it an individual's right to
 
05:12:33.990 --> 05:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
live free from governmental intrusion
 
05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
in private or personal information is
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
natural essential
 
05:12:39.910 --> 05:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
and inherent
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
05:12:44.550 --> 05:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
however i read the next article
 
05:12:47.350 --> 05:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
when men enter into a state of society
 
05:12:51.990 --> 05:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
they surrender up
 
05:12:54.390 --> 05:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
some of their natural rights to that
 
05:12:54.400 --> 05:12:55.510 align:start position:0%
some of their natural rights to that
society

05:12:55.510 --> 05:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
society
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure
 
05:13:00.550 --> 05:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
the protection of others
 
05:13:02.550 --> 05:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
and without such an equivalent the
 
05:13:05.030 --> 05:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
surrender is void
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
so that's the balance we have to have
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
and our charge is to take care
 
05:13:12.390 --> 05:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the granite staters
 
05:13:14.948 --> 05:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
to do that we have to have good data
 
05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
and we've been asking for good data
 
05:13:17.200 --> 05:13:19.030 align:start position:0%
and we've been asking for good data
forever

05:13:19.030 --> 05:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
forever
 
05:13:20.550 --> 05:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
when i served on
 
05:13:22.868 --> 05:13:22.878 align:start position:0%
governor judd greg's commission in the
 
05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
80s whatever it was one of the things we
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
came out of it was
 
05:13:29.030 --> 05:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
this state has bad data
 
05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
and we're still wrestling with it
 
05:13:34.470 --> 05:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
but let me give you a 10 foot that's off
 
05:13:36.628 --> 05:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
the 30 000 foot
 
05:13:39.990 --> 05:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:42.948 --> 05:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
if we don't have any data about well
 
05:13:45.910 --> 05:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
example is school vaccinations
 
05:13:48.390 --> 05:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
yep we have no idea
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
whether your kid or my kid or teacher or
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
05:13:55.510 --> 05:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
has measles mumps
 
05:13:55.520 --> 05:13:56.788 align:start position:0%
has measles mumps
whatever

05:13:56.788 --> 05:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:13:56.798 --> 05:13:57.990 align:start position:0%
whatever
okay

05:13:57.990 --> 05:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
and so we have no way to advise we don't
 
05:14:03.270 --> 05:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
have the data so we can't advise
 
05:14:06.868 --> 05:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
the teachers the parents
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've got a cadre of folks here that
 
05:14:10.628 --> 05:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
have never had measles they've never had
 
05:14:12.070 --> 05:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
mumps vaccine
 
05:14:13.990 --> 05:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
just because nobody's wanted it
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
turns out
 
05:14:18.470 --> 05:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
no one's got it we don't know that
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
and so be careful what you ask for you
 
05:14:22.470 --> 05:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
may get it because let's take for an
 
05:14:24.628 --> 05:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
example mumps
 
05:14:27.990 --> 05:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
we have no idea whether they've been
 
05:14:29.990 --> 05:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or not
 
05:14:32.830 --> 05:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
but all of a sudden there's a mumps
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
appear well voila
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
kid comes home and gives it to his
 
05:14:37.200 --> 05:14:39.190 align:start position:0%
kid comes home and gives it to his
parents

05:14:39.190 --> 05:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
parents
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
well mumps specifically
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i don't know about the others but i
 
05:14:45.670 --> 05:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
speak for my personal experience i had
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
mumps as a kid
 
05:14:48.708 --> 05:14:48.718 align:start position:0%
and we know that when you bring it home
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
to your parents it can be devastating
 
05:14:53.350 --> 05:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
my mother almost had to have a
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
tracheostomy because she had such a
 
05:14:57.670 --> 05:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
violent reaction
 
05:15:00.390 --> 05:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:04.390 --> 05:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
on the male side if an adult male
 
05:15:05.990 --> 05:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
gets mumps
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's very common that they become
 
05:15:08.080 --> 05:15:10.310 align:start position:0%
it's very common that they become
sterile

05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
sterile
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:15:14.948 --> 05:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
we have to be careful about what we wish
 
05:15:17.670 --> 05:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
for because we just might get it
 
05:15:21.350 --> 05:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
and what we get we might get is worse
 
05:15:24.070 --> 05:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
so our charge i i
 
05:15:25.670 --> 05:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
really plead
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
our charge is to take care of new
 
05:15:27.680 --> 05:15:29.430 align:start position:0%
our charge is to take care of new
hampshire

05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:15:30.628 --> 05:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
with it
 
05:15:34.150 --> 05:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
within reason and it's easy to opt out
 
05:15:35.670 --> 05:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
and we understand that and that's
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
but the opt-in we know
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
we know makes it very difficult we know
 
05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
we don't get the data and therefore we
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
know we can't take care of new hampshire
 
05:15:49.110 --> 05:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
folks and we know that there's going to
 
05:15:50.788 --> 05:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
be consequences
 
05:15:50.798 --> 05:15:51.830 align:start position:0%
be consequences
so

05:15:51.830 --> 05:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
i i really
 
05:15:55.430 --> 05:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
encourage that we do not support an
 
05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:01.590 --> 05:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
05:16:01.600 --> 05:16:03.590 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
marsh

05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
marsh
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you everyone uh
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
this is a difficult bill
 
05:16:10.230 --> 05:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason it's a difficult bill is
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
because i don't like binary decisions
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
and this is a binary decision it's
 
05:16:16.070 --> 05:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
either yes
 
05:16:18.150 --> 05:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
or no
 
05:16:20.150 --> 05:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
and i see very little way to amend the
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill to make it more acceptable to
 
05:16:23.910 --> 05:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
everybody although if i were i would
 
05:16:26.070 --> 05:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
remove the word written on line five i
 
05:16:30.550 --> 05:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i think there is a great many points
 
05:16:35.190 --> 05:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
about there being need for better data
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
there is we need better data
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
on the other hand
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has not had a functional
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry for some time
 
05:16:48.628 --> 05:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
and i don't see that anything horrible
 
05:16:50.230 --> 05:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
happened to the state of new hampshire
 
05:16:52.470 --> 05:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
as a consequence of that i mean they did
 
05:16:54.628 --> 05:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
have issues in other states
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
with some childhood diseases
 
05:17:00.150 --> 05:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
but didn't happen in new hampshire
 
05:17:02.310 --> 05:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
good that's possible we don't really
 
05:17:02.320 --> 05:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
good that's possible we don't really
know

05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:17:05.030 --> 05:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
we have pretty high immunization rates
 
05:17:06.830 --> 05:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
at this point in time
 
05:17:10.150 --> 05:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
um so at the end of the day i think that
 
05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
i will not vote uh
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
i i will support the passage of this
 
05:17:15.040 --> 05:17:16.390 align:start position:0%
i i will support the passage of this
bill

05:17:16.390 --> 05:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
but in some ways it's it's it's
 
05:17:20.070 --> 05:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
reluctant um because i'd like to find
 
05:17:21.430 --> 05:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
something that's more acceptable to
 
05:17:21.440 --> 05:17:27.990 align:start position:0%
something that's more acceptable to
everybody

05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:31.430 --> 05:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
my concern i have a couple of concerns
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
one is the lack of personal
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility aren't we capable of
 
05:17:42.070 --> 05:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
having a card that we carry
 
05:17:44.150 --> 05:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
and just encourage everybody carry your
 
05:17:45.910 --> 05:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
card with you just like a driver's
 
05:17:48.830 --> 05:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
license to keep a record of these uh
 
05:17:51.910 --> 05:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
immunizations my other issue was that my
 
05:17:51.920 --> 05:17:53.030 align:start position:0%
immunizations my other issue was that my
daughter

05:17:53.030 --> 05:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
05:17:54.550 --> 05:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
my kids had
 
05:17:58.390 --> 05:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
all the shots that were recommended
 
05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
as a 20 year old in college
 
05:18:04.628 --> 05:18:04.638 align:start position:0%
she came down with a massive
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh infection of months
 
05:18:07.840 --> 05:18:08.868 align:start position:0%
uh infection of months
um

05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
it didn't protect her
 
05:18:11.360 --> 05:18:12.230 align:start position:0%
it didn't protect her
uh

05:18:12.230 --> 05:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:18:15.030 --> 05:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
so i agree it's very serious illness the
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
older you are
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
but just taking uh
 
05:18:22.150 --> 05:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
just having a registry
 
05:18:26.628 --> 05:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
which i assume encourages people to
 
05:18:26.638 --> 05:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
which i assume encourages people to
take

05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
to take vaccines
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make it happen and
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
i would think for our records
 
05:18:37.590 --> 05:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
our statistical records
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
can't everybody just report that they
 
05:18:46.230 --> 05:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
gave them out that they administered
 
05:18:48.070 --> 05:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
them without a person's name being
 
05:18:48.080 --> 05:18:49.510 align:start position:0%
them without a person's name being
attached

05:18:49.510 --> 05:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
attached
 
05:18:51.750 --> 05:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
that feels like a violation of my
 
05:18:53.510 --> 05:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
medical privacy
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
but i don't mind if i
 
05:18:57.910 --> 05:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
if my data goes in
 
05:19:00.868 --> 05:19:00.878 align:start position:0%
you know to a pool and just said we gave
 
05:19:02.470 --> 05:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
out this many
 
05:19:03.990 --> 05:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
of vaccines
 
05:19:11.590 --> 05:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you before we go to round two uh
 
05:19:16.550 --> 05:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
anybody who has not
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
yet spoken in round one representative
 
05:19:19.840 --> 05:19:20.868 align:start position:0%
yet spoken in round one representative
cushman

05:19:20.868 --> 05:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
cushman
 
05:19:22.708 --> 05:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:19:25.110 --> 05:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
um i will support this bill
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh wholeheartedly
 
05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
and i know i mentioned it in my last um
 
05:19:33.670 --> 05:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
our last executive session that informed
 
05:19:35.750 --> 05:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
consent is paramount
 
05:19:37.510 --> 05:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to any
 
05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
personal health matters
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's personal information or you
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
know taking an intervention
 
05:19:45.680 --> 05:19:47.110 align:start position:0%
know taking an intervention
to

05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
piggyback off of
 
05:19:52.310 --> 05:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative gase point
 
05:19:53.750 --> 05:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
having a vaccine registry does not
 
05:19:57.750 --> 05:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:19:59.830 --> 05:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
going off of the article 3 of the
 
05:19:59.840 --> 05:20:01.350 align:start position:0%
going off of the article 3 of the
constitution

05:20:01.350 --> 05:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
05:20:02.948 --> 05:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
it says
 
05:20:06.788 --> 05:20:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
without an equivalent
 
05:20:12.628 --> 05:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
um the surrender of your rights is void
 
05:20:14.788 --> 05:20:14.798 align:start position:0%
and you cannot guarantee that putting
 
05:20:16.310 --> 05:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
your information in the backs of the
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine registry
 
05:20:19.430 --> 05:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
protects society as a whole
 
05:20:23.670 --> 05:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
because vaccines are not a hundred
 
05:20:23.680 --> 05:20:25.270 align:start position:0%
because vaccines are not a hundred
percent

05:20:25.270 --> 05:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:20:27.190 --> 05:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
we've seen this with mumps outbreaks in
 
05:20:27.200 --> 05:20:28.230 align:start position:0%
we've seen this with mumps outbreaks in
100

05:20:28.230 --> 05:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
100
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
vaccinated populations
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:20:34.150 --> 05:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
some vaccines like the covet vaccine
 
05:20:36.230 --> 05:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
haven't been determined to even offer
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
protection to other people just the
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
received recipient
 
05:20:41.600 --> 05:20:43.350 align:start position:0%
received recipient
and

05:20:43.350 --> 05:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:43.360 --> 05:20:47.350 align:start position:0%
and
additionally

05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
putting your information in this
 
05:20:55.030 --> 05:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
database we shouldn't be tricking people
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know the arguments i'm hearing are
 
05:20:59.670 --> 05:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
well it's easy it's it's too easy to
 
05:20:59.680 --> 05:21:00.390 align:start position:0%
well it's easy it's it's too easy to
to

05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:21:03.510 --> 05:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
opt out if we require consent well that
 
05:21:05.030 --> 05:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
implies that
 
05:21:06.868 --> 05:21:06.878 align:start position:0%
you're setting up obstacles to go
 
05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
against someone's
 
05:21:12.310 --> 05:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
will on purpose to trick them into
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
obtaining their information
 
05:21:16.390 --> 05:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
so i think that this bill just needs to
 
05:21:18.628 --> 05:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
be passed and i would appreciate your
 
05:21:21.190 --> 05:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
support on that thank you
 
05:21:21.200 --> 05:21:25.270 align:start position:0%
support on that thank you
representative

05:21:25.270 --> 05:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:26.150 --> 05:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and um thank you
 
05:21:30.868 --> 05:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
everyone for hearing me out
 
05:21:32.310 --> 05:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
about a year ago
 
05:21:34.628 --> 05:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
this time covert was on its way here we
 
05:21:36.550 --> 05:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
knew it and we
 
05:21:39.110 --> 05:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
saw what was going on in italy and it
 
05:21:41.190 --> 05:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
was uh quite horrifying so i started
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
taking part in
 
05:21:43.600 --> 05:21:45.190 align:start position:0%
taking part in
online

05:21:45.190 --> 05:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
online
 
05:21:47.270 --> 05:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
ad hoc online groups to try to get more
 
05:21:47.280 --> 05:21:48.470 align:start position:0%
ad hoc online groups to try to get more
information

05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:21:48.480 --> 05:21:49.430 align:start position:0%
information
and

05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:52.150 --> 05:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
some of the groups were were
 
05:21:54.070 --> 05:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
run by epidemiologists and so forth
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
where we would actually be able to
 
05:21:57.990 --> 05:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
discuss with what are the possibilities
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
of vaccines what are the
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
the different therapeutic treatments
 
05:22:05.830 --> 05:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
for covid and it was a great resource
 
05:22:05.840 --> 05:22:07.270 align:start position:0%
for covid and it was a great resource
but

05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
little by little
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
these these groups started getting deep
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
deep platform in and in essence censored
 
05:22:16.948 --> 05:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
so what we did was we started creating
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
our own language uh coronavirus became
 
05:22:21.750 --> 05:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
cerveza sickness because we didn't want
 
05:22:23.030 --> 05:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
to trigger
 
05:22:26.070 --> 05:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
the ai bots that that listen to what's
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
going on in a youtube video and then
 
05:22:29.910 --> 05:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
delete the video if you talk about
 
05:22:32.310 --> 05:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
certain things that aren't allowed and
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
what happened was
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
the world health organization viewpoint
 
05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
became the only correct viewpoint and
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
any other conflicting information was
 
05:22:45.910 --> 05:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
banned and and it was really
 
05:22:47.830 --> 05:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
disconcerting to see
 
05:22:49.990 --> 05:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
um these groups fall apart one after
 
05:22:51.510 --> 05:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
another and and some moved to other
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
platforms other others just disappeared
 
05:22:57.030 --> 05:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
and um so if you
 
05:23:00.948 --> 05:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
i was in i was seeking good data
 
05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
and i couldn't do it because we weren't
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to have good communication
 
05:23:05.760 --> 05:23:06.708 align:start position:0%
allowed to have good communication
and

05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:09.430 --> 05:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm taking a hard hard line on on
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
these bills as much of a hard line as a
 
05:23:13.510 --> 05:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
milktoast guide like me can can make i'm
 
05:23:16.708 --> 05:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
taking a hard line on on the um
 
05:23:17.830 --> 05:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
some of these because i think there
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be pushback
 
05:23:21.510 --> 05:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
if i can't communicate
 
05:23:23.190 --> 05:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
and if i'm shut out
 
05:23:25.270 --> 05:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
of of
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
everything except
 
05:23:26.798 --> 05:23:27.750 align:start position:0%
everything except
this

05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:23:28.948 --> 05:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
this global
 
05:23:31.270 --> 05:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
organization then we don't have good
 
05:23:32.788 --> 05:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
communication and we don't have good
 
05:23:32.798 --> 05:23:33.910 align:start position:0%
communication and we don't have good
data

05:23:33.910 --> 05:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:23:36.868 --> 05:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
so you know i'm like i said i'm not a
 
05:23:36.878 --> 05:23:38.150 align:start position:0%
so you know i'm like i said i'm not a
vaccine

05:23:38.150 --> 05:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:23:39.830 --> 05:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
extremist in any way i'm waiting to get
 
05:23:43.270 --> 05:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
mine march 17th um but i i just um i'm
 
05:23:44.868 --> 05:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
really concerned that the
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
at the
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
understanding for those of us who are
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
trying to find out more information
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
being shut down on the only way we can
 
05:23:54.868 --> 05:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
communicate now which is social media so
 
05:23:57.110 --> 05:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
my my little way of protesting is i'm
 
05:23:57.910 --> 05:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
take a hard line on on this bill here
 
05:24:02.070 --> 05:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
and possibly some others as well thank
 
05:24:02.080 --> 05:24:03.270 align:start position:0%
and possibly some others as well thank
you

05:24:03.270 --> 05:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
05:24:05.520 --> 05:24:07.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
merchants

05:24:07.350 --> 05:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
merchants
 
05:24:10.390 --> 05:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:12.150 --> 05:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
a couple of things one is i think the
 
05:24:13.830 --> 05:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
patient has the ultimate
 
05:24:15.670 --> 05:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
authority to opt out
 
05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
they don't have to get the vaccine in
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
the first place
 
05:24:20.830 --> 05:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
so if they want to protect
 
05:24:22.788 --> 05:24:22.798 align:start position:0%
themselves from getting the vaccine on
 
05:24:24.310 --> 05:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
the registry itself
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
i think it's simple enough just not
 
05:24:28.550 --> 05:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
to receive the vaccine
 
05:24:30.150 --> 05:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
the other issue i look at is i think
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
people are concerned about the data
 
05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
going into a database
 
05:24:36.628 --> 05:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
and a privacy connected to it let me
 
05:24:38.708 --> 05:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
show you a story
 
05:24:40.868 --> 05:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
i went into a
 
05:24:40.878 --> 05:24:42.948 align:start position:0%
i went into a
provider

05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
provider
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
the medical assistant was going over my
 
05:24:46.708 --> 05:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
drug history
 
05:24:48.390 --> 05:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
they said oh i see mr merchants you're
 
05:24:50.230 --> 05:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
on this drug
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
a drug
 
05:24:53.830 --> 05:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
the person i was saying the provider did
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
not prescribe for me
 
05:24:57.510 --> 05:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
so i said how did you know i was on that
 
05:24:57.520 --> 05:24:58.708 align:start position:0%
so i said how did you know i was on that
drug

05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
drug
 
05:25:00.628 --> 05:25:00.638 align:start position:0%
i said oh it's in your claims data from
 
05:25:03.110 --> 05:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies we buy it
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
so therefore they were getting all the
 
05:25:07.750 --> 05:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
data for all their patients
 
05:25:08.948 --> 05:25:08.958 align:start position:0%
through the drug
 
05:25:10.948 --> 05:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
benefit program people
 
05:25:12.628 --> 05:25:12.638 align:start position:0%
unbeknownst to me
 
05:25:14.550 --> 05:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
so my privacy just went right out the
 
05:25:14.560 --> 05:25:15.830 align:start position:0%
so my privacy just went right out the
window

05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
window
 
05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
so as much as we're talking about
 
05:25:19.510 --> 05:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
privacy here i just want to let people
 
05:25:20.708 --> 05:25:20.718 align:start position:0%
know that in the new hampshire
 
05:25:22.230 --> 05:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
department of insurance they have the
 
05:25:22.240 --> 05:25:23.190 align:start position:0%
department of insurance they have the
data

05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
your pbm your drug plan has the data
 
05:25:28.230 --> 05:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
your insurance company has the data so
 
05:25:29.830 --> 05:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
if we're really concerned about privacy
 
05:25:32.070 --> 05:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
of the data and protecting it this is
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:42.708 --> 05:25:42.718 align:start position:0%
before we get to
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
round two
 
05:25:47.110 --> 05:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
let and say a few things
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm very conflicted on this i see both
 
05:25:51.510 --> 05:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
sides of it and yet i can't split my
 
05:25:51.520 --> 05:25:53.190 align:start position:0%
sides of it and yet i can't split my
vote

05:25:53.190 --> 05:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
vote
 
05:25:55.590 --> 05:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
in this very committee
 
05:25:58.150 --> 05:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
last year or two
 
05:26:00.868 --> 05:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
there was a bill asking for a very
 
05:26:00.878 --> 05:26:02.788 align:start position:0%
there was a bill asking for a very
randomized

05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
randomized
 
05:26:04.390 --> 05:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
collection of data it would be
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
randomized on abortion
 
05:26:09.670 --> 05:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
and states across the political spectrum
 
05:26:11.910 --> 05:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
from very red to very blue have this
 
05:26:11.920 --> 05:26:13.670 align:start position:0%
from very red to very blue have this
data

05:26:13.670 --> 05:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
data
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
shot down
 
05:26:17.600 --> 05:26:20.470 align:start position:0%
shot down
interesting

05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:22.628 --> 05:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
i cheered two commissions on the deaf
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
the deafblind and the hard of hearing in
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
this state
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
this is on the other hand
 
05:26:27.600 --> 05:26:29.270 align:start position:0%
this is on the other hand
and

05:26:29.270 --> 05:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:31.430 --> 05:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
there's so many things we'd like to plan
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
how many
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
such and such as do we need why do we
 
05:26:37.030 --> 05:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
need to put that how about resources do
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
we need to train more individuals we
 
05:26:41.590 --> 05:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
really wish we had data all we have is
 
05:26:44.070 --> 05:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
some stories and we're not quite sure
 
05:26:44.080 --> 05:26:45.430 align:start position:0%
some stories and we're not quite sure
how

05:26:45.430 --> 05:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
how
 
05:26:47.510 --> 05:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
that works in terms of reliable
 
05:26:50.070 --> 05:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
actionable data and every time we turn
 
05:26:51.990 --> 05:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
around there's no data
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
people are
 
05:26:55.830 --> 05:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
not signing up or there's no place for
 
05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
them to or they don't want to or they've
 
05:26:59.910 --> 05:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
been told that if they signed up and let
 
05:27:01.510 --> 05:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
somebody know they're hard of hearing
 
05:27:03.830 --> 05:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
the government will be outside and you
 
05:27:06.550 --> 05:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
know listen in on their conversations so
 
05:27:08.830 --> 05:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i hear all of this stuff going
 
05:27:14.948 --> 05:27:14.958 align:start position:0%
along um and i too wrestle with the
 
05:27:18.310 --> 05:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
the confliction of individuals rights
 
05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
and societal rights
 
05:27:23.030 --> 05:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
and they're not separate things
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're in your or an individual
 
05:27:29.030 --> 05:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
exercising his or her individual rights
 
05:27:31.430 --> 05:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes is it my expense and i'm
 
05:27:33.590 --> 05:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
losing individual rights
 
05:27:34.868 --> 05:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:27:37.510 --> 05:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
other individual exercising too many
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
individual rights i just
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure what i'm going to do
 
05:27:45.110 --> 05:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
except at the moment i'm very conflicted
 
05:27:50.230 --> 05:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.030 --> 05:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes
 
05:27:55.990 --> 05:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
point of order sir um yes uh
 
05:27:58.948 --> 05:27:58.958 align:start position:0%
representative whoever had her hand up
 
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
and she wanted round one
 
05:28:05.670 --> 05:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
whoa yes representative weber
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh this isn't round two talk is it is
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
this a point of order this is this no
 
05:28:12.548 --> 05:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
this is i i haven't had a round one yet
 
05:28:15.670 --> 05:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
you haven't no i i know you're shocked
 
05:28:17.990 --> 05:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
at that but i haven't
 
05:28:18.000 --> 05:28:18.868 align:start position:0%
at that but i haven't
um

05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:20.628 --> 05:28:20.638 align:start position:0%
one uncharacteristically
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
i invite you and thank you please to
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
great silence thank you very much and
 
05:28:26.470 --> 05:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative acton for
 
05:28:28.470 --> 05:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
looking after my interests even though i
 
05:28:30.470 --> 05:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't deserve it after my earlier
 
05:28:30.480 --> 05:28:32.470 align:start position:0%
don't deserve it after my earlier
performance

05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
performance
 
05:28:32.480 --> 05:28:33.510 align:start position:0%
performance
i

05:28:33.510 --> 05:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
here's the thing we're all grappling
 
05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
with the balance of
 
05:28:40.868 --> 05:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
individuals protection of their own
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
privacy which i think we're all for
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
and protecting society which i think
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're also all for and the question is
 
05:28:51.430 --> 05:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
where do we split the balance there
 
05:28:51.440 --> 05:28:52.390 align:start position:0%
where do we split the balance there
and

05:28:52.390 --> 05:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:28:56.470 --> 05:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
for me this bill is an easy
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
easy cut to make
 
05:29:01.270 --> 05:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
because if i care
 
05:29:05.750 --> 05:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't want my information going in
 
05:29:10.708 --> 05:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
a registry
 
05:29:12.548 --> 05:29:12.558 align:start position:0%
i've already been given
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
the option to opt out when i signed the
 
05:29:17.190 --> 05:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
thing before the pharmacist stuck
 
05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
anything in my arm
 
05:29:21.910 --> 05:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
i was told that i didn't have to go to a
 
05:29:21.920 --> 05:29:23.190 align:start position:0%
i was told that i didn't have to go to a
registry

05:29:23.190 --> 05:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
so if
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
i care about whether my information goes
 
05:29:31.670 --> 05:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
in a registry i have absolute control to
 
05:29:34.070 --> 05:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
keep it out
 
05:29:37.350 --> 05:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is whether
 
05:29:40.150 --> 05:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
the state should control for people who
 
05:29:42.150 --> 05:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
don't care
 
05:29:44.628 --> 05:29:44.638 align:start position:0%
whether they go in or whether they stay
 
05:29:44.638 --> 05:29:45.750 align:start position:0%
whether they go in or whether they stay
out

05:29:45.750 --> 05:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:29:50.230 --> 05:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
and in that case i think the state
 
05:29:53.830 --> 05:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
should not interfere i think that i i i
 
05:29:55.830 --> 05:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
i would vote on the side of data
 
05:29:55.840 --> 05:29:57.110 align:start position:0%
i would vote on the side of data
collection

05:29:57.110 --> 05:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
collection
 
05:29:59.430 --> 05:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:30:01.270 --> 05:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know the the other bills that we had
 
05:30:03.590 --> 05:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
did not have opt-out provisions
 
05:30:06.310 --> 05:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
this has an absolute opt-out provision
 
05:30:08.150 --> 05:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
for any individual
 
05:30:09.590 --> 05:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
who cares
 
05:30:12.390 --> 05:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
about opting out they may do so they
 
05:30:14.548 --> 05:30:14.558 align:start position:0%
will not be compelled to get into this
 
05:30:14.558 --> 05:30:15.750 align:start position:0%
will not be compelled to get into this
registry

05:30:15.750 --> 05:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
so why we put the default at being out
 
05:30:20.788 --> 05:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
rather than in
 
05:30:24.230 --> 05:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
i don't understand i see the opt out
 
05:30:24.240 --> 05:30:25.590 align:start position:0%
i don't understand i see the opt out
registry

05:30:25.590 --> 05:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
registry
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
as the way of having it both ways
 
05:30:30.628 --> 05:30:30.638 align:start position:0%
because if you don't care you stay in we
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
get the data and if we do care you've
 
05:30:35.270 --> 05:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
got an absolute right to keep your data
 
05:30:35.280 --> 05:30:36.150 align:start position:0%
got an absolute right to keep your data
out

05:30:36.150 --> 05:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:30:38.788 --> 05:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my analysis of the
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
thing and thank you very much
 
05:30:42.310 --> 05:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:30:42.320 --> 05:30:43.670 align:start position:0%
thank you

thank you mr chairman
 
05:30:52.948 --> 05:30:52.958 align:start position:0%
the people we usually
 
05:30:55.590 --> 05:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
respect in terms of their opinions about
 
05:30:57.510 --> 05:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
medical conditions
 
05:31:00.788 --> 05:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
all all oppose this legislation
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
dr daly from the department of health
 
05:31:05.270 --> 05:31:05.280 align:start position:0%

05:31:09.830 --> 05:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
with paula minihan
 
05:31:13.110 --> 05:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
dartmouth hitchcock hospital opposed
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire chapter of pediatrics
 
05:31:15.600 --> 05:31:16.948 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire chapter of pediatrics
opposes

05:31:16.948 --> 05:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
opposes
 
05:31:19.590 --> 05:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
and two different physicians from the
 
05:31:22.548 --> 05:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire medical society oppose
 
05:31:25.270 --> 05:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation i think that's very
 
05:31:25.280 --> 05:31:26.708 align:start position:0%
this legislation i think that's very
important

05:31:26.708 --> 05:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:31:29.270 --> 05:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
information that we should pay attention
 
05:31:29.280 --> 05:31:32.310 align:start position:0%
information that we should pay attention
to

05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
05:31:37.190 --> 05:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
and representative cushman round two
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
um so speaking to a couple of the points
 
05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
that were raised um the patient does
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
have the ultimate authority to opt out
 
05:31:49.110 --> 05:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
of receiving a vaccine yes and perhaps
 
05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
medical data that's in the chart may be
 
05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
bought and sold but this is
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
this is not we're not talking about
 
05:31:58.948 --> 05:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
you know private health providers and
 
05:32:03.270 --> 05:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:04.948 --> 05:32:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
the vaccine registry is
 
05:32:07.440 --> 05:32:08.310 align:start position:0%
the vaccine registry is
um

05:32:08.310 --> 05:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:09.830 --> 05:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know this is a government
 
05:32:09.840 --> 05:32:11.750 align:start position:0%
you know this is a government
surveillance

05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
05:32:13.990 --> 05:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
and in violation of one of our
 
05:32:17.590 --> 05:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments uh
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
um and it it it doesn't just require
 
05:32:23.830 --> 05:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
that every vaccination is reported in
 
05:32:25.190 --> 05:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
the registry
 
05:32:27.270 --> 05:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
the law currently requires even when
 
05:32:29.590 --> 05:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
someone declines a vaccine that's a
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
vaccination event
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
so you can say that oh
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:32:37.590 --> 05:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
they can decline if they want to well
 
05:32:39.350 --> 05:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
not unless they know that they can
 
05:32:41.590 --> 05:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
decline to have it put have their
 
05:32:44.310 --> 05:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
information put in there they decline a
 
05:32:47.190 --> 05:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine and you don't tell them
 
05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
or give them an opportunity to say
 
05:32:52.948 --> 05:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
i don't want the fact that i declined
 
05:32:54.230 --> 05:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
submitted to
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
the vaccine registry they're not going
 
05:32:58.628 --> 05:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
to know so that's how it would be
 
05:33:01.510 --> 05:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
tricking people into having their
 
05:33:03.190 --> 05:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
information put in there
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
and we already know that this registry
 
05:33:07.190 --> 05:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
will be used to target low vaccination
 
05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
rate areas to increase vaccination
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
uptake and compliance and since the data
 
05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
already includes who a person is
 
05:33:16.788 --> 05:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
where they live
 
05:33:17.910 --> 05:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:33:19.910 --> 05:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
what is to say that individuals will not
 
05:33:21.990 --> 05:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
then be targeted if they don't know that
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
they can opt out and say no to a vaccine
 
05:33:28.470 --> 05:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know we could see this as as
 
05:33:30.390 --> 05:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
becoming um
 
05:33:32.628 --> 05:33:32.638 align:start position:0%
quite a disagreeable
 
05:33:35.110 --> 05:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
arrangement for a lot of people who just
 
05:33:37.270 --> 05:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
want to be left alone to make decisions
 
05:33:39.190 --> 05:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
over their bodies and keep their health
 
05:33:41.830 --> 05:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
information private so just to avoid all
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
of that
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
everyone should be asked
 
05:33:46.628 --> 05:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
if they want
 
05:33:49.270 --> 05:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
their information in there whether it's
 
05:33:51.190 --> 05:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
we asking to receiving a vaccine or
 
05:33:51.200 --> 05:33:52.548 align:start position:0%
we asking to receiving a vaccine or
declining

05:33:52.548 --> 05:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
declining
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
it should be up to them thank you
 
05:33:59.830 --> 05:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:02.548 --> 05:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
yeah i think actually it was it was
 
05:34:05.990 --> 05:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
interesting because you sort of called
 
05:34:07.830 --> 05:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
me and went to representative weber and
 
05:34:09.750 --> 05:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
that was great because she made one of
 
05:34:11.190 --> 05:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
the points i wanted to make and i think
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's important this is not an opt-in
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
versus mandatory it's opt-in versus
 
05:34:18.548 --> 05:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
opt-out and that's what's so critical
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
and but representative webber covered
 
05:34:22.708 --> 05:34:22.718 align:start position:0%
that well you do have the choice to opt
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
out if you care and i agree the default
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
should be to opt in and the reason i say
 
05:34:28.548 --> 05:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
that again is not so much for massive
 
05:34:30.548 --> 05:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
state data collection i'm really again
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
looking at it more from the patient
 
05:34:33.910 --> 05:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
point of view representative gay said
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
well just keep your little card i got an
 
05:34:35.920 --> 05:34:36.948 align:start position:0%
well just keep your little card i got an
email

05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
email
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
from somebody about this bill where they
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
were commenting about their their mother
 
05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
with alzheimer's who had no clue what it
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
was that she had just had at the
 
05:34:46.390 --> 05:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacy because again we have poor
 
05:34:48.628 --> 05:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
communication back and forth uh
 
05:34:50.150 --> 05:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative marsh made a comment
 
05:34:50.160 --> 05:34:51.110 align:start position:0%
representative marsh made a comment
about

05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
that we haven't had this and talking
 
05:34:55.430 --> 05:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
about pediatrics but in pediatrics since
 
05:34:57.670 --> 05:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
the vaccinations are given
 
05:34:59.750 --> 05:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the pcp office they're not given
 
05:35:01.830 --> 05:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
in the pharmacies except for flu at this
 
05:35:01.840 --> 05:35:02.708 align:start position:0%
in the pharmacies except for flu at this
point

05:35:02.708 --> 05:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:35:02.718 --> 05:35:03.430 align:start position:0%
point
uh

05:35:03.430 --> 05:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:35:05.350 --> 05:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
that kind of communication is not a real
 
05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
problem it's there the medical home
 
05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
really needs to reside in the pcp office
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
where they know about what's going on
 
05:35:14.150 --> 05:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
with that patient
 
05:35:16.070 --> 05:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
and if they don't have the information
 
05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
about what vaccinations that patient has
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
had it can be very tricky so we also
 
05:35:22.868 --> 05:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
don't know how many
 
05:35:24.070 --> 05:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
people have gotten redundant
 
05:35:26.230 --> 05:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinations which are just a waste of
 
05:35:27.990 --> 05:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
resources because they
 
05:35:29.510 --> 05:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
didn't know when they showed up in their
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
pcp office
 
05:35:33.190 --> 05:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
so i look at it more from the standpoint
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
of protecting the patient with regard to
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
being able to get good care
 
05:35:41.750 --> 05:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
they don't know the importance of having
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
a vaccine registry so if they're asked
 
05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
to opt in
 
05:35:47.190 --> 05:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
they're not likely to necessarily say it
 
05:35:48.310 --> 05:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
and not because they're worried about
 
05:35:50.548 --> 05:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
their privacy they just don't understand
 
05:35:52.948 --> 05:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
what this is all about but if somebody
 
05:35:55.270 --> 05:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
really is worried about their privacy
 
05:35:57.030 --> 05:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
they will know about it and they're the
 
05:35:59.350 --> 05:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
one that can make that choice to opt out
 
05:36:02.948 --> 05:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
as representative weber said so i still
 
05:36:05.590 --> 05:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
think that it should be an opt
 
05:36:07.990 --> 05:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
out program because it is far better to
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
make that
 
05:36:09.120 --> 05:36:10.470 align:start position:0%
make that
important

05:36:10.470 --> 05:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:36:12.548 --> 05:36:12.558 align:start position:0%
balance as representative salloway keeps
 
05:36:14.548 --> 05:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
talking about between the individual and
 
05:36:14.558 --> 05:36:15.350 align:start position:0%
talking about between the individual and
the

05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:36:17.910 --> 05:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
the good of the society as a whole
 
05:36:23.030 --> 05:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:28.150 --> 05:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
the question before us house bill 2-2-1
 
05:36:34.868 --> 05:36:34.878 align:start position:0%
making the state vaccine registry and
 
05:36:34.878 --> 05:36:36.390 align:start position:0%
making the state vaccine registry and
opt-in

05:36:36.390 --> 05:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
opt-in
 
05:36:36.400 --> 05:36:37.510 align:start position:0%
opt-in
program

05:36:37.510 --> 05:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:36:39.830 --> 05:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
the motion was bought to pass
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
moved by representative cushman seconded
 
05:36:45.510 --> 05:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
by representative gay
 
05:37:00.948 --> 05:37:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
would the clerk please unmute and call
 
05:37:06.070 --> 05:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
that would probably help a little bit
 
05:37:09.270 --> 05:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
05:37:09.280 --> 05:37:10.150 align:start position:0%

05:45:26.390 --> 05:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
because representative merchant wished
 
05:45:29.110 --> 05:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
to bring back an amendment to his own
 
05:45:31.750 --> 05:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill so the chair recognizes
 
05:45:34.310 --> 05:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative merchant first to speak
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
on your amendment thank you mr chairman
 
05:45:39.350 --> 05:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
to my fellow
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the committee
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.190 --> 05:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
143 has amendment and the amendment like
 
05:45:48.548 --> 05:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
05:45:50.788 --> 05:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
his amendment
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
zero four four four h
 
05:45:53.280 --> 05:45:54.868 align:start position:0%
zero four four four h
dated

05:45:54.868 --> 05:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
dated
 
05:45:57.510 --> 05:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
on february 18th
 
05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
and what this amendment does
 
05:46:01.830 --> 05:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
after a conversation with the hospice
 
05:46:01.840 --> 05:46:03.430 align:start position:0%
after a conversation with the hospice
community

05:46:03.430 --> 05:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
and dealing with their concerns
 
05:46:07.830 --> 05:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
they raised the issue about a compounded
 
05:46:07.840 --> 05:46:09.350 align:start position:0%
they raised the issue about a compounded
medication

05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
medication
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
when you get into hospice therapy and
 
05:46:13.110 --> 05:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
having worked as a hospice pharmacist in
 
05:46:14.628 --> 05:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
the past
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
the challenges of trying to e-prescribe
 
05:46:19.110 --> 05:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
a prescription with multiple ingredients
 
05:46:21.350 --> 05:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
in it is difficult
 
05:46:23.430 --> 05:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
in recognizing that
 
05:46:25.750 --> 05:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
it made sense to amend the bill
 
05:46:27.510 --> 05:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
to exempt that
 
05:46:29.750 --> 05:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
i did look at the federal
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
sports act
 
05:46:34.070 --> 05:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
and in the act it does allow for carving
 
05:46:36.310 --> 05:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
out hospice patients
 
05:46:38.310 --> 05:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
the other request they had
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
was not just the question about
 
05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
temporary enough
 
05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
interoperability of the technology
 
05:46:47.910 --> 05:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
but also the access that a provider may
 
05:46:50.310 --> 05:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
have with a hospice patient
 
05:46:50.320 --> 05:46:51.350 align:start position:0%
have with a hospice patient
so

05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:46:52.470 --> 05:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
those two
 
05:46:55.030 --> 05:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
exempt exclusions were carved into the
 
05:46:58.788 --> 05:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
amendment if you look at line
 
05:47:01.430 --> 05:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
25 of the amendment
 
05:47:03.990 --> 05:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
it says exactly that a compounded
 
05:47:06.628 --> 05:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
medication a prescription
 
05:47:10.150 --> 05:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
or a hospice patient would be exempt
 
05:47:12.628 --> 05:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
as well if the provider
 
05:47:15.350 --> 05:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
has temporary access issue not the
 
05:47:17.510 --> 05:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
technology but access the technology
 
05:47:20.868 --> 05:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
that would also be exempt
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
i did leave in the
 
05:47:24.868 --> 05:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
exemption for the veterinarians written
 
05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
in such a way
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
that their exempt until the time in
 
05:47:31.990 --> 05:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
which the vet medical board determines
 
05:47:33.990 --> 05:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
the software is widely available so they
 
05:47:34.000 --> 05:47:34.708 align:start position:0%
the software is widely available so they
are

05:47:34.708 --> 05:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:47:38.070 --> 05:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
100 in control of when the law kicks in
 
05:47:39.750 --> 05:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
when they make that determination which
 
05:47:42.310 --> 05:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
is on an annual basis they would notify
 
05:47:44.230 --> 05:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
the border pharmacy at that point in
 
05:47:46.708 --> 05:47:46.718 align:start position:0%
time the law would become effective
 
05:47:48.708 --> 05:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
those are the changes i made within the
 
05:47:51.670 --> 05:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
and i would ask you for oh sorry third
 
05:47:53.520 --> 05:47:54.548 align:start position:0%
and i would ask you for oh sorry third
one

05:47:54.548 --> 05:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:47:56.548 --> 05:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
i got i just saw dr woods represented
 
05:47:56.558 --> 05:47:57.430 align:start position:0%
i got i just saw dr woods represented
woods

05:47:57.430 --> 05:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
woods
 
05:47:59.190 --> 05:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
he also wanted clarification about the
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
licensing board because it wasn't clear
 
05:48:03.990 --> 05:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the emit on the bill
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the waiver is given by the
 
05:48:08.470 --> 05:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
respective licensing board overseeing
 
05:48:11.030 --> 05:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
the licensee so if it's a medical
 
05:48:13.030 --> 05:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
practitioner it's the medical board if
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
it's a dentist it's a dental board and
 
05:48:15.990 --> 05:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
so that clarified that situation
 
05:48:19.830 --> 05:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
provided clarity into the language of
 
05:48:21.910 --> 05:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
the bill so that was the other
 
05:48:23.910 --> 05:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
change that was done within the
 
05:48:27.670 --> 05:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:29.750 --> 05:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative merchant i have in my
 
05:48:32.868 --> 05:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
notes a question asking on
 
05:48:35.670 --> 05:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
item number six which is line 24 in the
 
05:48:47.750 --> 05:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
mr chairman that is i think represent
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
brought that to our attention before
 
05:48:55.270 --> 05:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
this will become inserted into the
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
statute once the bill goes through and
 
05:49:00.548 --> 05:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%

05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
currently uh
 
05:49:59.520 --> 05:50:00.830 align:start position:0%
currently uh
being

05:50:00.830 --> 05:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:50:03.430 --> 05:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh not enforced due to some
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances around the cove 19
 
05:50:05.360 --> 05:50:07.030 align:start position:0%
circumstances around the cove 19
pandemic

05:50:07.030 --> 05:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
05:50:07.040 --> 05:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
pandemic
the

05:50:07.910 --> 05:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:50:07.920 --> 05:50:09.270 align:start position:0%
the
federal

05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
category 2 drugs to be done
 
05:50:16.230 --> 05:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
electronically was put in place to
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
combat diversion and i think that's
 
05:50:20.548 --> 05:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
entirely appropriate
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
and the two exemptions put in here by
 
05:50:24.868 --> 05:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
amendment uh make the bill workable for
 
05:50:26.868 --> 05:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians and for the hospice
 
05:50:29.030 --> 05:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
patients and so therefore i support both
 
05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:35.510 --> 05:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chairman
 
05:50:39.990 --> 05:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:50:40.868 --> 05:50:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank you

05:50:47.430 --> 05:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
thinking backing on to representative
 
05:50:50.310 --> 05:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
martin's thing about the federal law
 
05:50:52.310 --> 05:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
the date in which this becomes effective
 
05:50:55.190 --> 05:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
is the same time in which the
 
05:50:57.430 --> 05:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
cms is going to enforce if you will the
 
05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
regulation for electronic prescribing
 
05:51:01.830 --> 05:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
under part d which is again is generally
 
05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
first 2022.
 
05:51:05.590 --> 05:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
so that coincide with the federal law
 
05:51:07.430 --> 05:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to impose something
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
at the state level before the federal
 
05:51:18.708 --> 05:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:22.390 --> 05:51:22.400 align:start position:0%

a
 
05:56:17.110 --> 05:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
wobble big amendment that basically
 
05:56:19.430 --> 05:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
changes everything i'm not sure we will
 
05:56:21.990 --> 05:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
have time to do it in about 15 minutes
 
05:56:25.270 --> 05:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
and ditto on house bill 157
 
05:56:25.280 --> 05:56:26.390 align:start position:0%

05:58:15.030 --> 05:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
obviously let me know but otherwise i'll
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
work on getting that put together well
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
since you are probably the most logical
 
05:58:20.788 --> 05:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
person many of us know that is the most
 
05:58:22.708 --> 05:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
logical thing for you to do
 
05:58:25.430 --> 05:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
right i'll do it airmen point of order
 
05:58:26.868 --> 05:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
one or more
 
05:58:29.030 --> 05:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i just wanted to thank
 
05:58:31.110 --> 05:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
you for giving us the numbers of who
 
05:58:33.910 --> 05:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
signed in pro and who signed in khan
 
05:58:37.270 --> 05:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'm the pest that was um requesting that
 
05:58:41.430 --> 05:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
i just felt like on many occasions i've
 
05:58:43.270 --> 05:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
told people that that's what they could
 
05:58:46.150 --> 05:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
do to have their voices heard and then
 
05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
i feel deep sense of guilt when
 
05:58:50.788 --> 05:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
we don't know that what their voices
 
05:58:53.270 --> 05:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
were so i appreciate you're starting to
 
05:58:55.190 --> 05:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
do that i hope we can make that uh i
 
05:58:57.590 --> 05:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
understand that those numbers are
 
05:59:00.470 --> 05:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
often skewed by advocacy groups who are
 
05:59:03.110 --> 05:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
very active but i still think
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
it's part of the democratic process and
 
05:59:07.510 --> 05:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you um attempting to do
 
05:59:10.230 --> 05:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
that well representative shapiro on one
 
05:59:12.310 --> 05:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
condition is when i get ahead of steam
 
05:59:14.070 --> 05:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
and forget to do it i would like you to
 
05:59:16.708 --> 05:59:16.718 align:start position:0%
jump in and remind me please
 
05:59:18.708 --> 05:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
i'll try to
 
05:59:20.868 --> 05:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
oh anybody else can and to the question
 
05:59:22.628 --> 05:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
of how many people have been signing up
 
05:59:24.310 --> 05:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
from all over the place
 
05:59:26.708 --> 05:59:26.718 align:start position:0%
i get uh printouts
 
05:59:29.990 --> 05:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
with sometimes i get printouts with the
 
05:59:32.628 --> 05:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
city and states the person is signing in
 
05:59:35.670 --> 05:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
from on other occasions i just get phone
 
05:59:37.430 --> 05:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
numbers with area codes which can be a
 
05:59:40.548 --> 05:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
little tricky and so far most of the
 
05:59:42.628 --> 05:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
people who have signed up
 
05:59:44.470 --> 05:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
on all the things we've done today are
 
05:59:46.230 --> 05:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire people
 
05:59:47.990 --> 05:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
not that other people don't have a point
 
05:59:49.830 --> 05:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
of view but i get a little nervous when
 
05:59:51.830 --> 05:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's a groundswell moving into new
 
05:59:53.590 --> 05:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire from all over the place just
 
05:59:56.628 --> 05:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
to try to tell us what to do
 
05:59:59.510 --> 05:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else the hammer is ready to
 
06:00:01.830 --> 06:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
fall mr chairman
 
06:00:05.270 --> 06:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
well yes sir um the community report
 
06:00:06.868 --> 06:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
what do they do
 
06:00:09.830 --> 06:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh probably by sundown
 
06:00:09.840 --> 06:00:12.868 align:start position:0%
uh probably by sundown
tomorrow

06:00:12.868 --> 06:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:15.670 --> 06:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
i mean this this is grace purely because
 
06:00:18.310 --> 06:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
it used to be you can't leave the ramen
 
06:00:21.670 --> 06:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:23.430 --> 06:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
i don't want to disrupt what's going on
 
06:00:24.948 --> 06:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
in your house so
 
06:00:29.430 --> 06:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:30.830 --> 06:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay i see it
 
06:00:32.868 --> 06:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
clearly yeah
 
06:00:34.470 --> 06:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
just everybody when you're tucking
 
06:00:36.230 --> 06:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
yourself into bed tonight just think
 
06:00:38.150 --> 06:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
about the fact that i'm still up doing
 
06:00:39.750 --> 06:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
all these reports
 
06:00:39.760 --> 06:00:40.548 align:start position:0%
all these reports
so

06:00:40.548 --> 06:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:42.628 --> 06:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
if i look blurry i'd tomorrow when i
 
06:00:44.708 --> 06:00:44.718 align:start position:0%

06:00:58.628 --> 06:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
um yeah or a hug or an elbow bump or
 
06:01:01.110 --> 06:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
whatever something yeah
 
06:01:03.110 --> 06:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're getting closer and closer now to
 
06:01:03.120 --> 06:01:06.310 align:start position:0%
we're getting closer and closer now to
them

06:01:06.310 --> 06:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:07.430 --> 06:01:07.440 align:start position:0%

06:01:12.070 --> 06:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
you all and and a special thanks to the
 
06:01:12.080 --> 06:01:13.590 align:start position:0%
you all and and a special thanks to the
clerk

06:01:13.590 --> 06:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
06:01:13.600 --> 06:01:15.190 align:start position:0%
clerk
yes

06:01:15.190 --> 06:01:15.200 align:start position:0%

06:01:33.130 --> 06:01:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:01:34.390 --> 06:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:01:37.110 --> 06:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
just a reminder that they really want us
 
06:01:39.750 --> 06:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
to lead because apparently in the past
 
06:01:41.750 --> 06:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
we've been so funny that other people
 
06:01:43.590 --> 06:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
want to transfer into this committee
 
06:01:44.948 --> 06:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
that is causing the problem in the
 
06:01:48.310 --> 06:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
speaker's office so good night everyone
 
06:01:48.320 --> 06:01:49.430 align:start position:0%

i won't be with you tomorrow i wish i
 
06:01:53.670 --> 06:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
could be i'll tell you that but i'll be
 
06:01:58.548 --> 06:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:01.190 --> 06:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
give you some rewards for uh
 
06:02:06.230 --> 06:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
so they didn't respect your shop
 
06:02:11.750 --> 06:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
no they did not no they did not
 
06:02:11.760 --> 06:02:12.628 align:start position:0%
no they did not no they did not
um

06:02:12.628 --> 06:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:14.390 --> 06:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
well i'm still under a restriction i
 
06:02:16.230 --> 06:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
cannot be physically present in a
 
06:02:18.230 --> 06:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
meeting of more than 10 people even if
 
06:02:20.310 --> 06:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
they're all masked and socially
 
06:02:22.788 --> 06:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
distanced so that's a pretty high bar to
 
06:02:24.788 --> 06:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
get to
 
06:02:26.548 --> 06:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
when i am going to complete my
 
06:02:26.558 --> 06:02:28.310 align:start position:0%
when i am going to complete my
vaccinations

06:02:28.310 --> 06:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
06:02:30.868 --> 06:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
next tuesday the second
 
06:02:33.910 --> 06:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh they come around to my to the
 
06:02:36.788 --> 06:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
apartment to do it and
 
06:02:38.948 --> 06:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
then 14 days after that which is the day
 
06:02:41.110 --> 06:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
before st patrick's day
 
06:02:43.670 --> 06:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
fish 16th i'll have finished i'm going
 
06:02:46.150 --> 06:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
to go to the powers-that-be and see if
 
06:02:47.990 --> 06:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's sufficient to get me to go in
 
06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
person i'm hoping it will be
 
06:02:52.070 --> 06:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
and if it isn't i may drink a little
 
06:02:54.070 --> 06:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
more green beer on the 17th than i
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:03.750 --> 06:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
i was hoping that they'd allow us
 
06:03:05.190 --> 06:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
those of us that are really under some
 
06:03:07.110 --> 06:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
strict guidelines to
 
06:03:09.110 --> 06:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
attend in a separate room or something
 
06:03:11.910 --> 06:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
but that all got washed away with
 
06:03:13.910 --> 06:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
it i do think that i don't know if any
 
06:03:16.470 --> 06:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
of you watched the proceedings but
 
06:03:18.390 --> 06:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
our legal team really did a heck of a
 
06:03:20.708 --> 06:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
job they spent hours and hours and hours
 
06:03:23.430 --> 06:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
kind of put a case together and
 
06:03:25.830 --> 06:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
they did a remarkable job but
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:03:29.590 --> 06:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
they knew it was a heavy lift because
 
06:03:30.948 --> 06:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
trying to talk
 
06:03:30.958 --> 06:03:31.910 align:start position:0%
trying to talk
the

06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:03:34.230 --> 06:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
courts into over telling the legislature
 
06:03:36.070 --> 06:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
how to do its business is a very heavy
 
06:03:36.080 --> 06:03:37.910 align:start position:0%
how to do its business is a very heavy
lift

06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
lift
 
06:03:40.230 --> 06:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
well that's a shame candidate uh
 
06:03:43.030 --> 06:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
your perspective is always welcome and
 
06:03:45.030 --> 06:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
um you should be able to vote if you're
 
06:03:47.110 --> 06:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
not happy with how that turned out no
 
06:03:51.990 --> 06:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's i'm certainly not it's it's i
 
06:03:54.390 --> 06:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
i wish i could do my job but what can
 
06:03:59.030 --> 06:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:01.110 --> 06:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing is apparently from
 
06:04:02.948 --> 06:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
what the clerk told me
 
06:04:05.110 --> 06:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
at the last session there were 44 people
 
06:04:05.120 --> 06:04:08.310 align:start position:0%
at the last session there were 44 people
absent

06:04:08.310 --> 06:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:10.628 --> 06:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
34 were democrats and 10 were
 
06:04:12.868 --> 06:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
republicans now i don't know if the 10
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
republicans were not there for the same
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
reasons i wasn't there or if they were
 
06:04:16.798 --> 06:04:17.590 align:start position:0%
reasons i wasn't there or if they were
just

06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:04:19.190 --> 06:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
ill or something like that i don't
 
06:04:21.190 --> 06:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
really know but it's interesting that at
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
least it was a little more bipartisan
 
06:04:25.990 --> 06:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
show up than i would have imagined
 
06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
